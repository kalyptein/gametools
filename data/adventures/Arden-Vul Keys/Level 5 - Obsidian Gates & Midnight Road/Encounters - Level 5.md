### Tombs

#####  Areas 5-9, 5-10 to 5-14, 5-15 to 5-17, 5-36 to 5-40, 5-57 to 5-62, 5-85

* Common sense needs to be used in these areas. They have no inhabitants that wander.
	* Once penetrated by PCs, they might be subject to encounters.
	* In such cases, use the table for the Vicinity of the Obsidian Gates.
* 1-in-8 chance every 4 turns

### The Great Chasm

##### Areas 5-32 to 5-35

* Use the Middle Chasm table (see 5-34)

### Goblin Caves

##### Areas 5-43 to 5-51

So long as the goblins still inhabit these caves, goblins form the only possible random encounter. Loud noise or combat in one of these caves brings Killik (5-46) and all other goblins from these areas at a run. If the goblins have been exterminated or have retreated to SL5, then use the random encounters charts for the Vicinity of the Obsidian Gates.

* (goblins present) 1-in-6 chance every 2 turns

Sir Calculor, the Sun-Scarred Knight (see new monsters), 10th-level male human fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC -2; MV 120’; HD 9+3; HP 88; #AT 3/2; Dmg 7-13 (broadsword +2).

* Sir Calculor is on a private mission for Psalor-Ki, the vivisectionist (5-72), to locate a working GnuCoder 5000 full-immersion sensory experience (see new technological items) and, if possible, bring it to Psalor-Ki. The only such devices are to be found at 5-97, and they are immovable (Psalor-Ki’s insanity has overlooked this fact). Sir Calculor ascended to the Midnight Road from area 6-166. With his newly-acquired pale green rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items) he is able to open many rudishva doors. Still, Sir Calculor is stumped at how to proceed but, because this is a private, unregistered mission, he is most anxious to go undiscovered. He avoids conversation and, if pressed, will attack.
