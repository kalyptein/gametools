## Overview

As the home of the legendary Obsidian Gates and Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6), Level 5 is only sought by the boldest and best-informed adventurers.

Because the former rudishva areas known as the Midnight Road are warded against many spells (see below), few have succeeded in penetrating the famously-impenetrable gates. Should a hardy group pass the Obsidian Gates, they will find a veritable plethora of riches in the form of exotic, powerful, and valuable rudishva devices, treasures, and information. 

Elsewhere, the level contains numerous hidden tombs, mostly of Archontean functionaries (e.g., 5-16, 5-57 to 5-62), as well as the lair of the vivisectionist, Psalor Ki (5-66 to 5-74), and a forgotten secret temple of Thoth (5-77 to 5-83), now corrupted by a terrible demon.

The Great Chasm (5-34) allows travel up to level 3 and down to level 6 and is crossed here by the iconic Sundered Span (5-35).

### Significant Regions of Level 5

##### The Obsidian Gates and Environs (5-1 to 5-31, 5-41, 5-42)

This region holds two of the most iconic regions found in Arden Vul, sites that hardy explorers speak of in hushed whispers. The Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6), with its strong aura of magical despair, leads directly to the vaunted Obsidian Gates, 20’-tall valves of highly enchanted solid obsidian (5-6D).

The lure of fabulous treasure lying behind the nearly-impenetrable gates has gripped 
adventurers since the glory days of the ancient Archontean Empire, although few indeed have succeeded in passing them.

Surrounding the Hall are numerous lesser chambers containing important historical evidence, forgotten tombs, and deadly threats.

The cave of Gog (5-2) is less well-known, but another regular stop for adventurers hoping to persuade Gog to aid them in their exploration. 

Factions
* No faction controls this area, as all are intimidated by the Obsidian Gates and the Forty Pillars.

Construction
* The core of the area (5-6, 5-18, 5-25, 5-41, 5-42) was built by the heqeti, and feature usual heqeti stonework (pebbled, oily), with extra-tall ceilings (20-35’); the doors (5-6D, 5-6E, 5-6F) are described individually.
* Two rudishva chambers are found here (5-30, 5-31), and rudishva iris doors may also be found at 5-18 and 5-25.
* The Archonteans built tombs in and around the heqeti regions; these areas are of typical Archontean stonework, with 10’ ceilings and iron-bound wooden doors.

Environment
* The area is noticeably humid, due to the river running through 5-2.

##### The Midnight Road (5-84, 5-86 to 5-141)

The Midnight Road proper is the broad, tall corridor (5-91) running through the heart of the old rudishva settlements within Arden Vul. This ‘road’ linked important rudishva sites, including the cloister and transportation hub (5-92, 5-94), the rudishva forge (5-89), the lair of a tribe of debased and inbred varuda (5-111), the armory (5-118), the legendary troll pits, where the rudishva bred new varumani (5-131), and the top point of the massive rudishva great pillar (5-138), which one can use to travel all the way to level 9.

As the Archonteans never penetrated the Obsidian Gates, significant troves of rudishva-era knowledge, treasure, and technological devices can still be found here. The region carries a 
mystique to it, as many of the intelligent factions of Arden Vul (and a few knowledgeable outsiders) are aware that the region exists, or used to exist, even if none has been able to access it for millennia.

Factions
* No faction controls this region since none of the factions know how to access it.
* Should a route to the Midnight Road be opened become known, the varumani and kaliyani would move swiftly to try to occupy the region. 

Construction
* All worked areas date to the rudishva period. Most doors are of the dilating iris variety, and ceiling heights are typically 12’ tall (except when otherwise noted).

Environment
* All of the rudishva areas are warded against spells such as teleport and passwall. The region is notably cooler and drier than the rest of the Halls (45 degrees F).

## Level 5: 1 - 15

### 5-1: Secret Door, w/ Stairs up to 3-12

* A secret door is cleverly worked into the stone along the cave wall.
	* It reveals stairs leading up 250’ to area 3-12.
	* It has no mechanism, but rather can be pushed or pulled open.

### 5-2: Cave of Gog

* This vast cavern is some 50’ tall and filled with stalactites and stalagmites.
	* The atmosphere is oppressively damp and humid.
	* Utterly dark and still, broken occasionally by the bats and the sounds of cave-crickets and moving water.
	* A subterranean river runs through the cave, creating a dark pool.
		* The pool contains blind crayfish and cave-fish.
		* A vicious current eastern end will sweep the unwary towards the falls at 5-2a.
	* A rocky island stands in the pool, where lives a lesser varumani named Gog.
		* Gog navigates the pool in a simple dugout canoe.
		* The rocky isle has many crannies, two of which contains his ‘pretties’. 
			* Obvious cranny: 6-12 gems (1d6 x 10 gp each), 13 ancient octagonal platinum coins, and a heavy sack filled 247 sp, 123 cp, and 101 ancient silver pennies. 
			* Hidden cranny (detect as secret door): a full set of six colored glass activation squares, troll thegn’s passport, a moldy piece of parchment (his treaty with the beastmen), and the ring of Zox (new).
	* West of the pool is a Thothian teleportation ring (RE-GR-WH-BL-BK-YE).
		* There are no glass activation squares, but Gog possesses a full set and knows 4 addresses.
	* The one-way door from 5-9a is obvious, but impossible to open from this side.

Chute Landing
* The chute from 3-15c deposits its victims in an unceremonious heap on the sand just at the mouth of the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6).
* If the PCs didn't arrive by the chute, 15% that 1d4 individuals hurtle down the chute while the PCs are present (50% adventurers, 50% grimalkin from Level 3).

UP-11 Teleporter
* Gog’s cave is one of the destinations for the UP-11 teleporter, arriving before the entrance to the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6).

Gog, lesser varumani (new): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 61; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.
* Possessions: club, cloak of wise negotiating (new).

* Gog, an elderly lesser varumani, makes his home here.  He is clever, curious and only sometimes malicious.  Speaks in feigned "low-cunning" voice to hide his intelligence.
	* Attitudes:
		* Fancies himself a custodian of the subterranean environment, dislikes those who slaughter the flora and fauna or damage the natural rock formations.
		* Has a paternalistic fondness for the goblins, even protecting them
		* Fears the Cult of Set and won’t deal with them.
		* Hates the lizardmen and will ambush them on his rare encounters with them.
		* Signed a formal non-aggression treaty with the beastmen (has a parchment signed by Count Skleros and Deino, see 3-158), but loves beastman flesh above all else, and ambushes them when he thinks he can get away with it.
			* Gog might encourage newcomers to act against the beastmen, but won't let himself be actively linked to such actions.
	* Enjoys conversation, eagerly trades information with any non-hostile group.
		* His enchanted cloak lets him converse with nearly everyone.
		* If attacked, he leaps into the river and swims upriver. He'll never trade with those who attacked him, and may attempt to ambush a weakened party.
		* Until his trust is won, Gog subtly omits important details, ‘forgetting’ key intersections, underplaying threats, etc.
			* A party can gradually win the grudging respect of Gog through humble speech, copious gifts, and the slaughter of his enemies.
		* Gog has been charmed by the vampire, Cinna Minux (7-122), who occasionally visits to learn of those with whom Gog has chatted.
	* Knowledge
		* Readily trades...
			* Full knowledge of the non-secret regions of Levels 3 and 5.
			* Some out-of-date information about the lower levels.
			* Well-informed of monsters and faction politics of the upper levels.
		* If he trusts you...
			* Gives advice not layered with ‘tricks,’
			* Knowledge of  more esoteric areas (Troll Lift, the Inn of the Lost, the court of the troll thegn, etc).
				* His source, which he will not reveal, is Riglon in 5-54.
			* Thothian teleportation ring operation and the addresses for 5-2 (here), 3-3 (Floating Head), 4-122 (near Red Bridge of Set), and 6-64 (The Corner, near the Arena).
	* Desires:
		* Food: but only the highest quality (prepared foods or raw meat, preferably beastman meat; rations elicit a contemptuous snort).
		* ‘pretties’: he is perfectly aware of the value of precious metals and gems
		* News: up to date knowledge of the dungeon's changes (factions, etc).
		* Revenge / Exoneration
			* Gog has been unjustly exiled from the court of the troll thegn (7-30) due to the lies of a sleazy lesser varumani named Muq (8-151).
			* Gog would very much like to locate Muq and force him to admit his machinations, and will offer eternal friendship to those who bring word of Muq. Producing the incriminating documents held by Muq (8-151) would also do the trick.
			* Muq framed Gog for a crime, something treasonish?
			* Conspiring with the kaliyani against the thegn / court for gain.  Actually it's Muq who cut this deal, framing Gog, helping the kaliyani by disrupting the court.

##### 5-2a: River and Waterfall

* The river exiting Gog’s pool has a vicious current. Attempting to swim or cross requires a Strength check (as hard stuck door) or be swept down the river and over the waterfall.

### 5-3: Natural Cavern

* Reached by an 80-degree downward slope from Gog’s cave, this cavern is rocky and moist.
	* Its floor is a 25’ below that of 5-2, but the ceiling is equal height of that of 5-2.
	* The cavern is home to scores of bats, as well as 6 piercers.
		* Noise in the cave might attract the bats from 5-4 (33%).
	* Several dead bodies litter the floor, including a goblin and a human.
		* Corpses: stone axe; 27 cp, 2 crystals (10 gp each); 3 small pearls (60 gp each); a scroll with three canticles of the Litany of Light; and a silver Sortian eye.
	* 15' up the east wall, near the passage to 5-4 is a secret door to 5-36.
		* Camouflaged as part of the natural cavern, but a black, lidded eye has been painted over it.  Open by covering the eye and saying (Mithric) “Open”.
		* May also be battered down (AC 1, HP 50). 

6 piercers: SZ M(x3) and S(x3); AL N; AC 3; MV 10’; HD 3(x3) and 2(x3); HP 22, 18, 15, 14, 11, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 3-18 (x4) and 2-12(x4). Special attacks: 95% to surprise prey.

### 5-4: Bat Cave

* This large cave is 40’ tall and difficult to traverse.
	* A wide opening in the northeast leads to the edge of the Great Chasm (5-34), where the river used to fall to the chasm floor (its new channel takes it through 5-2a).
	* 30’ up the cave's north end is a worked stone porch with 2 doric columns (5-15).
		* Those climbing to 5-15 may provoke a swarm of bats (dex check or fall).

150 ordinary bats: SZ S; AL N; AC 8; MV 10’, 240’ flying (Class B); HD 1-2 HP; HP 2(x75), 1(x75); #AT 1; Dmg 1.

1-6 giant bats: SZ S; AL N; AC 8 (5 vs missiles); MV 30’, 180’ flying (Class C); HD 1-4 HP; HP 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1; #AT 1; Dmg 1-2. Special attacks: 1% chance of rabies.

### 5-5: Natural Cavern

* This natural cavern's uneven floor slopes upward to the north.
	* 3 carcass creepers make their home here.
	* A careful search (1d2 turns) reveals a lime-encrusted ceramic jug with images of snakes inscribed in black ink on the outside.
		* Inside: 339 ancient silver pennies, a 10”-tall, silver statuette of a frog (90 gp).

3 carcass creepers: SZ L; AL N; AC 3 (head) or 7 (body); MV 120’; HD 3+1; HP 20, 17, 16; #AT 8; Dmg nil. Special attacks: paralysis.

### 5-6: Hall of Forty Pillars

* A ledge 20’ off the floor of 5-2 leads to the infamous Hall of Forty Pillars, an iconic location in the Halls of Arden Vul, built by the heqeti.
	* It has been used and reused by all those who delved beneath Arden Vul.
* The ceiling is a round arch 30’ high. Forty stone pillars 6’ in diameter stretch into the distance, as well as down two transepts.
	* The walls and pillars are of pebbled stone, seeming worn and even a little greasy.
	* The pillars radiate dread (-3 retainer morale, -1 to all saves for 1-d hours).
	* Sound / light in the Hall likely attracts the denizens of 5-7 and 5-8 (75% each).
* Three score large (12”) toads dwell here, harmless, but creepy.
	* Adventurers will find themselves constantly under the scrutiny of these creatures.
	* 25% of the toads are actually transformed adventurers (see 5-6d).

##### 5-6a: Hidden Door

* This pillar hides a secret door.
	* Difficult to locate (1 in 8).  Pressing a button on the floor causes a panel to slide open, revealing a narrow hole in the pillar and a set of iron rungs leading down through a tunnel of natural, roughly carved stone.

##### 5-6b: Lesser Ziggurat

* The ziggurats here and at 5-6c are as ancient as the pillars, also pebbled and greasy.
	* They rise 20' in a series of narrow steps (worn in the middle).
	* Each ziggurat summons a pair of enemies each time the Obsidian Gates (5-6d) are touched without using the proper keys.
		* The summoned creatures become increasingly more powerful as failures mount (resets after 2 hours of inactivity): 
			* skeletons -> zombies -> ghouls -> mummies -> keqemandri (new)

2 skeletons: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1; HP 6, 5; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special defenses: immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold; cutting and piercing weapons do half damage.

2 zombies SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 15, 12; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special: always strike last 

2 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 13, 11; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6; paralyzation)

2 mummies: SZ M; AL LE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 6+3; HP 44, 38; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12. Special attacks: fear; rotting disease. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from magic weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

Special: levitate; telekinesis (4,000 gp weight); project image; teleport without error; 50% chance to gate in either another keqemander or a Type I-IV demon.

##### 5-6c: Lesser Ziggurat

* See 5-6Bb 

##### 5-6d: Obsidian Gates

* An iconic location in the Halls of Arden Vul, the Obsidian Gates have blocked more explorers and tomb-robbers than any other location in the halls.
* The doors rise 20’ above the floor, made of solid obsidian.
	* They radiate magic and evil.
	* Each valve has a 4’-tall glyph incised in the obsidian, pulsing softly with brown light.
	* Keyholes 1.5” in diameter extend halfway through each of the doors.
	* Knock spells do not work on the Obsidian Gates.
* Anyone touching (even to examine) the Obsidian Gates causes undead or demonic creatures to be summoned to confront the intruders (see 5-6b and 5-6c).
* The rudishva areas behind the Gates are warded vs teleport, passwall, and similar spells.

Glyphs
* Ancient works of the heqeti cult of Tsathoggua and Kauket.
	* Glyph 1 (“Hail!”): a V imposed over two connected circles.
	* Glyph 2 ("Tsathoggua", in his lesser incarnation as the Worm of Qok): a narrow upside down U, with small carets attached to each arm of the U.
* If the glyphs are traced, with finger or implement, a dire event happens.
	* Tracing the “Hail” glyph: a caustic hailstorm falls throughout the Hall of Forty Pillars for 3d4 rounds (1d6 acid per round, save vs spells for half).
	* Tracing the "Tsathoggua" glyph: unless Chaotic Evil, save vs transform of become a large (12”) toad, if successful stunned for 1-3 turns.
	* Either: unless Chaotic Evil, also causes the lesser ziggurats to summon enemies.

Keys
* The ‘keys’ are 1.5" diameter, 15" long rods.
* To open the gates, one platinum key and one gold key must be inserted simultaneously into the keyholes.
* For the current location of all ten sets of keys, see the Arden Vul items appendix. 
* Speaking the name “Tsathoggua” before the gates in the ancient language of his cult suspends the summoning magic of the ziggurats for 1d3 days, and the doors can be pushed open without the need for keys. 

##### 5-6e: Bronze Valves

* These 15’-tall bronze doors have not been opened in centuries.
	* Like the Obsidian Gates, these doors have round 1" keyholes in each door.
	* Manipulation of these door does not summon enemies.
	* Keys: any pair of 1”-diameter rods, one silver / silver-coated, one gold / gold-coated.

##### 5-6f: Open Bronze Doors

* Originally identical to the doors at 5-6E, these have been shattered inward toward 5-6. 
* The area around the keyholes looks molten, as if blasted with intense heat. 

### 5-7: Northeast Tombs

* This hallway holds four relatively modern, Archontean-era sarcophagi, all broken and looted, containing contain nothing but a few random bones.
	* Lurking in and among the sarcophagi are 5 ghouls.
	* Sound and/or light in the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6) may (75%) attract the ghouls, although they do not pursue into area 5-2.
	* Secret Door (northeast, to 5-10): easy to locate (1 in 4), opens by pushing inward.

5 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 13, 12, 11, 11, 10; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

### 5-8: Southwest Tombs

* This hallway holds four relatively modern, Archontean-era sarcophagi, all broken and looted, containing contain nothing but a few random bones.
	* Lurking in and among the sarcophagi are 5 ghasts.
	* Sound and/or light in the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6) may (75%) attract the ghasts although they do not pursue into area 5-2.

5 ghasts: SZ M; AL CE; AC 4; MV 150’; HD 4; HP 30, 26, 25, 23, 20; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-8. Special attacks: stench; paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm

X / 30
### 5-9: Fountain and Lost Tomb

* This stone chamber is sheathed in neat, well-trimmed granite blocks and is only 6’ tall.
	* The walls are painted in extremely bright pastels, featuring geometric patterns and a depiction of bunches of grain.  Figural images of a large goblet studded with colored dots is interspersed among the riot of colors.
* The northwest end holds a 2’-tall circular basin from which golden liquid sprays.
	* The liquid is ale of surpassing flavor and freshness, but also of potency.
	* A flask-sized quaff inflicts WIS -3, CHA +2, and DEX -2 for 2 hours.
	* The ale may also be used to activate the tomb of Hugo Berrydraw.
* The southeast end boasts a 3/4-sized sarcophagus (5’ long x 2’ wide x 3’ tall). 
	* Carved into the lid is a highly-realistic, 3/4 relief image of a short human dressed in loose robes and wearing a pointed hat.  One hand holds a full-scale wooden staff; the other a large ivory drinking horn.
		* Staff of fermentation (22 charges), horn of carousing (new).
	* The sarcophagus appears to be solid;, without seam between lid and body.
		* Where it would be is an inscription (Mithric) running around the sarcophagus: “Hugo Berrydraw rests nearby, prince of charlatans, always ready with a quip and a toast, he who drenched his companions with friendship and the fruits of the barleycorn. Wake him at your peril, for his jollity will know no end.”

The ‘sarcophagus’ is in fact a solid block of granite that cannot be opened.
* Hugo lies on top of the block, not within it; the carved relief is in fact Hugo’s body.
* The wooden staff cannot easily be removed from the stone hand of the halfling.
* The ivory drinking horn, however, may be carefully prized from the effigy’s hands.
* If it is carried to the fountain and filled with ale, and the ale is poured over Hugo Berrydraw, Hugo’s spirit awakens and his stone body slowly (over 1 turn) returns to undead flesh (new).
* The undead Hugo cackles wordlessly and shouts vulgar curses (in ancient Thorcin dialect) while deploying his staff of fermentation and inflicting magical mayhem and distress on the living.
	* Should the undead Hugo be slain, his body crumbles into a heap of bones.

GM Note: Hugo Berrydraw is an infamous character in ancient Archontean folktales.
* His reputation was that of the malicious trickster (as opposed to the generally beneficent Larel One-Eye).
	* Maybe he's a fey, or some kind of troll / jotun / gnome from Thorcin myth?
	* This was a hidden shrine for his small cult in old days.
* Stories of Hugo are legion, and usually involve him causing shame, discomfort, or harm to all varieties of folk, whether or not they were deserving of it.
* How he came to be entombed in Arden Vul is unknown. 

Hugo Berrydraw, undead spirit of drunken mischief (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 0; MV 150’; HD 8; HP 48; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-4/1-4, or 1-6 (staff of fermentation). Special

##### 5-9a: One-way Door

* The passage from 5-9 leads to a one-way door into 5-2.
	* The door is obvious from 5-2, but is impossible to open from that side.

### 5-10: Looted Tomb and Coffin

* A simple wooden coffin rests on some broken masonry in this hidden chamber.
	* The walls are rough, as if decayed, flecks of color suggesting they were once painted.
	* The coffin is simply but sturdily made of oak.
		* Its lid is pried open, allowing sight of a jumble of bones and bits of equipment, all worthless.
			* Among the debris are 2 teeth of Pol (new, used to activate the head of Pol (SL6-8)).
		* Crudely incised in the wooden side: “Gregor, Priest.”
		* A scrap of parchment is wrapped around a nearby femur.
			* (Archontean) “Gregor, optimistic priest of life, fell near the Troll Lift. We left him here, but will be back to give him a proper burial. Touch his remains at your peril!”
			* A second hand has scrawled (Archontean) in blood “Still waiting, eh?” 
			* Some details of Gregor’s expedition may be found at 1-19).
	* Secret Door (northeast, to 5-11): difficult (1 in 8) to locate, opens to a floor button.

### 5-11: Lovers’ Rest?

* A thick carpet of dust covers the floor, two stone sarcophagi, and a 4’-tall pedestal.
	* The walls are plastered and brightly painted in classic Archontean style: realistic, portrait-style faces of soldiers wearing legionary armor, short swords and spears.
	* The sarcophagi are intact with lids depicting likenesses of people.
		* The style is modern Archontean (more allegorical, elongated figures depicted with a slight ethereal or spiritual flavor).
	* Between the two sarcophagi is a 4’-tall stone pedestal, like a lectern.
		* On the lectern is an inscribed lead tablet.
			* "Doom stalks our expedition.  Scarcely have I led our remnant out of the slaughter of the Caves of Blood, but new sorrow arises.  Guivrel is dead at the hand of Kaitor, before my very eyes. In a rage, I slew him as he shouted his reasons unheard. I know not what to think; there is only treachery and pain.  The woman I loved is dead at the hand of my closest friend.  I cannot see truth any more, nor am I fit to lead those who still survive.  Let the cosmos judge us, if any power pays heed to our miseries.
				* (signed) Lankios, polemarch, 2759 AEP.”
	* Those with a sense for the numinous can feel divine attention weighing upon this place.

Kaitor's Sarcophagus
* Gisant: a man in armor with a distinctive trident embossed on the breastplate, gripping a long sword.
* Inscription (Archontean) “Kaitor proditor amici” (“Kaitor, betrayer of a friend”).
* Inside: a less-well preserved body dressed in a breastplate with an embossed trident on it (symbol of St. Heschius Ban).
	* A trident of water breathing (new) lies next to him.
	* Under the body is a badly decomposed leather pouch w/ 3 tourmalines (100 gp)
	* A parchment scroll (Emperor commission of Kaitor’s as a kentarch, 50 gp to a historian)
	* A small parchment codex (the Expedition Notes of Kaitor)
		* Records some of Kaitor’s thoughts on the expedition.

Expedition Notes of Kaitor
* Written 234 years ago by Kaitor, cleric of St Heschius Ban, as a record of the expedition of Adrienic to recolonize Arden Vul.
	* It is more focused on interpersonal and notable details than being a comprehensive record, but it describes a lot of the expedition (last entry, following the escape from the Caves of Blood, lamenting Guvriel's behavior toward Lankios)
* Records candid assessments of the leadership of the expedition:
	* Adrienic, the new archon (a good administrator, but arrogant and stubborn)
	* Basil Junienos, his second in command (craven and weak; a functionary)
	* Tulliaros, polemarch of the 2nd Legion (Sheepshead rangers) (an excellent tactician, a sober voice of reason)
	* Maurikios Ligareon, taxiarch of the imperial tagmata (standoff-ish and superior, but a good disciplinarian)
	* Kallison, cleric of St Debellaton and chief clerical advisor to Adrienic (a political appointee, and a social bore; but powerful and well-loved by his saint)
	* Kyrenaios the chartoularios, chief administrator (the brains behind Adrienic)
	* Guvriel: wife of Adrienic (political), mage, unrequited love interest of Kaitor and Lankios.
	* Georgios and Hradulfus, of the Sacred Band (intimidating in their devotion to each other and the mission)
	* Lankios, polemarch, paladin, grown to be a great friend of Kaitor, completely smitten with Guvriel.
* Kaitor spends a fair amount of time mooning over Guivrel; his tone becomes more exasperated, and he wonders about the changes he claims to be witnessing in her (‘She is becoming mean. Why? Is it me?)

Guivrel's Sarcophagus
* Gisant: a woman in flowing robes; long hair held back by a circlet, clutching a staff.
* Inscription (Archontean): “Guivrel dulcissima amica” ( “Guivrel, most beloved friend”). 
* Inside: Guivrel’s desiccated corpse, with her golden hair still present.
	* A dagger with a trident (the symbol of Heschius Ban) inscribed on the hilt is buried in her chest.
	* Her right hand bears her signet ring (25 gp), the left bears the heqeti ring (new).  On her wrists are bracelets of defense (AC 7).
	* Beside her is her staff of striking (10 charges).

Backstory
* 250 years ago Emperor Phocion IV sent an expedition to re-establish a foothold in Arden Vul and locate sources of arcanum.
* Among the group were three friends, Lankios the paladin (1-6), Kaitor, a cleric of St. Heschius Ban, and Guivrel, a magic user.
	* Both Lankios and Kaitor were in love with Guivrel, who was married to the expedition’s commander, Adrienic, for political reasons.  She was a shrew political operator and ambitious.
	* In the course of their explorations, Guivrel obtained a heqeti ring, which twisted her mind in more chaotic and evil ways.
		* Pollitt the expedition sorcerer (6-140) found  ring in the Hall of Forty Pillars and gave to her as a gift.
	* She became more manipulative and ruthless, exploiting Lankios to her own ends.
* 230 years ago, the expedition foundered; Adrienic was slain in battle, along with most of his men, and a tiny rump of legionaries and administrators retreated to the region of the Hall of Forty Pillars.  Lankios was polemarch, one of the few remaining leaders.
* Kaitor, filled with unrequited love, watched with a sick heart as Guivrel continued to manipulate Lankios’s feelings in more insidious and cruel ways.
	* Finally Kaitor approached Guivrel and told her to cease her manipulations, but she laughed.  She said she planned to seduce Lankios and they would flee, abandoning the expedition, disgracing his vows and honor.  He'd serve her and they'd build their power elsewhere.  It would make a perfect bookend to the shit-show of the expedition.
	* Kaitor pulled his dagger and stabbed Guivrel through the heart, just as Lankios arrived to witness her death. He turned on Kaitor, who kept shouting that he had done it for Lankios’s good, to save him from treachery.
	* Lankios would not hear of it, and slew his erstwhile friend.
* Broken and unable to make sense of this tragedy, Lankios ordered his men to erect these tombs and leave a record of the sordid events, then wandered off into a growing haze of madness, cursed to linger until the judgement he could not make was given.

Judgement

* If either sarcophagus is opened, the other opens as well and and both emit clouds of vapor which coalesce into human forms (both speak Archontean).
	* Kaitor: “It was righteous!!”
	* Guivrel: “Treachery! Stabbed by a friend without cause!”
	* Kaitor: “She would have destroyed him, she would have cost him his life’s work, his honor. She told me so! Her death was for the greater good!”
	* Both: “I require judgment!  Pronounce judgement upon the guilty!”
* Neither spirit is truly sentient, speaking their stock phrases endlessly.
* Evidence
	* Here,  6-138 (note on Hector's body), SL3-19 (Guvriel's ring)

Puzzle: The spirits of Kaitor and Guivrel are restless and demand a judgment by the PCs.  The PCs’ judgment will have implications as follows:
* Kaitor is Guilty: the body of Guivrel fades to dust, but the spirit of Kaitor materializes into a powerful vengeful spirit (new) and attacks.
	* Bringing the signet of Guivrel to Lankios cures him of insanity, and he will live another 1-20 years.
* Guivrel is Guilty: Kaitor’s body decomposes instantly, but Guivrel’s springs forth as a banshee and attacks.
	* Her signet will be unrecoverable, and Lankios will stay cursed.
* Lankios (alone) is Guilty: neither spirit animates.
	* Bringing the signet to Lankios causes him 6 turns of sanity, during which he attempts to assault the PCs. After 6 turns he collapses into dust.
* Kaitor and Guivrel are Both Guilty: both of their bodies crumble into dust.
	* Bringing the signet to Lankios causes him to attack the PCs.
* Lankios and Kaitor are Guilty: Guivrel’s spirit laughs for 6 rounds and then dissipates.
	* Lankios will be found dead at 1-6. Heschius Ban curses all PCs.
* Lankios and Guivrel are Guilty: Guivrel turns into a banshee, but Kaitor materializes as a vengeful spirit (see new monsters) and helps to fight Guivrel.
	* When the combat is finished, Kaitor dematerializes. Bringing the signet to Lankios inflicts sanity and overwhelming remorse on him; he dies within 1-6 days.
* All are Guilty: a rumble of thunder is heard, and a flash of lightning shaped like a trident appears in the chamber (Heschius Ban). 
	* ll PCs receive a bless spell that is good for 2 weeks.
* No Judgment is Made: if the PCs refuse to judge, and do not loot the sarcophagi, nothing untoward occurs. If the PCs loot the tombs and leave without judging, they will be cursed and subject to a geas compelling them to return and judge.

* This chamber contains the sarcophagi of six Archontean warriors who were part of the first effort to colonize Arden Vul, some 2,100 years ago.
	* 10 half-columns ring the room (inanimate), carved in the same style as those in 5-15, still bearing much of the paint that once coated them.

### 5-18: Octagonal Hall

* This large octagonal chamber rises to a height of 35’ in its center.
	* Slabs of blue granite (5’x5’) sheath the walls, and doors line every wall.
		* The broken doors at 5-6f are bronze.
		* The rudishva iris door on the northeast wall is stone (opens when a silver rudishva identity plaque is touched to the accompanying panel).
		* The rest are iron-bound wood.
	* In the exact center of the room is a 15’-diameter raised dais (3’ off the ground).
		* In the center of the dais is a 5’-tall lump of weathered, mostly shapeless stone; its original subject is impossible to discern.
		* In front of this lump, facing the doors at 5-6f, is a newer, white marble statue.
			* A plaque reads ‘Adrienic, Governor of Arden Vul, 2759 AEP’
			* The human figure is dressed in a toga-like garment, with sandals, a torc, and a circlet.  One arm points forward, the other clasps a bundle of rods.
			* Originally inset with gemstones, but the stones are gone.
			* The statue has been badly vandalized with graffiti, excrement, etc. 
			* If the statue of Adrienic is moved (open doors), it reveals a vertical tomb, 3’ x 3’ x 6’, underneath it.
				* Adrienic’s shrouded, wrapped corpse.
				* A rudishva useful palm of size adjustment (3 charges, new)

				* An inscribed (Archontean) wax tablet (see below).

* GM Note: Adrienic was the leader of the doomed expedition sent by Emperor Phocion IV some 250 years ago to recolonize Arden Vul. The date on the plaque marks the death of Adrienic in the Cave of Blood (7-76).

Wax Tablet
* "Adrienic the ‘archon’ was brave enough. Seeking glory for the basileus, he led his entire command - five cohorts of the 2nd Legion (Sheepshead Rangers) and the 3rd cohort of the imperial tagmata (Able Ones) - down the chasm to confront the trolls, ignoring the warnings of his strategos and his polemarchs. There he died gloriously, along with all 500 legionaries. The veterans of the tagma fought a delaying action to cover the retreat of the survivors. But when ambushed by the old servants, with their ridiculous pseudo-king or thain, the retreat turned into a rout. The twinned warriors of the Sacred Band held the bridge against the horde while Tulliaros, polemarch of the Sheepshead Rangers, rallied the survivors. Eventually Sibillire brought down the bridge and surrounding chambers with her sorcery. The paired lovers were lost, and Maurikios, taxiarch of the 3rd cohort, was cut off with the remnants of the tagma. I, Lankios the polemarch, assumed command of the remnant of this accursed expedition and buried those whose bodies remained. Guivrel has been of no help, and Kaitor grows sullen. How will the basileus react to this disaster? I have turned to the strategos, Basil, as senior surviving officer. He will be ‘archon’."

* GM Notes: This valuable note explains what happened to the expedition of Adrienic.
	* Lankios still lives (see 1-6).
	* Maurikios Ligareon also lives, due to rudishva techno-sorcery; he calls himself Thegan White-Mane now (see 6-19).
	* For Guivrel and Kaitor, see 5-11.
	* For Basil Junienos, see 5-23
	* For Sibillire see 5-19
	* For the paired lovers, Georgios and Hradulfus, see 5-20.

## 5-19 to 5-24: Looted Archontean Tombs

* Originally designed for other purposes, Adrienic (see 5-18) made them the seat of the short-lived restoration of Archontean power in Arden Vul.
	* For about 20 years they were used as the administrative and political nerve center of the new colony.
	* When Adrienic’s folly led to the annihilation of the expedition, the remaining officers, recognizing they would have to abandon the Halls, chose to lay the corpses of the ranking members of the expedition to rest in these chambers.
* The original decorations are long gone. The walls are thus mostly bare, save for the occasional bit of graffiti.
	* On the interior wall of each chamber, opposite the entrance door, is a large message splashed in red paint naming those buried in the chamber.
	* The stone sarcophagi (1 or 2 per chamber) within have sides carved with images of Archontean legionaries in the classical style (dating to the golden age of Archontean rule in Arden Vul, that is, some 1,500 years ago).
		* The lids (when present) are new, with the name of the inhabitant chiseled in fine Archontean capital letters.
	* The chambers are littered with dust, rock chips, graffiti, bits of bone, fragments of leather and parchment, and broken bits of metal equipment.

* If PCs stop to read the graffiti, roll on the following table; some entries will only appear once:

Refers to the sorcerer Pollitt, who accompanied Adrienic’s expedition to the Halls but fled to 
pursue his own goals. His fate may be glimpsed at 6-137 and 6-139.

83-84
The goblins control access to the Sundered Span. Guess we shouldn’t have slain so many of 
them. Now we’re stuck.

A reference to the goblin caves (5-41 to 5-51) and the Sundered Span across the chasm (5-35)

85-86
Make Gog happy, and he’ll make you happy

Good advice about Gog, the lesser varumani (5-2)

87-88
Gog has a taste for beastman flesh, despite his so-called treaty

Another truism about Gog (5-2), potentially useful in winning Gog’s friendship

89-90
Grease the paws of that goblin, Killik, and doors will open for you

A reference to the willingness of Killik (5-46) to accept gifts

91-92
Don’t go too far east of the Troll Lift – we lost Grevius there.

A cryptic reference to the Sanctum (5-77 to 5-83)

93-94
The Inn of the Lost lies just below the Troll Lift. Ask for Thegan. He’s a good bloke.

Accurate (mostly) information about the Inn of the Lost, at 6-7 to 6-20

95-96
Tremarus kept messing with the damned gates, and kept summoning more undead. He’s joined them now.

A warning about the Obsidian Gates (5-6)

97-98
There must be a way around these damned Gates. Maybe if we go down a level, and then come up behind them?

Good advice, if hard to manage. Areas 6-166, 7-34 and 7-88 have tunnels that wend upwards to the Midnight Road area.

99-100
Arcanum, huh. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing!

A misguided fighter’s lament.

### 5-19: Tomb of Sibillire 

* Scrawled on the wall opposite the entrance (Archontean) “Sibillire, court wizard”.
	* Her sarcophagus lacks a lid and contains nothing valuable.
		* The sarcophagus may be shifted (lift gates), revealing a set of narrow stone steps that descend 20’ to an equally narrow tunnel leading north to 5-85a.

### 5-20: Georgios and Hradulfus

* Scrawled on the wall of this chamber (Archontean) “Georgios and Hradulfus, warriors of the Sacred Band.”
* A badly faded mural of two black-haired warriors fighting “trolls” (varumani) covers the northwest wall.
	* Fragments of two sarcophagi holding badly scorched bones, are all that remain of the pair.
	* GM: this pair of warrior-lovers sacrificed themselves so the survivors of Adrienic’s expedition could escape across the imperial bridge (now the Sundered Span, 5-35).

### 5-21: Tomb of Tulliaros the Polemarch

* Painted on wall of this tomb (Archontean): “Tulliaros, polemarch of II Scutarii.”
* The stone sarcophagus is intact, but empty.  Its lid lies against the north wall.
		* The lid depicts a simple legionary figure surrounded by the letters ‘T(u)ll(iaro)s P(ole)m(ar)chos’ (the letters in brackets are missing), and a crude sheep’s head (the symbol of the 2nd legion).
		* A clay tablet inside "Would that we had heeded his advice and the Cave of Blood had not come to pass.  We have no body to inter, but let these words acknowledge his wisdom and valor.  -- Lankios"
	* Although quite heavy, the sarcophagus lid would bring over 2,000 gp to imperial collectors in Narsileon or Archontos. 

* GM: Tulliaros was commander of the 5 cohorts of the 2nd legion of scutarii that provided the main military force for Adrienic’s expedition.
	* He was slain at the Cave of Blood (known today as the Troll Market – 7-76) by the varumani and his body was never recovered.
	* For his wisdom (as he had argued against Adrienic’s doomed strategy), Lankios erected an empty sarcophagus in his honor.
	* The troll thegn mummified Tulliaros’s head as a token of victory (located at 7-12).

### 5-22: Tomb of Kyrenaios the Chartoularios

* On the wall opposite the entrance are painted (Archontean): “Kyrenaios the Chartoularios.”
* The same name is inscribed on the side of the sarcophagus, the lid of which is now completely destroyed. 
	* A 2’-long, leathery, brown egg, swollen from within, lies in the sarcophagus.
		* If touched with any roughness, it explodes, coating all within 10 feet in putrescent matter. The smell increases encounter changes by 1, until thoroughly washed away.

* GM Note: Kyrenaios was the chief administrative officer of Adrienic’s expedition.

### 5-23: Tomb of Basil, 2nd Archon

* Across from the entrance is scrawled (Archontean): “Basil, archon after Adrienic. He lasted only a few days”.
* The mostly-intact lid to the sarcophagus rests against the northeast wall
	* It displays Basil’s name and a crude image of a portly man in a toga.
* Secret Door (southeast): high on the southeast wall is a 4’x4’ secret door to 5-12.
	* Difficult to spot (1 in 8), opens by pushing the door panel inward, then sliding left.
* A hidden compartment in floor (1 in 6 to find) hides a greasy leather bag.
	* Bracers of defense (AC 3), gauntlets of ogre power, 3 potions of water breathing, and 250 pp.

* GM Note: Basil Junienos was the senior surviving officer after the disaster of the Cave of Blood (now the Troll Market, 7-76) and the long retreat up the chasm.
	* Although Basil was a timid, entirely stupid man, Lankios dutifully made him archon after the death of Adrienic.  Basil died of a heart attack a few days later. 

### 5-24: Tomb of Kalliston the Priest

* Scrawled in red paint opposite the entrance (Archontean): “Kalliston, priest of St Debellaton. One of the good ones.”
	* Divine protection has kept Kalliston’s tomb unplundered.
* A narrow, worn sarcophagus is inscribed with ancient Archontean legionaries on its sides.
	* The lid, however, is new, and bears an image of a scythe (a symbol of Debellaton) and (Archontean): “Kalliston, beloved of Debellaton, fallen in battle.”
	* Inside: Kalliston’s bones; a flail +2; three 5”-tall basalt statuettes of the reaper (275 gp each); a lemon-yellow silk shroud with purple images of hoplite images and swords (a piece of silk from the imperial factories, worth 350 gp); and a silver and gold holy symbol of Debellaton (75 gp).
* A translucent, 5”-tall cloaked figure with a scythe hovers just above the sarcophagus.
	* If the sarcophagus is tampered with, the image grows to 9’ tall and shouts menacingly (Archontean), “Lord Debellaton commands that you let his servant rest!”
	* Further tampering brings a curse from Debellaton on all in the chamber.

* GM Note: Kalliston, a senior priest of Debellaton, was the chief clerical advisor to Adrienic.

## Level 5: 25 - 45

### 5-25: Octagonal Hall of Justice

* A large, 35’-tall, octagonal chamber lies behind the formidable bronze doors at 5-6e (see text for how to open these doors). 
	* Similar to 5-18, but in far better condition, lacking the trash of areas 5-18 to 5-24.
	* A thick carpet of dust covers the floor of the room.
	* The ceiling is flaking badly, but was once painted gold.
	* A 15’-diameter dais (3’ tall) occupies the center of the room.
		* A heavy oak chair – a seat of justice – sits on the dais facing the doors at 5-6e. 
			* Magnificent and over-sized, as if for an 8’-tall person, beautifully carved with floral motifs on the armrests and legs, and a gilt hoplite helmet on the backrest.
			* The chair was the archon’s chair, or seat of justice, for Adrienic during the short-lived Archontean reoccupation of the Halls that ended 234 years ago
			* 4500 gp if disassembled correctly (55 lbs, bulky, 4d6 under INT to not break it) and sold to an Archontean noble or official).
	* Six oak desks and desk-chairs occupy the northwest, southwest, and southeast portions of the chamber. 
		* Each desk has 3 drawers, but were systematically emptied by the Archonteans when they fled.
			* A piece of parchment is stuck to one desktop with a dagger
				* (Archontean) “The Shining Empire may have departed today, but it shall return. I, Lankios the polemarch, acting archon of Arden Vul, swear it!” (dated 2759 AEP).
				* A carved ivory coffer sits atop a desk (395 gp, empty).
					* Ancient, dating to the very earliest days of the Archontean Empire (55 AEP, >2,900 years ago).  Its carvings are quite different from those in the mature, realistic style elsewhere in the halls; they depict squat, ovoid humans with huge eyes and gaping mouths, wielding spears against lizards.
					* Locked, trapped (-5% to spot) with a dusting of hallucinatory spores (save vs poison or believe the coffer is cursed and must be shunned, and that they will die in 1d2 days; both false).
	* Doors occupy every face of the octagon: 6 single doors, 2 double (the entry, and the stone doors opposite the entry).
		* All but one are of the pebbled, greasy granite as the halls and chambers.
		* The door to 5-31 is an 8’-diameter, plasteel rudishva iris door set in the surrounding stone
			* Opens to pale green, pink, orange, silver or yellow identity plaques.
		* Listeners at any door marked 5-27 hear wordless moaning and scratching. 

### 5-26: Archontean Officers’ Quarters

* The door to this chamber can only be opened if the last lever in 5-28 is pulled.
* The chamber is 15’ tall and decorated with a pale-blue wash of paint on all surfaces.
	* Eight rotting wood-and-canvas camp beds, eight wooden chests, and four wooden armoires fill the chamber.
		* The canvas of the camp beds is too far gone to be usable, and the chests and armoires have mostly been cleared of valuables.
			* 2-4 Turns of searching the rubbish in the containers turns up: 
				* A battered but usable set of Sacred Band banded mail
					* (weighs 10 lb less than usual, quite distinctive and will bring unpleasant questioning from any current members of the Sacred Band, the armor was Georgios’s – see 5-20)
				* A beautiful, yellow-and-purple silk archon’s tunic (110 gp)
				* A Sortian baculus +1, imbued with detect magic (new)
				* A small octavo codex with a unique epic poem composed by Adrienic himself and entitled the Adrieniad (books).

### 5-27: Collapsed Stairwells

* The stone doors to each of these three areas are locked and stuck.
	* Opened by either activating via lever in 5-28 (opens all three at once, releasing their inhabitants) or picking locks then open doors to force one open.
* Each of the three areas has a narrow, 6’ corridor that extends 8’, ending in a cave-in.
	* The beginnings of stairs leading down are visible amid the rubble.
	* Each area holds a wight, imprisoned here by Kalliston (5-24) before the great defeat at the Cave of Blood (7-76).

3 wights: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 4+3; HP 33, 29, 27; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic needed to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### 5-28: Niche of the Levers

* The undecorated, stone double-doors possess 1”-diameter, 9”-deep keyholes.
	* Inserting rods of appropriate diameter, one silver and one gold, open the doors.
* The space beyond is a 4’-deep niche, on the floor of which sit six heavy steel levers.
	* Southeastern lever: opens all three sets of doors to 5-27, as does the door to 5-29.
	* Northwestern lever: opens all three sets of doors to 5-27, as does the door to 5-26.
	* The other four levers grind when pulled, but do nothing.

### 5-29: Treasure Chamber

* Pulling the first lever in area 5-28 is the only way to open the door to this chamber.
* The walls and ceiling of this 10’-tall chamber are bright with paint (gilt for the ceiling).
	* The walls depict Archontean imperial imagery in modern (250 years old) style.
		* Southwest: a band of legionaries marching in close formation, wearing segmented banded mail and brandishing spears and gladii.
		* Northeast: a distinguished, bearded man in a yellow tunic sits in a large wooden chair (matching the one in 5-25), as two men debate before him.
		* Northwest: an enormous, 10’-tall painting of the torso and head of Adrienic, complete with oiled, ringleted hair, hawk nose, glittering black eyes, and a stern expression.
* A large stone table in the center of the room is piled high with valuables.
	* 2 large jade candlesticks (50 gp each)
	* A 25-lb jade statuette of a bear with opals for eyes (1,550 gp)
	* A hammered gold ceremonial headdress set with lapis and colored glass (250 gp, 3’ tall, 8 lb)
	* Two small (3’x5’) silk carpets (200 gp each)
	* A set of six delicate crystal goblets (50 gp each)
	* A solid gold hoplite helmet (375 gp, useless in combat)
	* An iron key to area SL8-1
	* A rosewood box with two tears of Kauket (new)
	* A token of Arden (av items) wrapped in silk
	* An ever-full inkwell (new)
	* A set of the eyes of Pol (new).
* Beneath it are two locked wooden chests.
	* Chest #1: two images burned in the lid via pyrography: a yellow hoplite helmet and a white sheep’s head (the sign of the 2nd Legion, five cohorts of which were annihilated below).
		* The lock is smashed and the chest empty.
	* Chest #2 (locked): same two images burned into it.
		* 20,000 sp in neat stacks (one of the pay chests of the Sheepshead Rangers (2nd Legion)).
* On an armor rack next to the table is a gilded, impressive-looking suit.
	* Cursed armor of arrow attraction (chain mail; new).
* Secret Door (northwest): difficult to locate (1 in 8), pushes open, but stuck.

* GM Note: This chamber served as the treasury for the doomed Archontean expedition to the Halls led by Adrienic (see 5-18).
	* After the loss of nearly the entire force, the survivors retreated with what they could take; this chamber contains the valuables that they could not take. 

### 5-30: Secret Rudishva Chamber

* The narrow corridor and chamber beyond are clad in black granite sheathing, with the corners rendered smooth so it feels more like a tube than a corridor.
* The chamber is 10’ tall and spotlessly free of dust and other debris.
	* In the center is a white console 4’ tall with a set of buttons with glyphs on them and a cracked and darkened glass screen.
		* It lacks power and is useless.
	* Attached to the front of the console is an envelope of a flexible plastic
		* Inside are pale green, orange and pink rudishva identity plaques.

### 5-31: Lesser Rudishva Teleportation Hall

* The 8' iris door to this chamber opens when a pale green, pink, orange, silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque is held to the accompanying panel. 
* Beyond the door, stairs descend 25’ to a set of three small, semi-oval chambers.
	* The corridor and the ‘rooms’ have no sharp corners, are spotlessly clean, and are sheathed in black granite.
	* In each rooms is a 5’-diameter circle of silvery material inset in the floor.
		* A 10”x10” square of the same material is affixed to the wall. Each square has a different rune etched into the silvery material.
		* Standing on a circle and touching the adjacent silvery square; teleports one to  the appropriate location is instantaneous. 

Teleport Nodes:

	* Spiders may be encountered here just as in that location. 
		* d6: 2 huge spiders (1), 3 huge spiders (2), 4 huge spiders (3), 1 giant spider (4), 1 giant spider and 2 huge spiders (5), the whole nest! (6)

huge or giant spiders: see 3-37 for number and stats.

1 giant spider: SZ L; AL CE; AC 4; MV 30’, 120’ in web; HD 4+4; HP 32, 29, 25; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: poison.

### 5-33: Chasm Cephalopod Lair, w/ Tunnel up to 4-87

	* Ten of the creatures dwell here, but only 4 are present at any one time. 
	* Amid some polished bones on the floor is a rucksack.
		* Inside: a jade cup of life restoration (new) and a useful note and map written on the back of an empty spell-scroll (see below).
* An opening 15’ up on the north wall leads to a tunnel that snakes gradually upwards about 100’ to 4-87.

10 small chasm cephalopods (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 2; HP 15, 14, 14, 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 11, 8; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-3/1-3/1-4; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

Note (Thorcin)
* “We entered the halls once the imperials had fled, for Eadred had good information about an unlooted tomb, of a certain Sethu, one of the bird-god’s priests. It was said to be northwest of the Imperial Span, along the chasm face. So, passing through the pyramid, we dispatched some brigands and made our way down the priests’ so-called hidden stair to the grotto by the Hall of Forty Pillars. We proceeded east to the Imperial Span, only to find it had fallen and enemies lurking on the north side. Gyth suggested returning to the public chambers and using ropes to scale down the cliff face. As we proceeded, Gyth located an obscured circular portal just opposite the nobles’ tombs. We entered eagerly, and Eadred and Mirko ran forward; but I knew it was a mistake, for the decoration was not that of the ibis lords. A giant skeleton confronted us, and Eadred and Mirko fell. Gyth and I retreated, and descended another 80’. Finally we found the tomb of Sethu, where it was predicted – northeast of the Span, and east and below the tomb where Eadred and Mirko fell. Gyth’s sharp eyes noticed this cave across the chasm, and it seemed a safe place to rest. We used my magicks to cross the chasm and I prepared to rest. Gyth amused himself taking bowshots at some floating things. When I awake we will complete our quest! 

* GM Note: The rolled-up note refers to the following locations: the tomb of Sethu (areas 5-57 to 5-62); the Imperial Span, now known as the Sundered Span (5-35); the pyramid (areas AV-15, UP-1, and 3-1); the hidden stair (3-12); the grotto (5-2); the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6); the circular portal and tomb with giant skeleton (3-39); and the chasm (3-38 or 5-34). The floating things are chasm cephalopods. 

### 5-34: Great Chasm

* One of the iconic features of the Halls, this massive fissure extends through most of the dungeon levels and provides a sure, if difficult, means of vertical navigation of the Halls.
	* The fissure is generally shaped like a triangular prism, with its apex about 50’ above Level 2, and extends downward 1,600’ through the Halls until it levels out at the floor of the great chasm (9-1).
* The chasm is quite wide on this level, and is subject to more varied potential encounters.
	* Key features of the chasm include the first waterfall (5-2a) which renders an area 50’ in diameter around it both humid and noisy, the Sundered Span (5-35), and the upper section of the Troll Lift (5-54).
	* The moisture from the waterfalls ensures that the walls of the chasm are lined with creepers, vines, lichen mats, and so forth.
* Secret Door (to 5-40): difficult to locate (1 in 8), concealed by a heavy growth of creepers and camouflaged to look like natural stone.  It can only be opened by force. 
	* The second secret door, to 5-40 proper, is easy to locate (1 in 4), stuck (open doors).
* Concealed door (to 5-57): A curtain of hanging creepers conceals the entrance to Sethu’s tomb.
	* Originally a plaster plug textured to look like stone obscured the entrance, but a 6’-diameter hole has been cut in the plaster, allowing access to the inquisitive.

### 5-35: The Sundered Span

* This ancient bridge dates to the heqeti period and is an iconic location within Arden Vul.
	* For centuries it was known as the Imperial Span.
	* In 2759 AEP, Sibillire the mage (5-19) sundered the bridge in a desperate attempt to protect the fleeing remnant of the Archontean expeditionary force from the victorious varumani.
* The bridge is a 10’-wide, gently curved, solid stone span that lacks its central 15’, which is spanned by a rickey 3' wide plank of wood.
	* The remaining pieces are rather weak and susceptible to crumbling, as well as slick with moisture from the waterfall (5-2a).
		* The sound from the waterfall increases chances for surprise while in the chasm.
	* The troll thegn (7-30) ordered the plank laid across the missing span.

### 5-36: Tomb of Muirasso, False Burial Chamber

* This complex holds the tomb of Muirasso, one of the archons of Arden Vul in antiquity.
* This first chamber is the false tomb, decorated in a gaudy Thothian scheme, with bright cerulean walls.
	* Magic Mouth: on entry, a magic mouth placed on the statues booms forth in stentorian tones (Mithric) “You have found me. Let me lie!”
	* East wall: a large fresco of seven administrators of Arden Vul flanking Muirasso, all dressed in orange ceremonial Thothian garb.  Large gold letters read (Mithric) ‘Muirasso, Archon of Arden Vul’.
		* Crammed against the east wall is a pile of impressive looking gilt furniture (actually golden paint).
	* North and south walls: each have two half-column statues of priests of Thoth, covered in flaking gold paint.
		* Three of the four statues are fixed to the wall; one is not.
			* Shifting it reveals a concealed door to 5-37.
* A 6’-diameter column of shimmering air occupies the center of the room, in which floats a mummified human body.
	* It wears orange silk, a golden ceremonial helmet (bronze w/ gold veneer, 15 gp), and a green stone necklace (apparently jade, actually just worthless stone).  It holds an iron ankh in its crossed hands.
	* The corpse remains levitating in the column until the golden helmet is removed.
		* The body crashes to the floor, and the statues shout “You should have let me lie!” as poison gas pours from their mouths, filling the chamber in 1 round (save vs poison at +1 or die, 1d4 per round on success).  The gas dissipates in 3 hours, and the trap resets in 3 hours.

### 5-37: Tomb of Muirasso: Entrance

* The corridor from 5-36 is choked with cobwebs, dust and dirt; untraversed it in well over a millennium.
* This chamber is decorated simply, with a 10’-diameter circle of marble in its center and a painted frieze stretching around the upper edge of the walls.
	* The frieze repeats the phrase (Mithric): “Knowledge of Thoth and His Mysteries Reveals the Way.”
	* Around the circle in the center of the room are four 6’-tall, 3’-square blocks of granite carved carved to represent the classic image of the ‘scribe’, with knees bent to the chest.
		* On the folded knees of each scribe is a different object (also stone).
		* Each block carries an inscription in Mithric and boasts an 8”-square open hole.
			* If the correct item is deposited into the hole, a magical effect is produced.
			* Manipulation of the scribes is also the only way to progress further into the tomb (by manipulating either scribe 3 or 4).
		* First Scribe: torch, “Thoth consumes Light.”
			* Anyone who deposits a light source (torch, lantern, continual light rock, etc.) must save vs. spells at -2 or be permanently blinded.
			* It is untrue that Thoth consumes light (he sheds light on knowledge).
		* Second Scribe: a small human figurine, “Thoth Consumes the Ka.”
			* Anyone who deposits an intimate object (hair, nails, a piece of personal clothing, etc.) must save vs petrification at -2 or die.
			* Anyone with knowledge of his cult would know Thoth is not a death god.
		* Third Scribe: a scroll, “Thoth consumes Sorcerous Wisdom.”
			* Deposit a scroll with any spells and it burns away.  A loud ‘click’ is heard as the door to 5-38 opens.
			* Although Thoth does impart wisdom, he avariciously acquires it.
		* Fourth Scribe: a wand, “Thoth Consumes Magic.”
			* Deposit a magic item and it is disenchanted.  A loud click is heard as the door to 5-38 opens.
			* Thoth is the source of magic, but also avariciously collects it.

### 5-38: Tomb of Muirasso: Main Tomb

* The door to this chamber is stone and magically locked.
	* Properly manipulating scribe # 3 or #4 in area 5-37 is the only way to open it.
* The interior of the chamber is decorated sumptuously with painted bas-reliefs.
	* Servants carry incense, cloth, precious stones, ivory, etc towards a panel of seven priests (along the southwest wall), the largest of whom is labeled ‘Muirasso’.
* Three sarcophagi, each 6’ long, 3’ wide, and 4’ tall, rest in the center of the chamber.
	* Muirasso’s sarcophagus (southeastern) is the least well decorated, with only a thinly etched sketch of a scarab beetle on its lid.
		* The following curse repeats (secret tongue of Thoth) around the edge of the lid: “Those who disturb the Archon’s Rest will Become Bones and Dust.”
		* 6,936 ancient copper bits, 2,564 ancient silver pennies, a glowing long sword (false dweomer: no actual bonus), a stoppered jug of purple mist (new), and two alabaster flasks filled with a bright blue liquid (potions of poison). 
	* The central and northwestern sarcophagi are trapped.
		* The lids are richly carved to depict realistic (if stylized) faces, bodies, scarabs, and rods of authority (gold gilt and lapis inlay is worth 50 gp each). 
		* If the lid is disturbed, it releases a sickly green gas that quickly fills the room.
			* The gas heals undead 2 hp / round (doesn't restore the slain) and prevents turning.
			* The gas is emitted from an open canopic jar (1000 gp to a necromancer). Its crocodile-head lid lies beside it; replacing it stops the gas.  The gas is inexhaustible, but only within this tomb complex.
	* If the lids of any of the three sarcophagi are disturbed, undead servitors free themselves from the bas-reliefs on the walls (2 per round until 12) and attack, and Muirasso himself will rise from his sarcophagus.
* Secret Door (southwest): locked (key long gone, pick or batter down).

12 undead servitors (zombies): SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 14, 14, 12, 12, 11(x3), 10(x3), 9, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special: always strike last.

Muirasso, wight: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 4+3; HP 33; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic needed to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

		* Secret Door (southeast, to 5-40, locked): easy to find (1 in 4)

### 5-40: Tomb of Muirasso: Treasury

* Muirasso’s treasure is piled in this low-ceilinged chamber (6’ tall).
	* The walls rough and undecorated.
	* Three stone chests lie in the center of the room.
		* Each chests is trapped with a poison needle (save vs poison or die).
		* Chest 1: four alabaster and gold canopic jars (200 gp each).
			* One contains a huge azurite (300 gp), another contains a pair of keys to the hematite doors (3-177).  Each of the other two holds 2 scrolls (rope trick, invisibility 10’ radius, Pol’s inner eye (new), and enchanted weapon).
		* Chest 2: mace of Muirasso (new), ring of protection +1, amulet of courage (new), rod of turning (20 charges, new).
		* Chest 3: eight glass potion flasks (2x extra healing, clairvoyance, clairaudience, frost giant strength, human control, deafening light (new), and dispelling (new).
	* Four rotted leather sacks beside the chests.
		* 25,387 ancient copper bits; 13,902 ancient silver pennies; 7,477 ancient gold solidi; and 737 ancient octagonal platinum coins.
	* Lined up along the southwest wall are 20 solid gold shabti figurines (each 10” tall).
		* Various poses (carrying goods, hunting, fishing, etc; 1,750 gp each, 20 lb).
* Secret Door (northeast): easy to find (1 in 4), pushes open (stuck).
* Secret Door (northeast, into the chasm)
	* Easy to find from this side (1 in 4), swings open when a wall button is pressed.
	* It's difficult to locate (1 in 8) from chasm-side, concealed by a heavy growth of creepers and camouflaged to look like natural stone.  Can only be forced from here.

### 5-41: Broken Hall

* This hall was once a near mirror image of the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6), but suffered catastrophic damage over the millennia. 
* A 20’ arch leading to a gloomy, arched (but pillar-less) ruin of heqeti-era pebbled stonework.
	* Twenty feet into the hall, the ceiling has collapsed, blocking further passage.
	* An aura of brooding menace prevails, as the Hall is silent, clammy, and oppressive. 
	* The hall is remarkably free of dust and dirt, due to the passage of the goblins from 5-43.
* Northeast is a short passageway ending in another cave-in.
	* It is filled with cobwebs, with the dried husk of a goblin; but no spiders are present.
* A narrow, difficult to locate, slit in the rubble near the cave-in leads to 5-42. 
* A 8’-diameter hole in the pavement leads to a steeply sloping mound of rubble.
	* The ramp descends 40’ at a 45-degree angle (+1x difficult terrain) to 5-43.
	* At the foot of the mound is a barrier of interwoven sticks (see 5-43).

### 5-42: Beetles, Bodies, and Doors to a Vault (SL6-55a) 

* This area is accessed by a narrow passage through the rubble from 5-41.
* A pair of huge bronze doors (15’ tall) are featureless, save for a circular inset (10” in diameter and 1” deep) on the left door.
	* The locking system was created by the priesthood of Set in antiquity.  Behind the doors, stairs lead down 300’ to the hidden Archontean vault designed to hold rudishva artifacts (SL6-55, via SL6-55A).
	* Placing a 10”-diameter golden scarab beetle into the inset opens the doors for 6 hours.  Afterward, the scarab flies back to the stone beetle and the door close.
		* The doors can be spiked open.
* Before the doors sits an enormous stone scarab beetle (8’ long, 4’ wide, 3’ tall), with inlaid jade and lapis (150 gp) to accentuate the pattern.
	* Its back contains twenty-five round inset holes (twenty-four are 2” in diameter, the one closest to the eyes of the stone beetle is 5” in diameter).
		* Seventeen of the small insets are filled with gold and ivory miniature versions of the larger beetle; the other seven small insets and the 5” one, are empty. 
	* It's mandibles are closed.
		* When all the insets are filled, they open, revealing the 10" golden scarab key.
	* Splayed around the enormous stone beetle are corpses of three goblins and one completely desiccated human clad in the red robes of the cult of Set.
		* Goblins: 3d12 sp, rusty short sword, battered shield.
		* Priest of Set: pouch holding a desiccated ball of dung 6” in diameter; inside is the dormant medium scarab.
		* The observant may note (from the entrance) 7 coin-sized gold objects (small gold scarab beetles) around the corpses.
* Golden Scarabs
	* If not at rest in the insets of the great stone scarab (those on the ground or removed from it), they will animate and attack, either in 1d3 Turns (small scarab) or 1d3 hours (large scarab) if people are round, or if anyone touches the bronze doors.
		* If completely embedded in a ball of dung, a scarab won't animate.
		* Dispel magic permanently neutralizes 1d3+3 beetles per casting.
	* Value: small (150 gp), medium (500 gp), large (2000 gp).
		* 1/3rd value if battered from combat.

### 5-43: Goblin Guardpost

	* It takes a turn to figure out how to navigate the tricky path through the wicket.
	* The wicket is quite damp and unlikely to catch fire.
* The room is cool and damp.
	* A dozen goblins led by a captain are here at all times.
		* They expect to parlay, but will respond with violence if need be.

## Level 5: 46 - 66

### 5-46: Goblin Commander

* This area is a combination of natural caves and ancient (heqeti) worked stone.
	* The door to 5-52, made of greasy, pebbled stone, is half covered by a pile of debris.
		* Atop it is a spear shaft with a wood scrap scrawled (goblin) “No go! Bad Juju!”
		* In the center of the door is carved a 2’-square, hideous, amphibian-esque face.
			* Two vertical, almond-shaped eyes glare forth over a slit nose and a wide, but tightly-shut, mouth.
		* Four 2”-square indentations in the stone are located above and below the face.
			* The indentations are covered with grime.  Cleaning them reveals that each contains a smaller carving.  Clockwise from upper left:
				* 1) four heqeti hoppers in a line, each with a spear 
				* 2) a single heqeti hopper pointing his spear directly at the viewer
				* 3) three heqeti hoppers arranged in a triangle, spearing a human
				* 4) two heqeti hoppers carry a dead varumani with their two spears.
			* Touching the small carvings in order causes the closed mouth of the main carving to grind open, revealing an obvious latch for the door.
				* The wrong combination, or violence to the door, summons a dreadful keqemander demon (new) to 5-52 (see explanation at 5-52).
				* The proper sequence is as follows: 4-3-2-1.
					* A declining sequence of the number of heqeti in the image. 
	* The chamber is the residence of Killik, one of the trusted lieutenants of Weskenim, the Goblin king (SL4-22).
		* He calls himself the “Big Boss of the Wet Caves” and spends most of his time lounging on his ‘throne,’ an ancient wooden armchair hung with bones, placed atop a mound of rubble in front of the door to 5-52.
			* Killik’s hoard is in a leather sack hidden in the rubble mound.
				* 391 cp; 4,178 sp; 553 gp; a 1" diameter wooden rod coated in silver (a key for 5-6e or 5-6f); one bracer from a set of bracers of haste (new; the other bracer is in 3-225); a rudishva lesser power supply.
		* Twelve goblin warriors accompany Killik.
	* Other decorations of the room:
		* A tattered brown cloth on which is painted a grinning goblin face
		* Half-a-dozen glow-beetle innards hang from the walls
		* A huge skull of a lizard, gaudily painted and festooned with feathers

12 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 6, 5(x3), 4(x3), 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

Killik, goblin ‘chief’ (as gnoll): SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 14; #AT 1; Dmg 3-9 (morning star +1). Possessions: morning star +1.
* He wears a wooden, man-sized ring (a ring of higher purpose, new) on a thong around his neck (he is ignorant of its power, just that it's "magic").
* Smart and ambitious, proud of his role as the overseer of King Weskenim’s operations in this important area of the middle halls.
	* Accustomed to negotiating with travelers.  He expects a small ‘gift’ from travelers who wish to travel between 5-2 and 5-35 (1-10 gp per person).
	* For all of his gregariousness, he expects to be treated with respect.
* Killik has been charmed by the vampire, Cinna Minux (7-122), who occasionally visits him to pump the goblin for information. 
* He can little information about the surrounding regions.
	* He knows Gog and talks respectfully of him (5-2).
	* He also knows Riglon the varumani (5-54) and the operation of the Troll Lift
		* He is more circumspect about Riglon than Gog, considering the troll thegn and his operatives to be bullies.
	* If asked about the door to 5-52, he attempts to dissuade friendly visitors from the ‘certain doom’ that lies behind that door.
		* Pressed, he says ‘there is a bad monster in there who eats everyone. Just last month a smarty-pants dwarf with servants arrived with gifts for Killik. We feasted for a long time, but then the dwarf grew curious about our door. Killik told him not to go in, but he insisted. Somehow, he knew the trick! Killik doesn’t know the trick, but he has heard the cries of those who do. (shudder) Killik tried to prevent him, but the dwarf did not listen. And he never returned! So, you see, friends of Killik should not go in!’
			* GM: Jasper Malachite, a dwarven adventurer slain in area 5-52.

### 5-47: New Goblins in an Old Room

* A crumbling, ancient hall marked by greasy, pebbled stonework.
	* The south and west sides are rough, the former ceiling and walls having collapsed.
	* The east and north still show features of the ancient stone-work.
	* Broken but identifiable pavement covers the eastern half of the room.
		* Clearing the dust and dirt (1/4 inch of it) reveals a fragmentary mosaic depicting a bipedal form with webbed fingers and toes, and an enormous maw.
* More goblins under Killik’s command inhabit the rom.
	* They have rigged several traps in the narrow tunnel leading from 5-48.
		* Falling block (X) (just inside the entrance to 5-47 from 5-48): a trip-wire runs an inch above the floor (50% per person to trip it) releases a stone block on a chain to sweep down, hitting 1d3 people for 3d6.
		* Noise (T): goblin witch doctors (SL4-12) cast Frigg’s flatulence (new) on a smiley face painted halfway down the corridor between 5-47 and 5-48.  A loud ‘raspberry’ echoes down the corridor if anyone passes within 5' of it. 

12 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 6, 5(x3), 4(x3), 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

### 5-48: Broken Hall

* This formerly grand hall leading to the Sundered Span (5-35) has fallen into decrepitude.
	* Its barrel-vaulted ceiling is crumbling, its radiating passages have collapsed, and its statuary has worn down to mostly-shapeless lumps.  The stonework is ancient, pebbled, and slightly greasy.
	* Several score large toads inhabit the chamber (as in 5-6, but none are transformed adventurers). 
	* Along the southeast wall stand four 8’-tall statues of shapeless bipeds, with all distinguishing racial or personal features worn away by time.
		* Each carries an equally shapeless weapon (treat as clubs).
		* They animate when 5-48 is entered, but don't pursue down the tunnel to 5-47, or approach within 30’ of the Sundered Span (5-35), returning to their posts.
			* Seasoned travelers know to rush between 5-35 and 5-47, thereby avoiding any threat. 
* (10%) encounter intelligent denizens on their way to or from the Sundered Span:

4 animated, shapeless statues (treat as Archontean animated constructs – see new monsters): SZ L; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 44, 40, 39, 38; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; immune to fire, cold, electricity, and mind-affecting magic; slashing weapons do ½ damage.

GM’s choice

### 5-51: Curving Tunnel Down to SL4-1

* This steeply twisting tunnel leads down 100’ to the Goblin Warrens (SL4-1).
	* The tunnel is natural, but a well-worn path has been beaten into the rock by countless feet.

### 5-52: Ancient Heqeti Vault 

* Trapped Door: The door from 5-46 can only be opened if the puzzle (at 5-46) is solved.
* The chamber was a central hall during the period of heqeti domination of these regions. 
	* The ceiling is 25’ tall, and the walls are grimy, pebbled, greasy, and streaked with alternating bands of bands of color (ruined frescoes) and reddish brown (blood).
	* Footprints of humanoids are visible in the dust, as are prints of a giant, 3-toed being (a keqemander).
	* Headless, broken statuary of squat, thick-legged humanoid beings (heqeti hoppers) lines both walls, badly worn with age and vandalism.
		* The heads are stacked in a pile in 5-52a.
	* A plinth stands in the northeastern end.
		* If the door's puzzle was mishandled, a keqemander demon squats on the plinth.
			* Its contract requires it to wait 17 days from summoning and slay all non-heqeti who enter.
			* 25% chance it is still be present, following the slaughter of a prior intruder.
			* After 17 days it is free to return to the abyss, but might (15%)  detour, either teleporting to 5-46 to slaughter Killik and his goblins (50%), or  venturing down the tunnel at 5-52b (50%) to the chasm floor (via 9-35). 
	* Snapped and broken bones of a variety of types litter the floor.
		* Among the broken bones is the still-enfleshed corpse of the demon’s most recent victim, the dwarf Jasper Malachite, slain here about a week ago.
			* Jasper’s clansman, Utor Malachite, is searching for his remains (see 7-76).
			* Leather pouch (113 gp, 57 sp), a set of fine lockpicks (40 gp), an oily soapstone statuette of a salamander (75 gp); and Jasper’s dwarven life-stone (inert, carved with the symbols of clan Malachite).
		* The keqemander has accrued a substantial pile of loot over the centuries, more through boredom and success in battle than any love of wealth:
			* 15,492 ancient silver pennies, 6,859 ancient gold solidi
			* Six painted glass cups with gilt and lapis (125 gp each)
			* A beautiful silk carpet depicting a scene of mysteries from the temple of Horus (350 gp)
			* A golden ceremonial helmet (125 gp)
			* A scroll (wizard’s cache, Daemon’s shadow)
			* 2 potions of healing; a potion of diminution; a potion of flying

### 5-52b: Tunnel Down to 9-35

* Amid the rubble of a collapsed heqeti-era side chamber a broad (7’ diameter) tunnel heads south, snaking downward some 1,100’ before ending up in area 9-35, just off the chasm floor.
	* Mostly natural, with sections of worked corridors and stair segments, all with the pebbled and slightly oily texture of heqeti construction.

### 5-53: Landing and Statue

* At the northeastern side of the Sundered Span (5-35) is an ancient chamber sheathed in 8’x8’ limestone blocks of great antiquity.
	* An imposing statue of a varumani wearing chain mail and armed with a huge mattock stands on a plinth.
		* The statue is incredibly lifelike; indeed (it's the petrified form of one of the troll thegn’s housecarls (see 7-29) who fell out of favor with his lord).
			* If unpetrified, Iklor the true varumani is grateful and offers to help against the troll thegn.
		* The plinth is considerably older, with writhing half-round figures of strange bipeds, troll-like figures (varumani), and amphibian beings. The art style is dates back to the wars of the rudishva against the heqeti.
		* Draped on top of the varumani statue: a string of goblin ears, a wax candle with an arrow stuck through it, a blotch of black paint, and a bit of graffiti.

### 5-54: Stone Seat

* An ancient chamber dating to the rudishva period.
	* The floor is composed of 10’-square flagstones, many cracked, pitted, and scorched.
	* The walls are sheathed in stone blocks worn smooth by age and countless hands (some few traces of paint and incisions may be detected).
	* A massive stone chair, 5’ wide and deep with a seat that rises 4’ above the chamber floor.  Both the back and seat of the chair bear deep scoring and scratching marks.
		* Like its companions at 3-52 and 9-9, this great chair was originally used for magical clairvoyance within the Halls, but the sigils on the seat that operated those functions have been destroyed.
		* Only by locating another iteration of the correct glyph (the glyph of ‘Sight’) and tracing it can the chair to be reactivated. A still-visible rudishva glyph of sight may be found at area 3-52.
* The chair now serves as the symbol and literal seat of authority of Riglon, vice-overseer of the Troll Lift.
	* Riglon is fairly lazy, and prefers to recline here in the chair, watching his minions work the lift at 5-55.
	* He and his mates have a keg of Hak’s mushroom ale (7-94), two carcasses of large lizards hanging from hooks driven into the walls, a sack of dried mushrooms and fruit, a second sack filled with 1,503 sp.

		* A wand of fire that Riglon confiscated some weeks ago (22 charges remaining).
* If approaching lights are spotted across the Sundered Span (3-35), the entire group (i.e., Riglon, his goblins, and his minions from 5-55) will be waiting to parlay.
	* If approached without light or from the east, 25% Riglon or one of his goblins will hear them coming.
	* If intruders manage to arrive undetected, Riglon leaps from his chair, shouts for his minions from 5-55, and then commands (in Varumani) the intruders to halt and offer proper obeisance to the troll thegn’s vice-overseer.
* Those wishing to use the Troll Lift to pass to Level 6 must negotiate with Riglon.
	* The official tariff set by the troll thegn is 1 gp per leg for delivery from 5-55 to 6-3.
		* Riglon attempts to charge neophytes 2 gp per leg and can be haggled down to 1.5 gp per leg.
	* This fee must be paid in advance each time one wishes to use the lift. 
* 1-in-6 chance another other group is present, negotiating for travel on the Lift.

* Riglon has been charmed by the vampire, Cinna Minux (7-122), who occasionally visits him to pump him for information and rumors.
* If Riglon likes the PCs, 25% chance he reminds them they need a passport to visit the troll thegn’s court.
	* 33% chance that he has an extra passport he's willing to sell (50 gp per person in the party).

He is a formidable warrior, but does not much like Riglon and will only assist him 50% of the time. 

10
Either a party of NPC adventurers (50%) or a magic user and flunkies (50%) traveling to the Inn of the Lost (areas 6-7 to 6-20). Either group will aid the PCs in a fight, but will blame the PCs for Riglon’s death when and if necessary. Select group from NPC appendix

### 5-55: Upper Troll Lift, leading down to area 6-3

* The top-most segment of the Troll Lift stands on a semi-circular platform of stone jutting into the Great Chasm.
	* The platform is open to the chasm, and covered in a badly damaged mosaic showing images of horned bipeds (rudishva) directing varumani, bird-creatures (varuda) and snakes (kaliyani) against amphibianoid foes.
* The Lift proper is composed of several parts:
	* A rectangular opening (5’x10’) in the pavement
	* A pair of 10’-tall iron poles either side of the hole supporting a wooden frame over the hole
	* Guy-lines extending from the side of the platform to the iron apparatus
	* A pair of iron cranks
	* Over 600’ of heavy silk rope coiled around the upper portion of the apparatus
	* A cage of iron and wood lowered through the rectangular opening 600’ to 6-3.
	* Passage up or down takes 11-20 minutes, marked by swaying, creaking, and generally nauseating stops and starts of the iron and wood cage.

Operation of the Lift
* Passage must be arranged with Riglon in area 5-54.
* Two huge bestial varumani crank the winch to raise or lower the cage.
	 * (75%) the two bestial varumani laborers – whom Riglon has ‘named’ Trilti and Gerg - are present; otherwise (25%) they are taking a break in 5-56.
 * They are quick to come to Riglon’s aid if circumstances demand it (see 5-54).

Trilti and Gerg (75%), bestial varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 61, 50; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; 
immune to poison.

		* Four goblins are always present, with spears and crossbows to repel any unwanted chasm-crawlers.
	* Smoky from a fire that burns in the center of it, but it smells delicious.
		* The varumani use dried mushrooms as fuel.
		* 25 lb of dried mushrooms as fuel stacked nearby.
	* 12 musty baboon pelts sewn into three blankets
	* A set of wooden drinking mugs and a stone water barrel
		* A 5,000 gp diamond hidden in the water.
	* A 5’-wide archway leads to a small balcony that overlooks the chasm.

Trilti and Gerg (25%), bestial varumani: for statistics see 5-55.

4 goblin slaves, armed with crossbows and spears: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 6, 5, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (spear) or 1-4 (light crossbow).

### 5-57: Tomb of Sethu: False Tomb

* A curtain of hanging creepers conceals the entrance to Sethu’s tomb.
	* Originally a plaster plug textured to look like the surrounding stone obscured the entrance, but a 6’ hole has been cut in the plaster, allowing access.
* A long tunnel leads from the chasm.
	* Sheathed in painted plaster showing servitors bearing all manner of goods, mundane and valuable, towards the chamber to the northeast.
	* Halfway down the corridor a 5’-square block of stone has fallen from the ceiling; a pair of skeletal legs protrudes from beneath the block.
* The chamber is decorated with some 20 full-sized images of servitors bearing chests, piles of food, rods, baskets of coins, and so forth towards a figure whose image occupied the northeast wall.
	* An inscription runs along the top of the northeast wall in Mithric: “Sethu, Protonotarius of Arden Vul, High Priest of Thoth, rests here. Those who disturb his rest shall pay!”
	* A large stone sarcophagus, whose lid lies shattered on the floor.
		* Around the sarcophagus is a litter of broken objects, smashed crockery, violated canopic jars, empty chests, 7 sp and 5 cp, some fragments of gilt wood, and bits of scroll are all that remain.
		* Lying in the trash are the corpses of two adventurers, who seem to have met their end by being clawed and beaten to death.  Next to them is a shattered skeleton of large size.
			* Their equipment is of extremely archaic vintage; nothing like it has been seen in many centuries.
	* Secret Door (southeast): part way down the corridor is a 4’-square secret door leading to the real tomb.
		* Opens by pressing both eyes of one of the painted servitors at the same time.

* GM Note: Sethu designed this first room of his tomb to make it look as if plunderers had already cleaned out his tomb.

### 5-58: Tomb of Sethu: Antechamber

* A narrow corridor (4’ wide by 5’ high) snakes from the entrance corridor to this antechamber.
* The antechamber is 8’ tall and 10’ square.
	* It is packed with with gilt-wood furniture - two bed frames, three frames for hangings, six stools, three chests, and four thin chairs (1500 gp total, but extremely fragile, save vs transform at +3 to move without breakage; gilt alone is 30 gp).
		* In the chests: dried out grain, dusty nuts and dried fruit; 3,429 ancient copper bits; and a set of copper plates and goblets (15 gp).
	* Amid the furniture are ten 4’-tall stone shabti figures, painted a bright shade of orange, of servants bearing spears and clubs.
		* To a buyer of antiquities (50 gp each, 50 lb).
		* The shabti warriors are Archontean animated constructs (new).
			* They animate if and when Thoth’s breath (see 5-60) reach them.  They pursue intruders throughout the tomb.
			* Due to the age of the mechanism, 25% chance for 2d4+2 shabtis to animate 6 rounds after the trap in 5-60 is triggered.
	* The walls are decorated with paint and gilt, showing Thoth spitting out streams of words, shedding light on darkness, smiting serpents, and treading on amphibians.
	* Secret Door (northeast): easy to find (1 in 4)
		* Opened by a button on the northwest wall.

10 Archontean animated constructs - shabti warriors (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 13(x10); #AT 1; Dmg 3-8; MR 25%. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons (but double-damage from crushing weapons); immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells.

### 5-59: Tomb of Sethu: Preparation Room

* Another 4’ x 5’ tunnel leads from the secret door to this 8’-tall preparation room.
	* Carved on the wall (Mithric): “The servants of Sethu thrive in the breath of Thoth.”
	* The floor of the chamber contains four alabaster canopic jars, each with a solid gold figure on its lid: a jackal, an ibis, a serpent, and a falcon (200 gp each).
		* Sethu’s heart rests inside one of the jars; a 5,000 gp ruby stuffed into it.
	* Surrounding the jars are twelve more 4’-tall, orange-painted stone shabti figurines (Archontean animated constructs) depicting servants carrying spears and clubs. 
		* The shabti warriors animate once the breath of Thoth reaches them, that is, 3 rounds after the trap in 5-60 is triggered.

12 Archontean animated constructs - shabti warriors (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 13(x12); #AT 1; Dmg 3-8; MR 25%. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons (but double-damage from crushing weapons); immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells.

### 5-60: Tomb of Sethu: Real Tomb

* Another 4’x5’ tunnel opens into the real tomb of Lord Sethu.
* The tomb is 15’ high, and all four walls are covered with brightly painted plaster images.
	* The images show: Sethu commanding servants to dig (in the Halls), directing warriors against bipedal salamanders, offering scrolls before Thoth, and receiving the obeisance of lesser clergy.
	* The center of the southeast wall holds a huge stone face of Thoth in frontal view.
		* It is three dimensional, and features fierce eyes and an open mouth.
		* Above the face is written (Mithric): “Sethu lives in the Breath of Thoth.”
	* Before the face is a 7’-long sarcophagus with a three-quarter image of Sethu in full ceremonial robes on its lid.
		* If the lid of the sarcophagus is disturbed, the Guardian of Sethu (5-61) animates and breaks through the plaster wall to assault the desecrators.
		* Inside: Sethu's mummy wearing a golden djed amulet (new) and two platinum rings (150 gp each). 777 ancient silver pennies; 333 ancient gold solidi; 5 pieces of jade (100 gp each).
	* Standing against the (false plaster) walls to either end of the room are 6 stone shabti warriors (Archontean animated constructs).
* (pressure plate) the floor from the entrance to the sarcophagus, activated by 50 lb.
	* A loud ‘click’ is heard, and thick blue-gray gas pours from the mouth of the image of Thoth.
	* This gas obscures vision and fills the true tomb and preparation room within 3 rounds; some of it may also reach the antechamber after an additional 3 rounds.
	* The gas animates shabti figurines, who move swiftly to attack intruders. Neutralizing the gas immobilizes the shabti warriors.

6 Archontean animated constructs - shabti warriors (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 13(x6); #AT 1; Dmg 3-8; MR 25%. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to 
hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons (but double-damage from crushing weapons); immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells.

### 5-61: Tomb of Sethu: Guardian

* A decorated false plaster wall (difficult to spot, 1-in-8) separates this chamber from the main tomb.
	* If Sethu’s sarcophagus is opened, the 10' tall jackal-headed, brightly-painted guardian here bursts through the plaster, a flail in each hand.

1 imperial stone guardian (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 60; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to 
missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

### 5-62: Tomb of Sethu: Treasury

* A false plaster wall conceals an undecorated stone wall with a 6’ stone door in its center.
	* The door is locked and leads to a small chamber with five badly tarnished 4' tall urns holding Sethu's riches.
		* They appear as base metal, but are actually platinum (6,000 gp each).
		* Urn 1: 7,613 ancient silver pennies
		* Urn 2: 4,156 ancient gold solidi
		* Urn 3: 27,351 ancient copper bits
		* Urn 4: 153 ancient octagonal platinum coins
		* Urn 5: ankh of healing (20 charges, new); a scroll (mirror image, improved phantasmal force, fear, and suggestion); a wand of magic missiles (20 charges); a staff of power (17 charges)
			* Design notes (secret tongue of Thoth) to the great treasury of Thoth on Level 3 (3-2 and 3-23).
				* The first priests of our Ibis Lord had an ingenious method for storing Thoth’s riches. It involved a three-part ritual, in which each of the three main images of the God was manipulated into the iconic pose. Only then would the way to the treasury be revealed. We are only ants standing on the shoulders of such giants! 
### 5-63: Hidden Stairs Down to 8-35

* The door to this chamber is locked.
* The 15’-tall chamber inside is undecorated save for two 10’-tall stone statues.
	* The western statue is Larel One-Eye: shabbily dressed, slightly hunched, with a sack over his shoulder, a phrygian cap, an eye-patch, and a pilgrim’s staff (see 3-46).
	* The eastern statue is Jacinth the Rose: waist-length hair, loose tunic and trousers and a skull cap, and carrying a long-stemmed rose and a slim rapier. 
	* The eyes of each statue are 3"-diameter crystals: Larel’s are yellow, Jacinth’s are red. The eyes detect as magic and are removable (50 gp each).
* The grey granite floor is interrupted by an oval 10’x15’ plug of white marble.
	* On the marble is carved (Archontean): “To proceed one must sometimes adopt a new perspective.”
	* Beneath this plug are a set of worn stairs leading down 1,000’ through many landings and turns to 8-35.  The plug is retractable by manipulating the statues.
		* The white marble plug retracts for 2 hours if the crystal eyes of the statues are exchanged (i.e., adopting a ‘new perspective’).  To open the cover on subsequent visits, the eyes must again be shifted.

### 5-64: Barricade and Secret Staircase Up to 3-52a

* A 5’-tall pile of broken pavement and stone chunks blocks the passage at this point.
	* North of the barricade shows signs of activity, dust and debris swept to the sides.
	* South of the barricade, dust lies thick and undisturbed.
	* It is easy to climb over the barricade, although those doing so may regret their actions!
* Secret Door (northeast): difficult to locate on this side, opens by pulling it outwards (hefty). 
	* It leads to a 5’-wide staircase rising 250’ to 3-52a.
	* GM Note: Durdeon Vislok (AV-12) uses the secret door leading to 3-52a to access this level along the way to the Arena.  He makes sure to cover his tracks, literally.

### 5-65: Dangerous Sinkhole

* Time, water and other events have caused a substantial portion of the overhanging rock and earth of this cavern to fall inward, resulting in a large sinkhole extending under 5-83.
* The sinkhole cavern is 60’ tall, 40’ extending below the worked areas (5-83 and 5-64).
	* Amid debris in the bottom is a gold key to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D).
	* Several smaller side passageways lead from the sinkhole to the chasm.
	* The area is damp and humid
	* Those approaching from either side will hear loud slithering and cracking noises from the depths of the sinkhole.
* A terrible paralyzing brain (new) inhabits this sinkhole.
	* The debased monks feed it on occasion, which it supplements by snagging tasty treats that venture too close in the chasm.
	* Sound or light rouse it from quiescence (1 Turn before tentacles rise from the depths and grope after prey).

1 paralyzing brain (new): SZ M; AL NE; AC 4; MV 120’ flying (Class A); HD 10; HP 67; #AT 11; Dmg 1-6(x10)/2-12. Special attacks: paralyzation (saves at +2); surprise on 1-3. Special defenses: immune to electricity; tentacles regenerate in 2-3 days.

## Level 5: 66 - 75 (Realm of the Vivisectionist)

* These areas are the home to a formidable and highly psychotic being, the ancient rudishva known as Psalor-Ki (see 5-74).
	* Psalor-Ki was one of the last offspring produced by the survivors of the wreck of the Beacon over 2,900 years ago.
	* Immune to the heqeti plague which killed most of his people, and finding himself both attuned to magic and practically immune to aging, Psalor-Ki has slowly grown more and more unbalanced as the centuries have progressed.
* In the first years after the collapse of the rudishva hegemony, he worked with other survivors to try to find a way to prolong all of their lives
	* He and Artax-Ris pioneered some risky experiments with the rudishva hyperbaric chambers (tech) resulting in the giant rudishva and varumani skeletons.
	* With the failure of these experiments and his own drift into madness, Psalor-Ki was abandoned by (and/or drove away) the other survivors and carved out a small realm for himself in this section of Level 5.
* He dominates the area through his own formidable powers and through the efforts of his slaves and undead minions.
	* The center of his domain is a horrific laboratory where he experiments on those unfortunate enough to fall into his clutches. 
	* Most of the denizens of Levels 5 and 6 speak of him with dread as “the Master”, “the Old One”, or “the Drainer.”
	* Psalor-Ki could probably take a larger role in the politics of the Halls were he not both deranged and obsessed; his powers would certainly allow him to control more of Level 5 should he desire it.  Instead, he is content to conduct his mad experiments in isolation.
* The varumani could probably wipe him out if they tried hard enough, long genetic and social conditioning have rendered them wary of him, and he is largely left to his own devices.
	* Riglon, the vice-overseer of the Troll Lift (see 5-54), is palpably afraid of him.  One of Riglon’s tasks to supply Psalor-Ki with whatever he demands (periodically Psalor-Ki will send two ichor spawn with a list of required supplies; the varumani fulfill the request within 3 days).
	* Due to his necromantic experiments, including the creation of giant rudishva skeletons, Psalor-Ki is loathed and hated by all the other rudishva survivors.

* It is at least conceivable that Psalor-Ki might decide to negotiate with PCs, especially those who have proven themselves mildly competent (perhaps by defeating some of his minions) and somewhat interesting.
	* Psalor-Ki has a particular interest in experimenting with dwarf innards.
	* Psalor-Ki might overwhelm a party of non-dwarven PCs only to assign them a difficult mission: procuring something like the ichor of three chasm cephalopods or a dragon’s eye.
	* He cannot not magically compel the fulfillment of such missions.  Abrogating an agreement with Psalor-Ki incurs his lasting enmity; he will sense the PCs’ presence in any location east of the chasm on Level 5 and proceed to attack them. 

### 5-66: Great Hall

* A landing on the west end overlooks this large, garish hall, 15' above the floor.  The ceiling of the room is another 15’ above the landing.
	* A 20’-tall statue stands at the west end in a 20’ diameter basin, with 2’ tall rim.
		* The statue is of the Nataraja, a rudishva depiction of the Lord of the Dance, who is responsible for all creative and destructive impulses.
		* The figure balances on one leg, with the other folded across its front. It is hermaphroditic and six arms swirl in a rough circle around its head.
			* The arms hold symbols: a knife, a heart, a lily, a miniature eagle, an ascetic’s sandal, and an eye-shaped bloodstone gem (275 gp).
		* The figure continuously weeps a viscous red fluid that collects in the pool (a source of the fluid that powers Psalor-Ki’s ichor-zombies).
	* The east end is painted in bright hues of red and yellow, with four huge (20’-diameter) sunburst medallions with depictions of incarnations of Psalor-Ki (5-74).
	* Torches in sconces on the north and south walls shed a smoky light on the scene.
	* The area reeks of the charnel house.

* If people descend into the chamber, the torches flare and a throbbing, pulse-like bass rhythm commences (triggered by magic sensors in the statue seeing and hearing them).
	* Within 1d4 rounds, the minions of the master (ichor spawn, new) file out of 5-67 and 5-68 to confront the intruders.
	* They attempt to grapple intruders and subdue them for inspection by Psalor-Ki.
	* Ichor spawn reduced to zero hit points crawl slowly towards the pool of liquid (1d3 rounds).  The liquid heals them 1d4 hp per round, once at half hit points, the ichor spawn returns to the fight.

### 5-67: Minions’ Rest

* The stairs from 5-66 lead down 10’ to a dimly lit chamber painted a sickly yellow.
	* 10 of Psalor-Ki’s ichor spawn rest here.
	* These foul creatures stand inertly until the throbbing pulse begins in 5-66, at which point they shuffle up the stairs to confront intruders.

10 ichor spawn (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 22, 22, 21, 21, 19(x3), 17, 16, 15; #AT 2; Dmg 1-8/1-8. Special attack: ichor spray if takes more than 8 HP from one blow (spray does 2-12 HP, plus corrodes metal and/or leather).

### 5-68: Minions’ Rest

* Identical to 5-67, save for the existence of doors on the east and west walls.
	* The door to the west is locked and unused. 
	* The door to 5-69, however, is merely shut and is well oiled. 
	* Ten ichor spawn wait for the alarm to sound in 5-66.

10 ichor spawn (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 22, 22, 21, 21, 19(x3), 17, 16, 15; #AT 2; Dmg 1-8/1-8. Special attack: ichor spray if takes more than 8 HP from one blow (spray does 2-12 HP, plus corrodes metal and/or leather).

### 5-69: Pulsating Stairs

* These stairs descend 40 feet and are lit by a dull red continual light spell that pulses (72 beats per minute).
	* Should Psalor-Ki (5-74) be slain, the pulsating red light will cease.

### 5-70: Niche

* A smaller statue of the nataraja (only 4’ tall) occupies this semi-circular niche; this is a watcher nataraja (new) enchanted by Psalor-Ki.
	* It hops off its perch and follows anyone not marked by the sign of the vivisectionist.
	* It does not attack, but Psalor-Ki can hear and see through the statue’s eyes and ears.  He uses the statue’s information to plot an appropriate greeting for intruders.

### 5-71: Bubbling Vats

* This large chamber holds one portion of Psalor-Ki’s foul experiments, attentively watched by his vat keeper.
	* Here the vivisectionist dabbles in the qualities of fluids both biological and magical, some of the results of which include the ichor spawn and various puddings and jellies.
* The room is brightly lit with plain white light, and its walls are painted black, but bear chalk sketches of tubes, half-sections of bodies, and some alchemical symbols.
	* Heavy black drapes section off the northwest and southwest corners.
		* Northwest curtain: a simple bed, an armoire, and a small table. Aside from some unusual clothing (rudishva) there is nothing of value here.
		* Southwest curtain: a stone varuda (rudishva animated construct), carved in a semi-crouch, with wings extending in a corona around its fierce-beaked visage.
			* Animates if either Psalor-Ki or the watcher nataraja (5-70) inserts a finger into its open beak.
			* If activated, the statue is quite destructive, and will likely overturn multiple vats. Roll for miscibility!
	* A heavy oak table rests against the west wall, and stone containers line the northeast wall.
		* Worktable: 12 empty glass beakers, two beakers filled with sickly-purple fluid (purple puddings).  A handful of 3”-long sticks of strange flexible material (instant heat sources (tech), used to bubble vats).
		* Underneath the bench is a pile of broken crockery and glassware.
	* The center of the chamber is filled with a collection of stone vats filled with viscous fluids of various colors that bubble at different rates.
		* The largest five are 4’ tall and 4’ in diameter.
			* Vat 1: thick, sickly-purple fluid (purple pudding, new), attacks those who inspect the vat.
			* Vat 2: mustard-yellow, medium-viscosity fluid (5 doses), deadly toxin (1d4 on touch, 4d4 if sipped). Can be bottled and used as a weapon.
			* Vat 3 (with four small vats around it): rusty-brown colored, thin-viscosity fluid (4 doses).  Imparts some troll-like features (+1 AC permanently, regeneration for 2-8 hours) if drunk, but also permanently -1 Wisdom.
				* The four small vats (2' tall, 3' diameter) with glass tubes running between them all contain life fluids (human blood, mixed brain matter, humanoid bone marrow, and varumani blood).
			* Vat 4: dull, red, pudding-like fluid, with noxious odor (3 doses). A cure-all (cures  disease, act as a restoration spell, heals 3d8.
			* Vat 5: thin, crimson fluid which looks like blood (Rudishva blood, 6 doses).  If drunk, causes nausea for 3d4 hours. If two doses are drunk, imparts clairvoyance for 1d3 days (nausea continues the entire period).
		* The vat-keeper (new) putters from vat to vat, stirring and peering into each.
			* The keeper appears as a shambling, puffy, and oddly-colored 8’-tall being; it is, in fact, a deformed ogre with an altered circulatory system.

* There is a 25% chance that Psalor-Ki is present in this room, examining his fluids.
	* Otherwise he is found in 5-72 (25%) or in his lair 5-74 (50%).
* If the watcher nataraja from 5-70 is following PCs and Psalor-Ki is not initially here, 75% chance that he will appear here within 5 rounds, accompanied by the shadows from 5-72.

The vat-keeper of Psalor-Ki (new): SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 35; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8 or 3-6 (dagger +2). Special attacks; spit purple (2-12 HP, once every 3 rds). Special defenses: immune to poison and mind-affecting spells.

Psalor-Ki (25%): for stats see 5-74

### 5-72: Vivisectionarium

* This brightly lit chamber is the true heart of Psalor-Ki’s foul depravity, for it is here that he dismembers and reassembles the bodies of his victims.
	* The center of the chamber has three stone tables (with restraints), at the head of which is a pair of standing iron frames into which victims can be shackled.
		* Under each table is a covered wooden pail holding a mix of purple pudding and rudishva blood.  If poured down the throat of any dead creature, it "revives" as an ichor spawn (new). The concoction does not animate on its own.
	* North and south walls: a combination of cages and chains bolted to the wall
		* They hold 3-8 individuals at any one time (see table below for possibilities).
	* East wall: two battered worktables with a dozen very sharp knives of various sizes.
		* One is an enchanted varumani flensing knife (new).
		* Underneath the workbench is an open stone box with a pile of equipment stolen from Psalor-Ki’s victims.
			* 175 cp, 271 sp, 97 gp, a silver ring (25gp), a platinum torc (275 gp), various mundane adventuring gear (10 pieces, determine randomly).
		* Stored underneath the work tables is a rudishva hyperbaric chamber (tech). 
			* Psalor-Ki used it many centuries ago to create giant rudishva skeletons.
			* It currently lacks power (greater power supply), but still functions.
	* Secret Door (east): easy to find (1 in 4) by noticing the small indentation in the stonework into which reddish liquid seems to have been poured.
			* Opens if rudishva blood is dribbled into the aperture (e.g., the rudishva blood in 5-71). 

* Three shadows are bound to this room in unwilling servitude to Psalor-Ki. They attack any intruder.
* (25%) Psalor-Ki is present, dissecting a victim.
	* Otherwise he is found inspecting the vats in 5-71 (25%) or in his lair 5-74 (50%).
* If the watcher nataraja (see 5-70) is following the PCs and if Psalor-Ki is not initially here, 75% chance he emerges from 5-73 within 3 rounds, shouting for the vat-keeper from 5-71 (who appears in another 4 rounds).

Psalor-Ki (25% chance): for stats, see 5-74

### 5-73: Secret Antechamber

* This antechamber is brightly lit.
* Densely writhing figures - animal and humanoid - are carved into every available surface.
	* The carvings writhe, hiss, and sputter as if they were alive, but are harmless.
		* Psalor-Ki can see through the eyes of these writhing carvings (thus unlikely to be surprised by foes approaching 5-74).
* A 5’-diameter hole (surrounded by a 3’-tall stone parapet) marks the center of the room.
	* Leads to a rough stone tunnel extending down 25’ before turning south.  It eventually turns upward again, leading (without handholds) to 5-74.

### 5-74: Private Chamber of Psalor-Ki

* The tunnel from 5-73 emerges into the richly appointed chamber of Psalor-Ki.
* The decor is a mixture of the lushly ornate and the severely efficient.
	* A thick carpet embroidered with an image of a strange vehicle with a nimbus of fire around it (the Beacon).
		* Woven specifically for this chamber, with a 5’-diameter hole in its center.
	* Four semi-circular niches each boast a plain, ugly grey plasteel side-table (each holds an object special to Psalor-Ki). 
		* North: a 1,300-year old porcelain punchbowl (3,750 gp to an antiquarian) filled with a mixture of coins (450 sp, 326 gp, 157 cp) as well as copper, bronze, and platinum rudishva identity plaques, and a token of Arden (av items).
		* South: a rosewood box inlaid with platinum and ivory (90 gp), containing 2 ioun stones (clear and dark blue) and 6 huge pearls (500 gp each).
		* East: a mummified hand wearing (on thumb), the bone ring of Jagri-Naz.  Behind the hand lies a niravairi astral dripping sword (new).
			* FFS - Psalor-Ki is wearing the ring, not putting it on display.
		* West: a plastic cube showing a hologram of two adult and three young  rudishva, all dressed in unusual costumes (Psalor-Ki’s family; despite his madness, it remains his most prized possession).
* A baroquely carved settee made of ebony serves as his resting couch.
	* Behind it is a strange contraption of metal, wires and plasteel, a GnuCoder 5000 full-immersion sensory experience (tech).  It is broken and inoperable (see 6-117).
* Against the north wall are two ebony bookshelves filled with codices, scrolls, and data crystals (see below).
* Against the south wall are three standing racks, each of which holds the complete skeleton of a different species: human, varumani, and goblin.
* A desk, of the same carved ebony, stands to the south of the entrance well
	* On it is a set of fine crystal glasses and decanter, an inkwell and several quills. 
* Secret Door (south): opens by sliding a 3’-square panel upwards.
	* It leads to a short unworked tunnel and a second secret door opening into 5-75.

* 50% chance Psalor-Ki is present here. Otherwise he is found in the vivisectionarium (5-72; 25%) or in the room of vats (5-71, 25%).
	* The watcher nataraja (5-70), through whose eyes Psalor-Ki can see, may cause the rudishva to move elsewhere in his complex to confront intruders.

### 5-75: Spiral Stair Down to 6-57

* In the days of the rudishva dominance of the Halls, this was a primary stair connecting Levels 5 and 6.  It leads down 600’ to 6-57.
	* Psalor-Ki blocked off the original passage to 5-66, leaving only the secret passage from 5-74 to access this broad, marble, circular stair.
* Secret Door (east): hard to detect from the stair side (1 in 8 chance). Opens by sliding a 3’-square panel upwards.

## Level 5: 76 - 90

### 5-76: Porch and Stairs Up to 3-55

* The floor of the chamber is thick with dust and trash, except for a path marked with bare human footprints running from the eastern corridor to the porch.
	* To the north, stairs lead up 250’ to 3-55, filled with spider webs. 
	* In the southwest corner is a Thothian teleportation ring (RE-GR-WH-BK-BL-YE).
		* No glass activation squares are present.
* The porch is an 8’-wide opening into the chasm, fronted by a low balustrade.
	* The debased monks (new, and 5-78 to 5-83) use the porch as a site for hunting chasm cephalopods and other food sources.
* The debased monks have erected two traps in the room.
	* Tripwire: 3” above the ground, placed 5’ behind the balustrade across the opening to the porch.
		* Triggers a net hidden in the dust and trash on the floor and a loud clattering of metal on rock.  Roll 3d8 under DEX prevents 1-4 persons from being entrapped for 1d6+4 rounds. 7-10 debased monks arrive in 1d3+4 rounds.
	* Snares: 3 easy to spot (1-in-4) snares are concealed in the trash near the exit to 5-77. Those ensnared are immobilized for 3-6 rounds.

7-10 debased monks (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5, MV 120’; HD 4, HP 30, 28, 27, 27, 26(x3), 25, 25, 24; #AT 2, Dmg 1-6/1-6. Special attacks: disease (10% chance per hit). Special defenses: immune to charm; turned, temporarily, as wights.

30, 28, 27, 26, 26, 26, 25, 24

### 5-77: Vestibule

* This vestibule to the hidden temple of Thoth was once covered in beautiful frescoes, now defaced by the debased monks.
	* Crude images of snaky tentacles, white bipedal figures, and lots of bones.
	* It smells terribly of the charnel house - blood, charred meat, smoke, and decay.
	* Two enormous cauldrons (6’ in diameter, 4’ tall) sit in the center of the chamber, bubbling merrily.
		* They hold humanoid bodies being boiled for consumption by the monks.
		* They are cauldrons of boiling (new).
		* A chipped azurite gem (50gp) rests in the bottom of one of the cauldrons. 
	* Secret Door (south): difficult to find (1 in 8), the debased monks don't know of it.  Opens when a 2” stone square on the west wall is pressed.
		* The tunnel beyond leads towards the great pillar (5-138).
		* The priests of Thoth delved this corridor, seeking access to the pillar, but they could not breach the walls of its chamber, leaving a dead end (a narrow side spur also failed to find a weak point).
			* The end wall is smooth black, nigh-impenetrable granite., treated by ancient kaliyani techno-sorcerers with anti-magic resistance.

### 5-78: Cells of the Monks

* In these cells dwell the debased, undying remnants of an elite monastic order once devoted to Thoth.  Corrupted and enslaved by Oziman (see 5-83), these horrific beings live on as cannibalistic shadows of their former selves.
	* The narrow, door-less passages and cells stink badly and are smeared with feces, blood, and bits of food.
	* At any one point there are 12-18 ‘monks’ resident here (the others in 5-83).
	* In total: 37 debased monks (new) living among the cells.
		* Those slain elsewhere (e.g. in 5-76) should be subtracted from the total. 
* Cells come in one of three types:
	* A: disgusting nests in which 2 or more monks dwell in filth and stench. Nothing save scraps of flesh and bone may be found here.
	* B: one monk lives in each, which are noticeably cleaner.
		* 33% chance of finding (d6) jewelry (1-2), a gem (3-4) or a few coins (5-6).
	* C: resembles the A-type, but has a secret door on the west wall (opens by pressing a button out in the hallway).
* Secret Room: unfouled, and decorated with Thothian frescos.
	* A badly rotted wooden desk and chair occupy the center of the room; in the chair slumps the desiccated cadaver of a human (Hesius).
		* They drank poison from a pewter goblet (10 gp).
		* On the desk is a parchment testament, "the Lamentations of Hesius, or the Last Days of Lord Thoth’s Dominion", by a “Hesius Tecum, apocrisarius of the Inner Order” (books).
		* On the desk is a small, octavo volume containing the full Litany of Light, and a slip of parchment (Mithric) with the words "yellow-red-green-blue-black-white" (the teleporter address for 7-131).
	* A portable altar and shrine to Thoth.
		* Four mini-columns (3’ high) of ebon-wood, carved to resemble ibis-headed men.
		* If brought to the Sanctum (5-83), and should a good-aligned character recites the Litany of Light before it, the demon Oziman will be weakened (see 5-83).
	* A wooden chest against the north wall.
		* 3 large golden figurines (shabti figures) of Thoth (250 gp each), a bag of holding (70 cubic feet variety), a packet of dust of dryness, and a ring of wizardry (doubles first through third level spells). 

Up to 37 debased monks (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5, MV 120’; HD 4, HP 31, 30(x3), 29, 28(x3), 27(x7), 26(x9), 25(x8), 24(x5); #AT 2, Dmg 1-6/1-6. Special attacks: disease (10% chance per hit). Special defenses: immune to charm; turned, temporarily, as wights.

### 5-79: Cloister of the Monks

* Half-columns line the walls (every 5’), with traces of their original sky-blue paint.
	* A 10’x5’ pool occupies the center of the room. Water flows from the open beak of a slender bronze ibis into the center of the pool.
		* The water in the pool is cool and delicious, and heals 2d6 HP per draught per day. If put in a container, the water retains its potency for 24 hours.
	* Crude graffiti in bastardized Mithric spoils the room.
		* “Oziman is Thoth is Oziman is Thoth is Oziman,” “The Light will fail without blood” “Unbelievers shall be consumed,” “Claudius tasted delicious”, etc.
	* Secret Door (north): opens by sliding a 3’x4’ panel upwards. 
		* The monks have forgotten the existence of the secret door.

3-6 debased monks (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5, MV 120’; HD 4, HP 28, 27, 27, 26, 26, 25; #AT 2, Dmg 1-6/1-6. Special attacks: disease (10% chance per hit). Special defenses: 
immune to charm; turned, temporarily, as wights.

### 5-80: Archimandrite’s Quarters

* This room has been badly ransacked over the centuries, and is now home to the leader of the debased monks, Kiwu (50% present, otherwise in 5-83).
	* Metit was the last archimandrite (leader) of the Inner Order, slain by Kiwu.  His skeleton is gagged and nailed to the norht wall with five iron staples.
		* Due to Metit’s piety and the foul enormities committed in the Sanctum, the skeleton exists as a plaintive revenant, seeking the restoration of the Sanctum.
		* The skeleton twitches excitedly if visitors enter.
		* If ungagged, it explains its situation (Mithric).
			* It knows much less of the history of the collapse of the Sanctum than does Hesius (5-78), but insists Oziman is NOT an incarnation of Thoth and that Kiwu and his followers have abandoned the Path of Light.
			* Metit does not know how to reconsecrate the Sanctum, nor does he know that that act will release him from his current state.
		* If removed from the wall, Metit’s body crumbles into a heap of bones.  It can still speak, but cannot move on its own.
		* If the Sanctum is reconsecrated, Metit’s spirit will be released.

Kiwu, strong debased monk (see new monsters) (50% chance): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5, MV 120’; HD 6, HP 39; #AT 2, Dmg 1-6/1-6. Special attacks: disease (15% chance per hit); +2 to hit and damage due to ferocity. Special defenses: immune to charm.
* A cunning fellow of enormous size and power, Kiwu enforces his status with blows and fear. In life he was the lowest of the monks and deeply envious of the last archimandrite (leader) of the Inner Order, a man named Metit. As a result Oziman easily corrupted Kiwu, who then led the others down the path of savagery and chaos.

Metit, passive revenant (no combat stats).

### 5-81: Bridge to the Sanctum

* A narrow (4’-wide) and short (8’-long) stone bridge spans the chasm at this location.

### 5-82: Lesser Chasm

* The floor of this small extension of the main chasm lies 100’ below.
	* Its floor will found countless gnawed bones, several pieces of jewelry, and 2-4 carcass creepers feasting on the monks’ refuse. 
		* 6 pieces of jewelry: a golden coronet (900 gp); a silver and gold locket (800 gp); a gold bracelet studded with emeralds (7,000 gp); a silver and gold seal (800 gp); a silver necklace set with three deep blue spinels (1,500 gp); and a silver statuette of a female Archontean legionary (600 gp).

2-4 carcass creepers: SZ L; AL N; AC 3 (head) or 7 (body); MV 120’; HD 3+1; HP 21, 19, 18, 15; #AT 8; Dmg nil. Special attacks: paralysis.

### 5-83: The Sanctum

* The Sanctum used to be the spiritual heart of the cult of Thoth in Arden Vul, served by an elite group of ascetic clergy known as the monks of the Inner Circle.
	* It was the site of the most holy rituals and summonings.
	* In the chaos of the fall of Arden Vul, the Inner Circle was corrupted by a demon named Oziman, and the Sanctum despoiled.
	* Oziman still resides in the Sanctum, continuing his masquerade as an avatar of Thoth and enjoying the service of the undying former members of the Inner Circle. 

* The Sanctum is a looming nave of granite 35’ tall in the center, flanked by side chapels (15’ tall) and culminating in a marble-clad apse.
	* Slender columns of red-flecked onyx define two narrow aisles (20’ tall).
	* The Sanctum is relatively clean and unspoiled.
	* Huge candelabra burn strange black candles that produce light but no smoke.
	* Frescoes depict the Twelve.
		* Along the first part of the nave, the frescoes depict generic scenes of the gods in action, with their usual iconography.
		* Around the apse, however, the scenes are more specifically Thothian.
	* The side chapels are nondescript.
		* One features a set of dusty (long unused) bedrolls and an empty wooden chest.
		* Each side chapel was dedicated to one of Thoth's incarnations, but the iconography was stripped away many centuries ago.
	* A 5' triangular plinth of white marble rises at the north end of the apse, supporting a 20’ statue of ibis-headed Thoth.
		* Thoth holds a scroll in his left hand, and a feather in the right.
		* His eyes are empty, stained with faint streaks of black, as if off tears.
		* South of the statue, at the mouth of the apse, is an open pit, 10’ square, which drops down into the darkness.
	* Between statue and pit is a red silk settee, on which Oziman the demon presides over his domain, continuing his rather transparent disguise as the avatar of Thoth.
		* Oziman appears as a slim human dressed in orange ceremonial robes and headdress of Thoth, and carrying a white, ibis-headed wand.
		* The ghoulish debased monks surround him all of the time. 
		* Piled in front of the settee is a mound of treasure.
			* 6,753 ancient copper bits; 7,498 ancient silver pennies; 4,302 ancient gold solidi
			* a piece of malachite (10 gp); a red garnet (100 gp); a chrysoberyl (100 gp); 12 aquamarines (100 gp each); an exceptional piece of alexandrite (1,000 gp); a begemmed golden chalice (4,000 gp); a beryl-encrusted silver locket (1,900 gp)
			* A seven-faceted crystal with one of the seven secret names of Thoth inscribed on each of the facets (for all seven names, see Secreta Secretorum in Arden Vul books; the crystal is worth 500 gp to an antiquarian)
			* A Thothian passkey (see Arden Vul items), a potion of fire breath
			* An intelligent long sword +2 (INT 12, Semi-empathy, LG, SA detect magic 10’ radius, EGO 3)
			* A rudishva tactical suit (see new technological items).
		* A pair of eyes of Pol stuffed under the settee (new)
	* Secret Door (east): opens by sliding a 3’x4’ panel upwards.
		* The debased monks have forgotten this secret door.
* Note: The Sanctum is the destination for one of the teleport heads at 2-10.
	* Arrivals appear at the entrance to the fane, just north of the bridge (5-81).

* Although the presence of the monks is likely to alert the PCs, Oziman attempts to negotiate at first.
	* If the PCs are powerful, Oziman praises them and offers shelter (in one of the side chapels) and advice about the rest of the dungeon. This advice is quite poor, and will be recognized as such by seasoned adventurers in the Halls.
	* Oziman recites a lot of empty talking points about Thothian practice, but most of this is shallow and superficial; anyone who has paid close attention to the frescoes on Levels 2 and 3, and/or who has studied the Litany of Light, recognizes Oziman as an impostor.
	* Should he be detected or accused, or should the PCs be foolish enough to accept his hospitality, Oziman orders the monks to attack and subdue the PCs.
	* He aids the monks with magic, and only sheds his polymorphed disguise and enters the fray himself if things are going badly. 

* Re-consecrating the Altar
	* If the portable altar of Thoth in the Hidden Chamber (5-78) is brought into the Sanctum, the black candles gutter out and Thoth’s presence returns.
	* Heroes gain +2 attack and save against Oziman and the monks within the Sanctum.
	* If the Litany of Light is then recited before the altar, Oziman immediately loses 1/3rd of his total HP and suffers -3 defense.

Oziman, a type III demon: SZ L; AL CE; AC -4; MV 90’; HD 10; HP 70; #AT 5; Dmg 2d6/2d6/1d3/1d3/1d4+1; MR 60%.

### 5-84: Transit Shaft

* The rudishva iris door to 5-18 is opens when a silver rudishva identity plaque is touched to the accompanying panel.
* The door on the west wall is also a rudishva iris door (see 5-86).
* The chamber is sheathed with white marble panels held together with silver grout (500 gp total).
	* A continual light spell cast on the 30’ ceiling provides bright, clean light.
	* Traffic has been minimal for many millennia, but the floor is free from dust and dirt.
* A softly gurgling basin of black granite is 15’ diameter and 3’ deep, filled with opalescent, sparkly liquid.
	* Anything coated in the liquid will levitate in the shaft.
	* The coating lasts for an hour, but can be brushed off easily.
* A 40’-square shaft, sheathed in white marble and silver grout, extends 1,100’ down into the lower Halls, commencing here and culminating on 9-91.
	* Built by the rudishva as swift transport for their officers, it detects as magical.
	* Anything tossed into the shaft will fall normally, unless coated in the opalescent liquid, in which case it can levitate within the pit.
	* Levitation is at the rate of 20’ of vertical distance per round.
	* Removal of even 10% of the silver grout cancels the levitation effect.
	* The shaft to accesses 6-164, 7-146 and 9-91.

### 5-85: Stinking Cavern and Lost Tomb

* Khalid's body was dumped down the shaft from 1-20, landing here in 5-85.

* This 15’-tall cavern has a curious, musty reek of decay, product of its former role as the bottom of the privy (located 550’ above, at 1-20).
	* The main cavern has a thin crust of ancient dried effluent, which crumbles and crackles under foot (harmless), but has attracted a gray ooze, hanging on the wall.
	* The privy hole is 6’ square with iron rungs leading up one side.
	* 12' up the northwest wall is a narrow, obscure hole leading to 5-85b.
* South of the chamber are three broad steps leading to a finished area 25’ square and 10’ tall, paved in grey slate.
	* Four corpses (one ancient, three modern) lie on the slate just beyond the steps.
		* All have been scorched as if by intense heat.
		* Ancient corpse: wears barely-recognizable robes of a priest of Set, clutches a deacon’s was stick (new) in his skeletal hand. 
		* Modern: two burned beyond recognition; the third has usable chain mail +1, a metal shield, and a long sword +1.
	* The finished walls of the niche feature brightly colored mosaics.
		* West: ancient Archonteans directing workers erecting the pyramid of Thoth.
		* East: an Archontean archon riding a dragon over the finished city of Arden Vul.
		* South: Archonteans inspect cave mouths from which protrude fierce dragon heads.
	* Subtle nozzles are placed every 5’ across the ceiling above the niche and stairs.
	* In the center is a beautiful porphyry sarcophagus.
		* If the sarcophagus is touched, nozzles instantly spout jets of fire (6d6, save for half) downward for 6 rounds (trap resets after 6 hours).  The trap is normal to detect, but almost impossible to disarm (-20%).
		* Incised on all sides with Mithric writing filled with silver.
			* Top: “Julian Grex, archon, he who first located the Obsidian Doors, plumbed the secrets of the Great Travelers, and revealed the properties of arcanum.”
			* Sides: “Great Architect”, “Humble Overseer”, “Beloved Father,” “Intrepid Explorer”, “Favored Rider.”
		* The lid is quite heavy (open doors to open).
			* Two ½”-diameter holes have been drilled in the lid.
			* Inside are the mummified remains of Julian Grex.
			* A lever inside the sarcophagus operates the secret door at 5-85a.
			* 1,753 ancient silver pennies; a fist-sized piece of arcanum; an annotated map of areas 7-1 and 7-72 to 7-76, scribed on a piece of brass; two disks (28” in diameter) of grooved, beaten gold with 1” holes in their centers (used to open the lesser obsidian gates, SL4-34); Stalker, a long bow +2, +4 versus animals (new); and 10 arrows +2 made of ebony. 
	* Secret Door (south): stone door rests on two recessed steel pins, and opens towards the south.
		* Easy to detect from the south side (1 in 4).  Opens when the lever in the sarcophagus is pulled. Swings closed after an hour.

* The soul of Julian Grex has turned into a slightly unusual spectre.
	* He stirs after the fire trap is triggered or the lid of the sarcophagus is moved.
	* Julian’s first act - before rising from his sarcophagus - is to raise the four (five, including Khalid) nearby corpses as 3 HD zombies.
	* He then emerges through the holes in the sarcophagus to smite intruders.

##### 5-85a: Tunnel to 5-19

* This roughly worked stone corridor runs between the tomb at 5-19 and Julian Grex’s resting place.
	* A desiccated corpse is slumped against the secret door at the north end of the tunnel (a female magic user)
		* A dagger +3, a packet of dust of sneezing and choking, and a bronze statuette of an Archontean orator (450 gp).

##### 5-85b: Tunnel Down to 7-141

* The narrow (3’ in diameter) entrance to this tunnel is 12’ up the northwest wall of 5-85.
	* It quickly widens before descending steeply over 800’ to 7-141.

### 5-86: Rudishva Iris Door

* This stone door is a rudishva iris door.
	* Opens when a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque is pressed against the accompanying panel.
* The ancient corpses of three priests of Thoth lie desiccated before the west side of the door, their vestments torn and their bodies battered.
	* Corpses: silver holy symbol of Thoth (10 gp); melted lump of silvery plastic; Pamiu’s gold signet ring w/ an ibis-inscribed cabuchon gem (225 gp); a scroll of protection from magic; 16 ancient gold solidi.
	* Their spirits remain close, two as wraiths and the other as a benign ghost.
	* Those approaching within 10’ are attacked by the wraiths, even as the benign spirit shouts warnings in Mithric.
		* The wraiths only atack those within 30’ of the door.
	* If the wraiths are eliminated, the benign spirit of Pamiu the Chanter can tell his story.
		* His friends located one of the plaques of the Old Ones (i.e., rudishva), made of a silvery, hard-but-light substance. To their delight, the plaque allowed them entry into the hidden realm of the Old Ones by way of the great shaft (5-84).
		* They hoped to discover great knowledge and treasure before informing their superiors of their discovery. Alas, they foolishly experimented with the sorcerous pits of fire (5-89), and unleashed a fire demon (elemental). It killed one of Pamiu’s friends and worse, melted the silver plaque into slag!
		* Pamiu and his surviving friend discovered that they could no longer open the door at 5-86. They explored a bit, and were chased by a huge stone bird (the stone varuda at 5-107), which slew them here, before the very door through which they had arrived. 
	* Pamiu can pass on the following useful information, in return for a promise of aid.
		* Don't turn the dials in 5-89 to zero, for then a fire elemental is released.
		* A dancing demon inhabits the entrance to the chamber to the west (see 5-90a); it is fierce, but can be tamed if one has a silver plaque.
		* The stone bird inhabiting the plaza to the west and south is invincible (5-107).
	* Pamiu asks for his signet ring to be brought to the main shrine of Thoth (3-71)
		* This allows his soul to be released.
		* Failing to do so withing a month may bring a powerful curse by Thoth himself.

2 wraiths: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 120’, 240’ flying (Class B); HD 5+3; HP 36, 31; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic weapons to hit; immune 
to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis. The wraiths are turned as vampires while they are within 5’ of their corpses. 

Pamiu the Chanter, benign ghost: no combat abilities.

### 5-87: East Storage Unit

* The door to this chamber swings easily on its hinges, its locking mechanism blasted into smithereens.
* Four large plasteel storage bins, some 3’x4’x3’ in size, line its walls, and are anchored to the floor.
	* The interior surfaces of the bins are coated in dried, lichen-like orange paste.
		* The paste is a dried ancient nutrient source; scraped up and rehydrated, it provides a nutritious and curative broth (10 bottles per bin, each bottle provides a daily ration and heals 1d6).
	* Boots, leather armor, and short sword are stacked in front of one bin.
		* Inside that bin is the complete, if jumbled, skeleton of a human adventurer.
* Slumped between the two bins on the south wall is a skeleton of an adventurer.
	* Both femurs of the slumped skeleton have been broken, as if by a heavy blow.
	* The adventurer holds a piece of parchment in his skeletal hand that reads (Mithric), “Silence! You must be quiet! I wasn’t quiet enough.”
		* GM Note: a cryptic reference to the varuda statue prowling 5-107 and beyond.
	* Ancient, but usable, suit of chain mail, gladius (short sword), grappling hook with 50’ of rope, a well-made zither (85 gp), and a pouch with 32 ancient silver pennies.

### 5-88: West Storage Unit

* The door to this storage chamber swings loosely on its hinges.
* Six storage bins of grey plasteel have been jammed inside the room, all empty.

### 5-89: Fire Pits of Creation

* The dull glow of fire that permeates this unusual chamber is visible from the hallway.
* The glow emanates from the lava that rests in the 4’-high basin of basalt running through this chamber.
	* Several fire elementals, bound here millennia ago by the rudishva to aid in their crafting endeavors, keep the lava molten.
* The ceiling is 10’ high, and the walls are without decoration.
* The six ‘arms’ of the room on the north, east, and west walls each contain a basalt mold.
	* Each molding station has a silver inset plaque with six rudishva symbols (the recipe materials and settings)
* The niche on the south wall serves as the control center.
	* Each mold is connected to the control center by wires running through the rock, but appears to be a freestanding, 4’-tall object.
	* Two stone storage boxes lie against the wall of the control niche.
		* Box #1: 20 ingots of high-quality steel (20 sp each, 0.5 kg each).
		* Box #2: 3 lumps of softly-glowing arcanum, 2 that are fist-sized (2 lb each) and one that is about 3’ in diameter (20 lb).
	* Hanging on the wall are:
		* 2 sets of plasteel tongs
		* 2 egg-shaped plasteel dippers (the plasteel is unaffected by the lava).
		* a small plasteel bucket for measuring 0.5 kg of arcanum.
		* a stone hammer
		* 3 steel chisels 

The rudishva crafted various objects using metals, stone, arcanum, and some alien materials. 
* Replicating these techniques is possible with the right materials, though without proper recipes the results are likely to be unpredictable and dangerous.
* Each mold has its own requirements, listed below.
* The six rudishva symbols on the molds: corresponds to 1) the amount of steel (in 1/2 kg); 2) the amount of arcanum; 3) the number of dipperfuls of lava; 4) temperature; 5) chthonic energy; and 6) phase.
* If the proper materials be placed in the mold and the proper settings ‘dialed’, the appropriate item will be created.
* It takes 4 turns for the item to cool enough to be removed from the mold.

Rudishva Glyphs
* Steel (element 26), silver (element 47), arcanum (energy-mineral), 
* Magic / spell (mind-shape-energy triplet)
* Temperature (heat-energy), cthonic energy (deep-energy), phase (matter-form)
	* none, low, moderate, solid (matter-form-solid), liquid (matter-form-liquid, or semi-liquid), gaseous (matter-form-gas)

A. Control Center
* A ridge of stone extends horizontally from the lava basin into this niche and connects to a 4’-tall arcanum-steel pedestal covered in a plasteel console (scarred, repurposed plate).
	* Three dials (stone knobs with steel indicators) are each marked by a rudishva glyph.
		* Mismatched dials scavenged from other rudishva tech.
	* The glyphs are “Temperature”, “Chthonic Energy,” and “Phase”.
	* Each dial has a range of unmarked stops as follows:
		* Temperature: 9 stops: from 0 (no heat) to 8 (hottest).
		* Chthonic Energy: 4 stops: 0 (none), 1 (low), 2 (moderate), 3 (high)
		* Phase: 6 stops: 0 (none), 1 (low - solid), 2 (low - semi-liquid), 3 (moderate - liquid) 4 (moderate - semi-gaseous), 5 (gaseous)
	* Starting Position: When first encountered, the dials are set at temperature=5, chthonic energy=2, phase=3
	* A covered button marked "Activate".
* Danger: 1 Turn after dialing both Temperature and Chthonic Energy to 0 (none), one of the fire elementals escapes from the lava basin.
		* Every turn the dials are kept in that position another elemental is released, until none are left.
		* A released elemental, maddened by long captivity, attacks on sight.
		* If all the elementals are released, the lava cools and the creation molds become useless.

Molds
* An open topped crucible to place the materials in.
* The drum of the mold, with a mold tray (or trays) that slides in and out.
* The steel plaque with the recipe.
* An indicator light
* Molds able to receive additional enchantments have a magical circle embossed on arcanum-steel on the front.
* Usage:
	* Load materials in crucible.  Pull down and latch lid.
	* Push in desired tray(s) of molds.
	* Set dials on control console.  Press Activate (powers on all molds whose lids are shut and molds in place).
	* Indicator light begins pulsing, goes steady when done.
	* Gases vent, machines hum, energy arcs and glows.
	* Additional magic is supplied now, but casting the spell onto the magical circle plate.
	* Pull the mold trays out, remove products.  Open lid.
		* All very hot.

B. Strut Mold
* Mold: 3 long, sinuous shapes (replacement parts for the Beacon); they are 3’ to 5’ long, 6” wide, and 1 to 3” thick.
	* Struts are mostly useless.
* Materials: 3 steel ingots, 2 lb arcanum, and 6 buckets of lava.
* Settings: temperature = 6, chthonic energy = 1, phase = 1.

C. Plating Mold
* Mold: 2 rectangular molds for hull plating, each some 2’ wide by 4’ high by 1” thick. 
	* The product is a surprisingly light (6 lb) sheet that.  With a handle, it would serve as a large shield +1.
* Materials: 4 steel ingots, 2 lb of arcanum, and 8 buckets of lava.
* Settings: temperature = 8, chthonic energy =1, phase = 2.

D. Fuel Cell Mold
* Mold: An 8’-long, 3’-deep mold for creating fuel cells. 
	* A metal cylinder filled with a highly dangerous semi-liquid distillate of arcanum.  If punctured, explodes for 6d6, 30’ radius (save for half) and causes a roll on one of the arcanum charts (see 4-153).
* Materials: 10 steel ingots, 10 lb of arcanum, 20 buckets of lava.
* Settings: temperature = 4; chthonic energy = 3; phase = 5.

E. Teleportation Plates
* Beneath the normal silver ‘recipe’ plate is a second silver plaque with an additional 13 glyphs: these detail the unusual properties of this station (e.g., silver instead of steel, spell use, etc.).
* Mold: two 5’-diameter, 1”-deep circles and two 10”x10” squares.
	* A pair of silver teleportation disks attuned to each other.  Deploy where desired to create rudishva teleport nodes.
* Materials 10 lb of molten silver, 10 lb of arcanum, and 4 buckets of lava.
	* Must cast teleport on the product before it finishes cooling.
* Settings: temperature = 3, chthonic energy = 3, phase = 4.

F. Weapons Mold
* The silver plaque has additional glyphs on it, detailing addition of special qualities to the weapons.
	* A drop of rudishva blood: +1d6 to base damage.
	* A drop of any other creature’s blood: +1 to hit and damage vs that creature type.
	* Magical spells cast before cooling: may add further bonuses (GM's choice).
* Molds: 3 rudishva-designed hand weapons (wickedly curved dagger, broadsword, 5’-long barbed spear).
* Materials: (dagger) 1 lb of steel, 1 lb of arcanum, 1 bucket of lava, (sword and spear) 4 lb of steel, 2 lb of arcanum, and 2 buckets of lava.
* Settings: varies slightly by mold, typically in the range of temperature = 5, chthonic energy = 3, phase = 1.

G. Jewelry Mold
* The information plaque here is the most complex, since a number of different formulae were possible.
* Mold:  for several pieces of jewelry, including a ring, a torc, bracelets of varying sizes, and an oval form about 6” long and 2” wide (for rudishva identity plaques).
	* Jewelry produced at the station bestows +1 protection (AC and saves) to the wearer.
	* GM’s choice: could be imbued with other effects by addition of rare parts or spells.
* Material: ½ lb of metal (silver, gold, copper, brass, bronze, platinum, etc.), as well as ½-1 lb of arcanum and 1/4 bucket of lava.
* Settings: varies slightly by mold, typically in the range of temperature = 7, chthonic energy = 3, and phase = 4.

H. Control Rods and Circlets
* Molds: a thick collar and a 3’-long rod with a 4”-diameter circle at one end.
	* A rudishva control rod and collar (new). 
* Materials: 1 steel ingot, 2 lb silver, 3 lb arcanum, 2 buckets lava.
* Settings: temperature = 5; chthonic energy = 3; phase = 2.

5 fire elementals: SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 16, 12(x2), 8(x2); HP 120, 94, 92, 60, 56; #AT 1; Dmg 3-24. Special attacks: combustion. Special defenses: +2 weapons or better to hit.

### 5-90: Intersection

* From the northwest side, the Obsidian Gates appear as described in 5-6d.
	* They open in a similar fashion but do not spawn undead when touched.
	* The Gates lead to an important intersection, littered with bits of gear.
		* Several odd lengths of rope, a rusty pick-axe, two hammers, three panniers filled with granite lumps, a five-foot wooden ladder, a bullseye lantern (without oil), and a copper rudishva identity plaque.

##### 5-90a: Fiery Force Wall and Fiery Dancer

* Entrance to 5-92 is impeded by a fiery force shield.
	* The flame is broken by an 8’-tall, 4’-wide oval in which a holographic figure (two legged, six armed (holding drum, pot of fire, lotus, and dagger; an nothing in two hands), standing on one leg.
	* A hazy glimpse of 5-92 is visible through the oval.
	* If approached within 5’, it starts to dance, slowly but swiftly increasing its tempo.
		* After 3 rounds, it begins hurling fire blobs (unerring, 1d6 fire).
		* Presenting an orange, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaque after the figure begins dancing causes it to dematerialize, allowing passage through the oval opening. After a turn, the dancer rematerializes. 
	* The force wall can be destroyed by casting disintegration on it.

##### 5-90b: Running the Gauntlet

* The scorched and desiccated bodies of six bipeds and two carcass creepers lie in the middle of the hallway, slain by one of the few remaining rudishva point defense arrays (tech), mounted on the walls and ceiling at this point in the hall.
	* 2 adventurers, 2 goblins, an Archontean soldier, and an unarmored varumani.
		* The varumani and soldier are quite ancient; the others are more recent.
		* Varumani: troll thegn’s passport (av items); at 1,750 years old, it is incredibly ancient one and would cause comment and envy if presented to the current Thegn.
		* Soldier: equipment is useless, a ring of protection +2 on one finger.
		* Goblins: total of 8 cp, a short sword, and a steel helmet.
		* Adventurer 1: scorched but usable ring mail +1, a long sword, a pouch with 32 sp and 5 gp, and a deep blue spinel (500 gp).
		* Adventurer 2: iron-shod staff, a belt pouch (potions of extra healing and hill giant strength), coin purse (15 gp, 29 sp and 33 cp), a bit of grey plasteel inscribed (Mithric): “3= strange dormitory. 4= danger! one of the survivors”.
			* Refers to the location of teleporters T3 and T4 in 5-91
				* T3 leads to the residential pod of the Beacon (6-124)
				* T4 leads near the residence of the Arena Lord (5-94; he is the ‘dangerous survivor’).
* Six hardened beads of crystal are attached to the walls and ceiling.
	* Motion within 5’ of a plane described by these beads causes the array to activate.
	* +10 attack, 1.5 attacks per round, 6d6 damage (prevents regeneration).
		* Due to age, 10% chance per shot that it just sputters harmlessly.
	* Cannot be disengaged by mechanical means.
	* Wearing or presenting a plastic rudishva identity plaque (any color) prevents activation.

## Level 5: 91 - 105

### 5-91: The Midnight Road

* The Midnight Road once trembled to the march of the rudishva and their servitor races.
* Describing an arc from the Obsidian Gates (5-6d) to the Great Pillar (5-138), the Road is 20’ wide and 40’ tall.
	* Like the rest of this portion of the Halls, it is sheathed in blacaliyanik granite and lacks any 90-degree angles.
	* At eye level a 3’-tall frieze of complex and busy sculpture runs along both walls of the Midnight Road, covering every inch of space.
		* It was once polychromed (only fragments remain) and depicts a bewildering variety of unusual beings.
			* Most common are tall, skinny bipeds with small horns (rudishva) who direct, command, beat, slay, and otherwise dominate a range of other creatures.
			* This sculptural style features writhing, sinuous figures in constant movement, surrounded by flowers and other decorative elements.

Frieze Scenes
* No true repetition, but many similar scenes.  Doesn't seem narrative; more like a big mural celebrating the allied civilization in Arden Vul.
* Individual race scenes
	* Varumani: gathered in raucous-looking rallies.  Battle training.  Fighting or wrestling contests as other Varumani look on and cheer.  Feasting.  Hunting monsters in mushroom forests.
	* Varuda: congregations on perches (hard to guess if speaking, debating, singing, etc).  Flying.  Swooping down upon monsters.  Playing aerial sports.
	* Kaliyani: ceremonial gatherings (worship? summoning?), often featuring a hovering Ouroboros-like symbol or being.  Kaliyani relaxing in baths.
	* Rudishva: gathered at podiums, discussing, overseen by a rudishva in a big fancy chair.  Constructing tech and doing research.  A team in tactical armor advances, lightcasters raised.
* Mixed scenes
	* Rudishva, varumani, kaliyani, and varuda battling an army of heqeti, slimes, toad demons and other monstrosities.  The heqeti are shown either in general battle or being driven / defeated.  (a particularly common motif around the Obsidian Gates)
		* The rudishva use lightcasters and similar tech weapons (you see occasional spherical or humanoid constructs with them).  Varuda and varumani use a mix of tech weapons and swords / spears / etc.  Kaliyani use some bows and spears / swords, but often shown hurling magic.
	* Varuda flying ahead of bands of rudishva explorers / travelers.
	* Rudishva observing kaliyani magic rituals.
	* Rudishva and kaliyani doing research.
	* Rudishva orating to assembled varuda.
	* Rudishva examining a varumani lying on a tech-platform, or observing a varumani emerging from a pool of liquid.

### 5-92: Translocation Hub

* This brightly lit and impressive chamber served as a main hub of the rudishva teleportation system.
	* Clad in white marble without any 90-degree angles, and illuminated by a series of continual light spells cast on its 30’-tall ceiling.
	* Six semi-circular niches line the walls.
		* Each niches closest to 5-90 contains a stone nataraja (rudishva animated construct).
			* Each balances on one leg with four arms arrayed in a nimbus around its body; one arm holds a scimitar, one holds a small drum, one a fire pot, and the fourth is empty.
			* The head is carved in a rictus of a grin, with almond-shaped eyes, pointed ears, two small horns, and a round pillbox cap.
			* They ignore anyone entering through the oval fiery door (5-90), but attack anyone not bearing a plastic rudishva identity plaque (sky blue, pale green, pink, orange, silver, yellow) steps from one of the teleport nodes.
		* The other four niches contain teleport nodes of the rudishva network.
			* Each is a 5’-diameter silvery circle inset in the floor, with a 10”x10” square of the same material affixed to the wall, labeled with a numeric glyph.
			* Touching the glyph while on the circle activates teleportation.
				* T1: access to 5-94 (cloister)
				* T2: access to 5-132 (troll pits)
				* T3: access to 6-124 (residential pod)
				* T4: access to 6-95A (arena area)
	* Three daises occupy the center of the room. 
		* Dais 1 (southeast): tmain dais is 3’ tall, within which sits sits a secondary raised platform of black obsidian, 5’ square and 3’ tall, pitted, chipped and scorched.
			* Badly damaged and inoperable since the last desperate days of the rudishva.
		* Dais 2 (center, Holographic Announcements): the square dais is 3’ tall, within which is a second raised square (3’ tall) of red obsidian (flecked with black).
			* A holographic information system to convey important announcements to those arriving in the translocation hub.
			* It currently presents only one announcement, recorded as the rudishva hegemony came crashing down (activated by motion within 10’).
				* An orange jumpsuited rudishva appears and says (Rudishva): “Fellow crewmembers of the Shining Beacon! The alien slime-mongers have infiltrated our defenses. The varuda nests are corrupted and have been quarantined by order of Captain Leil-Jor. The loyal varumani gather to repel the hopping hordes. Report to your designated crisis station in the weapons pod or crew chamber. Await further orders. Remain calm, for the Beacon shall light the way!” 
		* Dais 3 (northwest, Scrying Pool): this half-oval dais occupies the northwest end of the hall, raised 5’ off the floor.  A 4’-tall and 8’-diameter basin within is filled with an emerald green liquid.
			* Along the basin are 24 silver panels (3” square) each with a distinct rune.
				* Placing two fingers on one of the rune-squares causes the liquid to roil briefly before presenting a vivid image of that location.
				* The perspective is that of an eye panning slowly in a 360-degree arc.
			* Only the following locations are still operative:
				* Panel #3: area 5-94 (cloister)
				* Panel #5: area 5-107 (plaza of the varuda)
				* Panel #6: area 5-138 (Great Pillar)
				* Panel #11: area SL6-2 (drowned canyon – this view  in effect shows the entirety of the canyon area)
				* Panel #14: area SL7-2 (flooded vaults)
				* Panel #15: area 6-68 (arena area)
				* Panel #19: area 7-4 (floating garden)
				* Panel #21: area SL2-2 (cryogenic storage)
				* Panel #23: area 5-35 (Sundered Span)
				* Panel #24: areas 10-32 to 10-35 (Ziggurat of Kauket)

2 rudishva animated constructs - stone natarajas (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58, 51; #AT 1; Dmg 4-11; MR 25%. Special attacks: sonic or fire attack. Special 
defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold, fire, electricity, poison, and mind-affecting spells.

### 5-93: Empty Staging Room

* The walls are sheathed in blue granite.
* A 3’-diameter hole in the northwest wall (some 7’ up the wall) leads toward 5-101.

### 5-94: The Cloister

* This beautiful site was the spiritual center of rudishva rule in Arden Vul.
* The cloister proper consists of a central area ringed by a set of slim porphyry columns.
	* Within is a low basin and fountain surrounded by the desiccated husks of a number of exotic plant species.
		* Among the debris still thrives a large, yellow-flowered assassin vine (new).
	* The ceiling within the columns is conical, rising some 30’ above the floor; it is painted black with numerous yellow dots (stars).
		* A continual light spell at the apex sheds soft yellow light on the former garden.
	* Between the columns and the walls is a 10’-wide and 15’-tall aisle floored in blue granite, upon which the rudishva used to stroll, converse, and machinate.
* A teleport node is found in the niche in the northeast corner, activated in the usual way.
	* T1: access to 5-92 (Hub)
* Graffiti: Vandals incised a few bits of graffiti in hard-to-examine corners of the cloister.
	* It takes 1 turn of careful searching to turn up a piece of graffiti, of which a maximum of 12 may be found: 
* Secret Door (southwest): difficult to find (1 in 8) from within the cloister
	* Opens when a plastic rudishva identity plaque (any color but rust) is waived across a small red oval inset in the nearby wall.

1 assassin vine (see new monsters): SZ S (effective); AL N; AC 8 (main plant), 4 (tendrils); HD 8 (main plant); HP 53 (main plant), 5 (tendrils); #AT 24; Dmg special. Special attacks: drag; 
strangulation; digestion.


D12 Graffiti GM Notes

1
Psalor-Ki was here (Rudishva)

Refers to the last rudishva child born in AV before the collapse, a being who still lives as the crazed vivisectionist (5-74)

2 Grev-Kilj loves the meat-sacks too much (Rudishva)

12
Beware the flooded halls, for our deranged friend has taken over and is highly dangerous! (Rudishva)

A cryptic reference to Reiv-Tor in the Flooded Vaults (SL7-23)

### 5-95: Treasury

* Formerly the site of unimaginable wealth in technology, sorcery, and precious metal, the rudishva treasury was largely dispersed in the chaotic days after the rudishva collapse.
* The rudishva iris door opens when presented a rudishva identity plaque (pale green, pink, orange, silver or yellow).
* A 4’-tall frieze runs along the walls at eye level is carved with elaborately sinuous images.
	* Spindly figures (rudishva) direct the labors and bearing of valuables by what look like trolls (varumani), bipedal birds (varuda), snakes with legs (kaliyani).
* Inside, racks for equipment, of both plasteel and baroquely wrought iron, occupy one side of the room, and three huge coffers (5’x5’x5’) line the other.
	* All that’s left of the impressive treasury is the following:
		* A broken laser rifle, numerous frayed wires protruding from a split casing
		* A malfunctioning laser pistol.
			* Looks operative but explodes for 2d6 when a rudishva lesser power supply is inserted and the pistol is operated.
		* A spear entirely of wood (no iron tip) that seems decorative.
			* Actually an enchanted spear named Marrow-Drainer (new).
		* 10 bars (25 lbs each) of solid silver (1250 gp each) and 10 bars of steel (3 gp).
			* Previous looters deemed them too heavy to transport.
		* 2 partly smashed and completely inoperative lesser power supplies
* Standing in the corner is an invisible, 6’-tall, hollow gold statue of a human in archaic imperial field plate armor.
	* The statue very realistic.  Gnaicus Furicus was a legionary during the first tentative period of Archontean expansion (2,000 years ago), turned to gold.  How he got here is a mystery.
	* 40,000 gp as a statue (30,000 gp just for the metal), 600 lb.
	* Because the statue is invisible, previous looters missed it.
* Secret Door (south): difficult (1 in 8) to locate, opens by manipulating a rudishva figure on the frieze.
	* Within is an oval chamber with a teleport node (T11: access to 7-144))
* One-Way Door (north, from 5-95a): detectable from the main treasury, but cannot be opened from the south.

Gnaicus Furicus, 4th-level Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 41; #AT 1; Dmg 3-8 (short sword +1). Abilities: STR 16, INT 8, WIS 11, DEX 11, CON 17, CHA 15. 
* Possessions: imperial field plate; short sword +1; purse with 33 ancient silver pennies, 19 ancient gold solidi, and 3 ancient octagonal platinum coins.
* He speaks only Mithric.

### 5-95a: Secure Treasury

* The rudishva captain, Leil-Jor, created this chamber to store certain dangerous items away from the eyes of the rest of the hegemony.
	* It can only be accessed from a teleport node in the chamber of the Beacon (SL14-8), and use of that node requires one of two special yellow rudishva identity plaques (located at 5-98 and 9-96).
* Inventory
	* A set of keys (one gold and one platinum) to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D)
	* The horn taken from the interior of the heqeti ziggurat (10-37)
		* Necessary to summon Kauket, the demon prince (see intro text to Level 10).
	* A rudishva useful palm (palm of the cleansing wind)
	* A tactical suit
	* 7 structural mines
	* 6 bottles of pep pills with 20 pills per bottle
	* A point defense array and a portable point defense controller (tech).
	* An airtight seed bank (4’x6’) containing seed specimens for 1,800 species of plants from the rudishva homeworld
	* Data crystals (tech) with full and detailed instructions on how to use the fire pits of creation (5-89) and the troll pits (5-131 and 5-132).
* One-way Door (south): a rudishva iris door in the south wall leads to the main treasury.
	* Opens to a yellow rudishva identity plaque. Can't be opened from the main treasury.
* Teleport Node: has the usual silver disk, but the 10”-square wall plaque is golden metal.
	* Requires touching a yellow rudishva identity plaque to the golden square.
	* T25: access to Sub-Level 14 (SL14-8)

### 5-96: Cells

* These three temporary living chambers are identical.
	* Each holds a bunk bed made of greyish plasteel, a 5’-tall desk/table, a stone chest (empty), and a wall-mounted silver ‘mirror’ (actually a defunct view-screen).
	* No linens are present.

### 5-97: Library

* The rudishva resource library is dominated by the unusual bookshelves that line the curved west wall.
	* Most of the contents of the library were looted in the distant past.
	* These shelves carved from the rock are narrower and deeper than usual, as if made for 1’-diameter cylinders.
		* Almost completely empty, with only 3 cylinders remaining (1' diameter, 2' long).
		* Inside each is a scroll of an unusual linen-like ‘paper’, very strong and durable.
		* Scrolls: the Time of Darkened Skies, the Properties of Arcanum, the Betrayal. 
	* Round-edged triangular tables occupy the south and north ends of the room; 8’ on a side, 5’ high, and made of walnut.
		* On the north table is an unfinished manuscript in parchment, which attempts a translation of 250 key words of Rudishva Glyphis into Mithric.
			* Use by one fluent in Mithric provides a 33% chance of comprehending a simple rudishva text written in Glyphis.  The proportion of a text that may be understood is 1d4+1 x 10%.
	* Between the tables and perpendicular to the entrance door is a pair of desks, back to back, with hoods covering their sides and tops, resembling microfilm readers.
		* Each is a GnuCoder 5000 Full-Immersion Sensory Experience (tech).
			* Offers the best in virtual reality when loaded with a data crystal and hooked up to power (a greater power source is needed).
			* One is currently loaded with The Lament of the Beacon (books).

### 5-98: Chapter House

* The walls are of black granite, inset with chips of yellow crystal in a pattern (a star map of the rudishva home system).
	* In the center of this large room is a low (3’) dais supporting a heavy grey plasteel chair, able to rotate 360, with wide armrests with several glyph-labeled buttons.
		* In the chair is the skeleton of an 8’-tall biped in a blue jumpsuit (Leil-Jor) .
			* Silver rudishva identity plaque and a special yellow plaque (captain’s card) to access the bridge of the Beacon (SL14-10) via the teleporter T24.
		* The buttons could activate various systems analyses, mostly now defunct.
			* The glyph “Seeing” still works; projecting a grainy holo feed of one of a few locations: Cryogenic storage (SL2-2), Weapons locker (6-27), Engine room (7-143),  Bridge (SL14-10), Shuttle bay (SL13-37), Ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-35)
* In an oval around the chair are twenty-five 5’-tall podiums, each formed from an iron bar and a grey plasteel console.
	* The podiums appear as overly tall writing desks with an oval mirror on each.

* In the confident days after the crash of the Beacon, Captain Leil-Jor held regular meetings here to organize the rudishva efforts to locate needed materials and organize the repair of the Beacon.
* Infected by a heqeti slime, she died here attempting to organize a defense of the rudishva domains shortly after the heqeti and kaliyani surprise attack; in the chaos of the collapse, her body was never removed.

### 5-99: Cave with Hole Leading Up to 3-114

* This natural cave's floor is sandy and relatively flat.
* A 5’-diameter hole in the ceiling leads up 250’ to 3-114.

### 5-100: Watch Cave w/ Access to Levels 6 and 7

* A patrol of Set guardsmen led by a Set acolyte guards this important crossroads cavern.
	* Ordered down the hole in 5-99 to watch and defend from incursions below, this patrol is nervous about being so far from home.  As a result, the acolyte is more likely to negotiate than fight.
* Two tunnels exit the cave, one to 6-166 and the other to 7-137.
	* The Setites scouted as far as 6-166, where the pukel-mander frightened them back to Level 5.

4 Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 2nd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 18, 17, 15, 12; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow).

wounds, curse (reverse of bless), protection from good; hold person, silence 15’ radius.

### 5-101: Mist-filled Cavern of Doom

* A thick, purplish mist fills both of the tunnels that approach this location, beginning about 20’ from the cave entrances.
	* Bizarre, unsettling sounds - cackling, clicking, and alien, two-toned grunting – become audible to anyone who enters the mist.
* Corpses of six Set guardsmen and a Set deacon are splayed unnaturally within the mist of the north tunnel; all severely lacerated and missing eyeballs and hands.
	* 79 sp, 31 gp, a deacon’s was stick (new), six maces, and a mace +1.
* The body of the explorer who found this back route to the rudishva halls lies in the center of the cave, where she was slain centuries ago by piercers.
	* An unstoppered brass ewer (jug of purple mist, new) beside the explorer’s body emits the purple mist.
	* On corpse: 47 gp, 31 sp, a scroll of protection from magic; a soapstone figurine of a heqeti (75 gp to an antiquarian)
		* A brass figurine of a six-armed horror (the rending demon, 335 gp)
			* A 12 x 12 grid of Archontean (Mithric?) letters etched on the figurine.  Contains the demon's name, Neeralbab; a sage or 6d6 under INT to decipher it.
* A rending demon (new) lurks above, clutching the ceiling and waiting for more victims.
	* It is deranged, bound by the explorer's figurine, even after their death.
		* The contract will be broken if the master’s body or figurine is destroyed.
	* 1-in-4 that the demon gibbers or grunts loudly in anticipation of prey (alerting potential victims); otherwise it has +2 surprise.

1 rending demon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 0; MV 120’, 60’ climbing; HD 7+7; HP 50; #AT 4; Dmg 2-7/2-7/2-7/2-7; MR 40%. Constant abilities: infravision.
* Special attacks: surprise on 4 in 6; rend (3d6) if three claws hit; cone of cold (1/day); darkness 10’ radius.
* Special defenses: 90% undetectable; +2 or better weapons to hit. Special: levitation; dispel magic; detect illusion; detect invisible; teleport without error; gate (33% chance).

### 5-102: River Cave

* A section of sandy beach runs along both sides of the river.
* Washed up on one side is a broken egg-shaped vessel originally 8’ long and 6’ wide (see 4-85).
	* The vessel is damaged beyond repair, but its fish-shaped stabilizing control rod is still intact and could be used to operate the vessels that remain in 4-85.

### 5-103: Base of Whirlpool, w/ access to SL12-1

* The whirlpool at 4-65 debouches here in a roaring and foaming column of water.
	* Barring powerful magic, it is impossible ascend the 100’-tall shaft to 4-65.
* The cave is 60’ tall, except where the whirlpool has made it 80’ tall.
	* The water is 50’ deep, leaving a 10’-tall air pocket above the water.
	* Two tunnels exit from the cave.
		* The normal course of the river flows off to the south.
		* The second (15’ in diameter) is at the northeast edge of the pool, leading to Kerbog Khan's domain (SL12-1).

### 5-104: Slime Preparation Chamber, w/ access to 3-117

* This innocuous-seeming cave holds an infamous reputation among the heqeti, the rudishva, and others, as the site where the heqeti and kaliyani launched the deadly attack that overthrew the rudishva hegemony.
	* A crouching pukel-mander (new) squats in the worked northern extension.
	* To the west is an open, sandy area of floor.
	* On the ceiling, 30’ above, is the opening to the well leading up 200’ to 3-117.
	* To the east, the river from 5-103 rushes southeast towards the varuda nests.
* The central feature of the chamber is an enormous pool (20' diameter, 10' deep) of roiling and burping slimes of different colors and consistencies.
	* It holds several noxious slimes extruded by Rimmaq-Isfet itself and imported from the Abyss for use as biological agents against the rudishva and their servants.
	* Two moldy heqeti warrior corpses lie near the pool, as do five 2' long oval containers.
		* The ovals are made of a grey-brown chitinous substance, with a porous membrane on one end. 
			* A slime was scooped into the container, then thrown as a projectile or cast into the river where the slime would gradually leak through the membrane to poison drinking water.
	* The pool is constantly active, reabsorbing existing slimes into the base matter and extruding new slimes.
		* At any given moment 4-7 heqeti slimes are visible on the surface of the pool.
		* Each hour, 75% one slime is replaced by 1-2 new ones.
	* Slimes are quiescent until removed from the pool, at which point they will, if not contained, act according to their basic function (see below).

### 5-105: Back Stair

* This secret staircase and corridor is oval in shape and only 6’ tall.
* The channel of the underground river that flows through the widened area is only 3’ in diameter leading north, but 5’ in diameter heading southeast.
* Secret Door (northeast): easy to find (1 in 4) from within the back stair.
	* Opens to any plastic rudishva identity plaque besides rust waived across a small red oval inset in the nearby wall.
* Secret Door (southwest): easy to find (1 in 4) from within the back stair.
	* Opens by sliding the oval stone panel to the left.

## Level 5: 106 - 120

### 5-106: Stripped Chamber

* A former administrative center.
	* The corpse of an Archontean legionary lies across the threshold, legs and torso flattened as by some terrific force (GM: the varuda guardian at 5-107).
		* The soldier’s armor is crushed and useless, his other possessions long gone.
	* The chamber once had a 3’-tall frieze at eye level, but it was ripped out several millennia ago, leaving only an ugly gash in the blue granite walls.
	* All of the chamber’s original furnishings as gone.
		* A Nutri-vore 2000 (tech) rests in the niche on the eastern wall.
			* Requires a rudishva lesser power supply for operation.
			* Scrawled in red paint (Mithric) next to it: “Hands off! Property of Psalor-Ki. Thieves will be tracked and punished.”
				* GM Note: Psalor-Ki (5-74) wrote this centuries ago, when he was still sane; he has utterly forgotten its existence.
	* Secret Door (south): when a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque is placed into a slot lying just above the stripped frieze, an oval portion of wall slides aside, revealing a teleport node.
		* T10: access to 6-37 (near the Weapons Module)

### 5-107: Plaza of the Varuda

* An imposing plaza, with a 60’ octagonally vaulted ceiling and blue-granite sheathing on the walls.  Several doors, a pool, and a huge statue line the walls of this important junction-point on the Midnight Road.
	* The corpses of four dwarven explorers lie battered and smashed on the floor of the otherwise smooth and dust-free plaza. 
		* 4 suits of silver-chased steel chain mail (2x value, dwarven-sized); two war hammers, a battle axe, and a pick +2
		* 3 red spinels (250 gp each), a silver plate (110 gp) incised with 3 images: varuda (winged being), varumani (troll), and kaliyani (snake-headed being)
		* A partial map to Zhorak’s Forge (8-100), incised on a rectangular piece of copper, with an inscription (Dwarven / cult of Ptah). 
			* ‘Lord Zhorak made his home near the bottom of the chasm. Find the hall with the six basalt columns, then use the appropriate red circle.’
			* The ‘map’ shows two rows of four circles each; the third circle in the top row has an ‘x’ scratched through it.
			* GM: refers to 8-7, with its 6 pillars and 8 portals. Indicates the proper one for Zhorak’s Forge (8-7c), but no warning these are one-way portals.
		* A scrap of parchment scrawled with (Archontean) “The chamber is near the cat god’s shrine.”
	* A huge (20' tall) varuda statue stands to the northeast, crouching on its powerful legs, wings cocked in a halo above its head.
		* Still bears much of its paint, with yellow wings, blue head, brown body, and silver talons.
		* Actually a rudishva animated construct,  the varuda guardian (new).
	* Pool: along the northwest wall is a 3’-tall semi-circular pool magically ever-full with cool, clear water.
	* West door (to 5-108): reinforced wood, destroyed massive force (the varuda guardian), its fragments swing on bent hinges.
		* Two human skeletons in chain mail lie just inside the entrance.
	* Southwest door (to 5-110) oval and stone; a ½” bright yellow sensor at its center.
		* Opens to a pale green, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaque.
	* South door (to 5-111): wooden, locked.
		* A rudishva wall of force blocks the tunnel beyond.
			* Can be destroyed by disintegration, doesn't respond to identity plaques.  It doesn't have a fiery dancer (as 5-90a).
		* Opening the wooden door causes the varuda guardian to attempt to close the door or to destroy the passageway; attacking anyone who gets in the way.

The Varuda Guardian Statue
* It lumbers to life when any movement enters its field of vision.
* Swift display of any plastic rudishva identity plaque placates it, otherwise it springs after intruders in short, but well-directed hops, buffeting them with its powerful wings and emitting ear-shattering cries.
	* It attacks varuda on sight, regardless of their plaques, since its final instructions were to maintain the quarantine of the infected varuda nests (5-108 and 5-111).
* It pursues intruders from 5-90b all the way to the barrier at 5-120.
	* If antagonized, it continues to pursue intruders through the gap in the barricade and all the way to the doors at 5-138.
	* Its size prevents it from entering most side chambers.
	* After 2 turns with no intruders visible, it returns to its original place.

1 rudishva animated construct - varuda guardian (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 0; MV 60’; HD 10; HP 70; #AT 2; Dmg 2-12/2-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: cry (paralysis or sonic 
damage). Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold, fire, electricity, poison and mind-affecting spells.
* 1 per 3 rounds, emit shriek: 60' cone to either save vs petri or paralyzed for 2-3 rounds, OR 2d6 sonic (save vs spells for half)
* If cracked open, there is a watermelon-sized lump of arcanum (8-fist-sized pieces) where the heart would be.

### 5-108: Brood-Nests of the Elder Varuda

* A 40' tall main cave, with a river, small pool, a sandy area dotted with odd-looking lumps.
	* Brightly lit in its central section by a continual light spell.
	* Six smaller caves open from the north, south, and west walls off the main cavern, their mouths located between 20’ and 30’ above the main floor.
		* The caves are significantly hotter and more humid than the larger cave, and are uniformly dark and rocky.
		* Each cave has 10-30 of projections (perches), usually found in front of a semi-circular depression roughly scraped from the rock (an egg-nest).
			* The egg-nests are empty, save for fragments of leathery varuda eggs.
	* The cave marked ‘C’ also contains:
		* Just within the cave are the remains of 2 varuda (not slimed) scorched by fire.
			* Raalk's crazed lieutenants killed him for the rebreather which had allowed him to survive the slime-toxin attack, but were cut down in return.
			* 6 silver rods (½” diameter and 6” long, 50 gp each), a rudishva dart thrower and clip of 6 immobilizing darts (tech).
		* In the center is the body of Raalk, a great varuda leader, pierced with six 1’-long darts.
			* Rudishva breather; lesser power supply; laser rifle w/ another lesser power supply (half full, pale green and platinum rudishva identity plaques, 25 small amethysts (50 gp each).
		* The bodies all wear finely woven shorts and unusual tunics, with sets of belts slung across shoulders and hips.
	* Numerous niches carved in the walls between the cave-mouths.
	* The northern niche is sheathed with smooth blue granite, leading to the incubator and food supply (5-109).
		* A 4’ x 3’ smooth black ‘glass’ (defunct view-screen) is set in the wall.
		* An spidery inscription (Semi-glyphik) runs across the top of the wall: “Varuda! We soar ahead of the rest! We locate the enemy! We report! We always serve with faithful loyalty.”
	* The area is quiet and smells slightly of a blend of ripe fruit and decay.
	* The river rushes into the cavern from a 5’-diameter tunnel located at the northeast edge of the cavern.
		* A thin, very strong mesh covers the tunnel opening.  On the far side of the mesh (towards 5-104), a 2’-long cylinder knocks against the mesh. 
		* Although it was the delivery mechanism for the heqeti slime-toxins, the river is now perfectly clean and potable.
		* Remnants of plasteel and ordinary steel apparatuses - all eaten away by some sort of rust - dot the flat area on either side of the river.
	* The water of the pool is clean and clear.
		* Forty skeletons of winged bipeds lie jumbled on its bottom.
			* Among the skeletons is another empty 2’ cylinder of some strange chitin (5-104), as well as 4 inoperable laser rifles, 3 inoperable laser pistols, 20 ceremonial bronze daggers, two iolites (75 gp each), an aquamarine (500 gp), a huge pink pearl (1,500 gp), and a large violet garnet (worth 500 gp).
	* East of the pool is a sandy area dotted with 10 oddly colored, man-sized lumps.
		* The lumps range in color from burnt orange to rust, all appear slightly ‘furry’.
		* They were once varuda that became heqeti slime zombies (new) during the heqeti attack.  They rise and shamble to the attack if they sense movement beyond the stairwell to 5-107.

GM Note
* The heqeti attack against the rudishva, abetted by kaliyani treachery, began in this cave.
* From the slime cave (5-104), the heqeti cast deadly toxins into the river where they washed up against the mesh filter; the slimes oozed through the porous membrane of their delivery canisters and into the river.
* One variety of slime-toxin took gaseous form and infected the varuda immediately, maddening them with thirst and killing them within hours.
* Other, slower forms, crept through the tunnels to assault the rudishva themselves, while still other slimes animated dead varuda corpses to fight against their masters.
* Most of the varuda leadership was slain in the first onslaught, and, seeing their doom, the udishva imposed swift and severe measures: all varuda fleeing the area were stopped and killed by the stone guardian (5-107), while the secondary varuda nests (5-111) were quarantined permanently.

10 heqeti slime zombies (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 4; HP 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 26, 25, 25, 24, 23; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: slime infestation. Special defenses: immune to electricity.
* Vuln to fire (+1 per die)
* Slime infestation: on hit, save vs poison or take 1d4 per round until death, d6 fire destroys it

### 5-109: Food, Incubator, and Teleportation

* A small complex of rounded, oval rooms providing necessities to the varuda.
	* The walls are white marble, rounded to eliminate 90-degree angles.
	* A 4’-tall oval counter is surrounded by 16 food stations.
		* Station: silver oval inset into the counter, a curved yellow tube curving from the counter out over the plate, 6 colored buttons in the edge of the console.
			* The buttons causes the nozzle to spurt one of six varieties of high-protein, high-vitamin food paste (not very appetizing, highly nutritious).
* To the west is the incubator room, where premature hatchlings were kept warm and safe.
	* A 4’-tall table occupies the center.  A cowling over it provides heat and light.
		* Six tiny varuda skeletons lie in the incubator.
* The two teleport nodes were disabled following the release of the slime toxins, but could be re-activated from 5-110 and 5-118.
	* T5: access to 5-118 (Armory) (currently inoperable)
	* T6: access to 5-110 (currently inoperable)
		* cleared

### 5-110: Varuda Training Grounds

* This dark, 40’-tall vaulted chamber was used to train varuda units in aerial combat.
	* The expanse is studded with 3’-diameter pedestals varying in height from 2’ to 10’.
	* Projecting from the walls at varying heights (from 10’ to 35’) are stone ledges.
		* A backpack was left on one of the ledges, 25’ up the north wall. 
			* Two 50’ coils of rope, 1 iron ration, 3 vials of powerful poison, a potion of extra healing, 3 empty bags (one is a bag of holding, smallest capacity).
	* Light reveals an enormous mural of an attacking varuda painted across the ceiling.
	* A small oval corridor to the west leads to two teleport nodes.
		* The rudishva disabled these nodes as soon as they realized the extent of the heqeti attack.  A marble slab lays across each of the silver floor-pads and a  panel of clear plastic is glued across the wall-mounted hand-pads.
		* The pads will operate if the blockages are removed.
		* T6: access to 5-109 (currently inoperable)
			* cleared
		* T7: access to 5-111 (currently inoperable)
			* actually this is T8
	* The iris door to 5-114 opens if approached w/in 5'

### 5-111: Nests of the Younger Varuda

* Although quite similar to 5-108, this cave complex is inhabited by a debased, low-tech tribe of primitive varuda, isolated in this cavern for close to three millennia, surviving on protein paste and purified water.
	* They have lost most of their higher knowledge (including written language) and technological ability. 
* The varuda are fierce, primitive bird-men.
	* They value cocky display and disdain weakness and retreat.   They love to fight ritual duels to establish precedence.
	* They don't need to hunt or gather due to the still-functioning food processors at 5-112, so most of their time is spent roosting, debating precedence, and engaging in mostly-symbolic (non-lethal) single-combat.
	* They worship two ‘gods’, Lilja (the obelisk) and Raalk (in the shrine), and are aware of the great evil, a being called “Yeeni” (a corruption of ‘kaliyani’).
	* They are aware of the Midnight Road, but terrified of the giant stone bird (5-107) and so have not dared much exploration.
	* They have explored 5-121 and 5-122, and have heard voices from 5-127 and 5-131.
* They negotiate with outsiders (those able to communicate), and are eager to acquire new ‘artifacts of Raalk’ (meaning anything not made in their cave).
	* The best way to win their friendship is to destroy, or show proof of the destruction of, the varuda guardian.  The perpetrators will become trusted allies.
	* The varuda will begin to explore beyond their nests, but due to their cripplingly conservative and ritualistic culture, it will be slow and halting.

* The central cave is dominated by a continual light on the 50’-tall ceiling; this overlooks the river, the pool, the obelisk, and the sandy area surrounding the obelisk.
	* Dark openings dotting the walls lead to the nesting grounds of the six clans of varuda.
	* In the past twenty years seismic activity has opened a hole in the eastern-most sub-cave, allowing access to 5-119a.
* The river is cool and clean, as is the pool.
	* A mesh gate where the river enters the cave is connected to a small purifier.  This prevented the ancestors of these varuda from infection by toxic slimes.
	* At the bottom of the pool are rusted and inoperable remains of several dozen rudishva weapons and other technological devices.
		* They were cast off over the centuries by decreasingly competent varuda as the devices failed (or power supplies expired).
		* 1 pale green and 3 bronze, 5 copper rudishva identity plaques.
* The debased varuda gather among the sands of the south bank of the river for ritualized mini-wars (a relic of their ancient military training), and to genuflect to the obelisk.
	* The square obelisk is 15’ high and 4' on a side, with a defunct black glass viewsceen on each side.
		* Carved images of varuda flying and shooting darts at misshapen amphibian-like things cover the sides up to a height of 4’.
		* Primitive pictures are daubed on the screens in blood and other fluids, thereby to wake their god.
	* The varuda recall the obelisk as a now-silent but once-potent god “Lilja” (Leil-Jor, the captain of the Beacon, 5-98).
* The worked north passage (to 5-107) has blue granite sheathing, painted with faded remains of ancient frescoes
	* They were painted there by the first generations of varuda in a desperate attempt not to forget their identity.
	* The frescoes show many varuda marching, flying, and fighting giant salamander-like things, and a single varuda beseeching a tall, skinny, horned biped.
	* A faint inscription under the latter scene reads (Semi-glyphik), “Raalk begs Leil-Jor to release the people.”
	* Above the frescoes is faintly inscribed, “The varuda were faithful, as always. Unaware of the nature of their transgression, they await the call of their beloved masters, ready to do penance. They shall be ready.”
* At the end of the passage a shimmering wall of force blocks access to the door to 5-107.

* The seven sub-caves which line the main cavern are home to 60 primitive varuda (18 elders and 42 mature adults) divided into six clans, each claiming a cave as its primary nesting place.
	* Clans: Kreaw (shrine-keepers, cave A), Verrik (cave F), ??? (cave ??), ??? (cave ???), ??? (cave ???), ??? (cave ???).

Default Cave
* All but one of the caves are ordinary living-quarters, littered with old egg fragments, guano, and a handful of primitive bone and stone utensils.
* Typically occupied with nesting females, watchful males, and the frequent sound of wings flapping, beaks snapping, and guttural cries echoing across the cave.

Cave A
* The Kreaw clan inhabits this cave, custodians of the shrine to Raalk (below).
* They have the last 3 operative dart throwers (w/ 5 clips containing 25 ordinary darts).
* The elders of clan Kreaw are most likely to be asked to negotiate with visitors. 

Cave C
* The largest cave, and property of no clan.
* Several dozen oval plasteel containers of various sizes are stacked on the roosting ledges.
	* Within these are the ashes of the first several generations of varuda who were imprisoned and died here.
* At the far end of the cave is a hole in the stone floor dropping 15’ to a dead-end cave some 60’ in diameter.
	* When a modern varuda becomes too decrepit to take part in the rituals of daily life, an adult male from each tribe carries the ancient one to this pit tosses him in (still living), where he/she eventually dies.
	* The lower pit is chillingly thick with the bones of millennia of varuda.

Cave F
* The Verrik clan has become influential in the past generation due to their control of the sole access route out of the ancestral cavern.
* The Verriks found a pair of steel short swords in the Midnight Road, which they keep hidden from the rest of the tribe.

Shrine of Raalk
* Once apparent that they were stranded here, the ancient varuda collected all remaining data crystals and power supplies and locked them into a rudishva lockbox.
	* As troll chest, but opens to a brown or better rudishva identity plaque.
	* Inside: pale green rudishva identity plaque, 2 laser pistols, 1 greater rudishva power supply, and 5 lesser power supplies, 4 platinum bars (400 gp each), 6 data crystals, and a set of ivory plaques inscribed with Semi-glyphik.
* Next to the chest is a 4’-tall statuette of a varuda.  Bits of feather, claw, carved bone, etc. hang reverently from the statuette.
	* If the chest touched, the statuette’s eyes glow yellow and a magic mouth intones (Varuda Semi-glyphik) “Children! We have put this wisdom aside. You must wait for Raalk to arrive and bring you back into the favor of Leil-Jor.  Only those who possess proper authority and access may recover our lore.”
	* The modern, primitive, varuda understand only the word “Raalk” and have decided the statuette is Raalk, and that he must be placated.

Ivory Plaques
* Recounts the story of the first generations of quarantined varuda.
- Refers to a mysterious event which caused ‘the Masters’ to quarantine the faithful varuda; it recounts how Raalk spoke only once to the imprisoned ones, counselling patience and promising to sort out the problem.
- It tells of spasmodic and decreasingly frequent video contact from the Masters, urging calm and patience; and it ends with the stark phrase “The kaliyani have betrayed us!”

	* Along the sides of the room are several tattered banners displaying stylized varuda and two corkboards on which are tacked maps of the entire Midnight Road area (except secret doors) and overview maps of Level 6.
	* A broken hole in the north wall leads to a ragged tunnel.
* The entire area is in disarray, with scorch marks on most of the walls, and skeletons slumped over broken consoles.
	* Some skeletons are winged bipeds (varuda), a few charred remains look trollish (i.e., varumani), and a few more are large bipedal salamanders (i.e., heqeti).
	* Ten of the corpses rise as zombies 3 rounds after the chamber is entered.
* Secret Door (northeast): easy to detect (1 in 4), opens by sliding a panel into the wall.

* This enormous room is egg-shaped, with slick, curved, white marble walls.
	* A loud thrum originating to the south echoes off walls.
	* In the center, a massive block of granite rises from the curved walls of the egg.
		* The block is a shell for one of the oldest staircases in the complex, a steep, worn set of stone stairs that lead down 300’ to the Drowned Canyon (SL6-37).
		* The block is connected to corridors on the south, east, and west walls by thin bridges of white marble laid over plasteel.
		* Twenty feet below the bridges, where the walls curve to meet the staircase block, a pile of debris has collected.
			* Mostly random junk, but searching will turn up a potion case with three potions of water breathing, a wickedly-barbed bone spear, and a brown plastic rudishva identity plaque.

##### 5-115a: Corridor Section

* A looting party of six lizardmen is poking around in this section of collapsed hallway.
	* They will negotiate and trade a bit of information, but grow uneasy if too much chatter impedes them from returning down the stairs down to the Drowned Canyon (SL6) in the next room.
	* They know very little about Level 5, but much about the general features of the Drowned Canyon, about the fishmen, and about the southern reaches of Level 4.
	* They would trade such information for food and assistance against the fishmen and/or the colossal eel (SL6-24).

6 lizardmen: SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 2+1; HP 15, 13, 13, 12, 11, 11; #AT 1 or 3; Dmg 1-6 (club) and 1-6 (javelin), or 1-2/1-2/1-8. Possessions: clubs; javelins.
* The lizardmen have an orange plastic rudishva identity plaque, which they used to access the stairs at SL6-37.

Gratak
### 5-116: Fans

* A deafening roar fills the chamber.  Two huge fans set in steel racks flank a 10’-diameter hole in the floor.
	* The hole opens over the Drowned Canyon, drilled to provide air for the rudishva areas of the Halls.
	* The fans labor slightly but are still operable after all the years.  Serious harm could  render them inoperable.
		* The air in most of the area between 5-86 and 5-137 becomes stale and heavy (-1 to hit and damage, natural healing is halved).

### 5-117: Collapsed Area w/ Tunnel Up to 4-117

* This section of rudishva corridor collapsed centuries ago.  A more recent collapse opened a tunnel to Level 4 (4-117).
	* In the entrance to the tunnel lie the corpses of three adventurers, each skewered by short, barbed, bone arrows (lizardmen) 
		* The lizardmen looted the corpses enthusiastically, but had no use for two scrolls (cure serious wounds, fireball).

### 5-118: Armory

* The door to this site is composed of two oval, interlocking slabs of blue granite.
	* On each oval is a red circle of plastic, 3” in diameter.
	* One must press a plastic rudishva identity plaque (brown, sky blue, pale green, pink, orange, silver, or yellow) to either circle to open the door.
		* Presenting a rust plaque causes the door to freeze for 1-3 days (equivalent of a wizard lock spell); during this time even higher value cards will not work.
* The entrance hall contains a grill-like gateway-framework of plasteel 5’ deep and wide enough to admit one medium-sized person at a time.
	* Three motionless, mannikin-like figures stand around a central podium at the entry.
	* Entering the framework triggers a smooth, silky voice (Rudishva) “Produce identification so that we may better serve your weapons needs”.  A passive reddish laser scan sweeps over the entrant.
		* Presenting a rudishva identity plaque (pale green, pink, silver, or yellow) and the voice responds “Thank You. Your tactical advisor has been activated”.  One  of the security constructs (mannikins) activates.
			* A brown, sky blue or orange plaque opens the door, but doesn't allow one through scanner.
		* If not shown the proper plaque, the voice restates “Identification, please!”
		* If still not shown, or if someone rushes through, a deeper voice declaims “Unauthorized access! Unauthorized access! Lethal force has been approved and the authorities have been notified. Remain motionless!”  All three automatons activate and attack. 
* Beyond the scanner is a 25'-tall chamber with numerous white marble racks in which are placed weapons, armor and objects both familiar and unfamiliar.
	* The artifacts are with thick plasteel clips.  Attempts to take them (lift gates to break) cause the constructs to activate and attack.
* Two of the three teleport nodes were disabled in antiquity by placing sheets of marble over the floor plates, and gluing clear plexiglass over the hand plates.
	* Removing them renders them operable once more.
	* T5: access to 5-109 (currently inoperable)
		* reopened
	* T7: access to 5-112 (currently inoperable)
		* reopened
	* T12: access to 5-31
	* The constructs do not activate immediately upon arrival at a teleport node, but wait for one of the proper identity plaques to be displayed.

Security Constructs (mannikins)
* The three figures standing beyond the scanner are rudishva Tactical Advisor model security constructs (new), made of highly articulated steel, plastic, and decaying organic compounds (bad smell).
	* They resemble a rudishva, a varumani, and a varuda, respectively, with high, medium, and low security access.
	* An individual construct will respond with deadly force if attacked, regardless of whether the correct plaque has been displayed.
	* When activated, they ask what item is requested, but then glitch and return a random item (can only have one item checked out at a time).

GM Note: originally there was a kaliyani security construct; it was disabled in the hours immediately after the heqeti attack (thus an orange identity plaque is useless here).

Rudishva Tactical Advisor Construct (silver or yellow, high security access)
* Appearance: a spindly-limbed biped about 7’ tall with a large head; the head bears two small horns, and the mouth has fangs. The construct is dressed in an orange jumpsuit and wears a utility belt.

Varumani Tactical Advisor Construct (pink, medium security access):
* Appearance: heavy, thick-limbed, being 8’ tall, with gnarled features. The construct wears a loincloth and a utility belt.

Varuda Tactical Advisor Construct (pale green, low security access):
* Appearance: a 6’-tall biped with membranes attached between arms and back, a sharp beak, and impressive comb feathers. The construct wears a light-blue tunic.

Available Artifacts in the Armory
* Number in parentheses indicates the number of that artifact in stock.
* optional: 10% chance that any item is still in working order (low availability) or 10% chance of having ceased to function (high but not unlimited access).

### 5-119: Guard Niches

* These four niches (the fifth, 5-119a, has its own key) are located 20’ up the wall of the Midnight Road.
	* Each is an 8’-tall, 5’-deep hemispherical space.
	* In antiquity, a varuda scout kept watch from each niche.
	* Presently, determine the contents of each niche (use each entry only once):

D6 Contents

1
A bundle of 10 torches, inside of which is thrust a walnut wand of magic missiles (14 charges)

2
A leather backpack, with a coil of silk rope, 10 pitons, a hammer, 2 flasks of oil, and a map showing areas 5-90, 5-91, 5-93, 5-107, 5-120 to 5-131, 5-135 and 5-137.

3

6
Nothing

##### 5-119a: Special Guard Niche

* Two primitive varuda warriors from the Verrik clan (see 5-111F), armed with bone spears and short swords, occupy this niche.
	* They hoot threateningly if anyone approaches within 20’, and attack if shown too much deference.  Confident display of strength produces obsequious negotiation or flight.
* At the back of the niche is a 4’-tall and 3’-wide crack leading to a tunnel to 5-111.

2 primitive varuda warriors (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LN; AC 7; MV 90’, 90’ gliding (Class E); HD 2; HP 13, 12; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-4/1-4 or 1-6 (stone club).

### 5-120: Barrier

* A 5’-tall barrier of large chunks of stone mixed with smaller bits of wall sheathing, marble fragments, and bone blocks most of the corridor at this point.
	* Easily climbed, but also features a 6’ opening (which the varuda guardian created and still uses).
	* Two dead adventurers are draped over the barrier towards the west side.
		* Devoid of treasure, and their armor is destroyed.
	* Stuck into the top of the barrier is a broken spear haft tied with a red woolen scarf.
		* Held down by a rock next to the spear haft is a parchment message.
			* (Archontean): “To Hermonion - watch out for the stone guardian that lurks further north, up this broad, tall corridor. It senses movement. I will slip past it and push ahead to the fire pits. Look for me in this location in 2 days. [Signed] the Silent Tempest.”
				* GM Note: this parchment refers to an adventuring party (see 5-126 for info) that worked its way up from the lower levels to 5-125.
* A similar barrier entirely blocks the entrance to 5-121 from the Midnight Road.

## Level 5: 121 - 141

### 5-121: Cistern

* This chamber is 40’ high, with rounded corners.
	* It is bare granite, as the sheathing was stripped long ago.
	* A great open-topped, cubic cistern fills the room, reaching nearly to the ceiling (35’) with a walkway around the outside.
		* A knotted rope is spiked hangs down the west side, spiked at the top.
		* Two adventurers have made a makeshift encampment atop the cistern, spiking their hammocks and gear sacks just inside the lip of the cistern.  Coiled on the lip are two more lengths of rope and two wooden buckets.
	* Bolted to the ceiling above the cistern is a 15’x15’ rudishva aquafactor (tech).
		* It converts moisture in the air into water that drips into the cistern.
		* Although working and hence valuable, it is bulky and difficult to move.
			* Two rolls of 4d6 under DEX and INT are needed to unbolt and safely move the aquafactor.

* The two adventurers are sole survivors of a party ambushed by kaliyani at 5-126.
	* The survivors are a thief, the Silent Tempest, and a Khumus cleric, Kunda the Outlander.
	* Isolated and hungry, the pair distrust almost everything they encounter along the Midnight Road and defend themselves and their territory fiercely.
	* If surprised but not attacked by intruders, they will negotiate, hoping to use visitors as a ticket out of the Midnight Road.
	* They have explored a bit of the Midnight Road, and know enough to be afraid of the varuda guardian (5-107), curious about the armory (5-118), and suspicious of the debased varuda (5-119A). 

The Silent Tempest, 9th-level female Thorcin thief: SZ M; AL NE; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 9; HP 37 (max 50); #AT 1; Dmg 3-8 (short sword +2 of sharpness), or 3-6 (throwing dagger +2). 
Abilities: STR 11, INT 11, WIS 13, DEX 18, CON 15, CHA 15.
* Thief skills: PP 80%, OL 77%, F/RT 65%, MS 80%, HS 66%, HN 30%, CW 98%, RL 45%.
* Possessions: black leather armor +2; hooded cloak of elvenkind; two throwing daggers +2; short sword +2 of sharpness; potion of invisibility; a purse with 99 sp, 47 gp, and two peridots (500 gp each).
* The Tempest dresses all in black, including a black eye-mask.
* She is antisocial and unusual, avoiding eye contact and preferring to communicate either in hand signals or brief grunts; the lone exception is that she translates Kunda’s whisperings, albeit in her own cryptic fashion. She is venal and selfish.

Kunda the Outlander, 8th-level male Khumus cleric of Thanatos: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 41 (max 66); #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (club +3). Abilities: STR 11, INT 11, WIS 18, DEX 16, CON 16, CHA 8.
* Possessions: black leather armor +2; polished maple club incised with ebony (club +3); two potions of invisibility; a potion of extra healing; a potion of poison; a set of small copper scales with a bag of polished black stones; a purse with sixteen pieces of hematite (10 gp each), five jasper gems (50 gp), and two ivory statuettes, one of a mounted Khumus archer and the other of Thanatos (200 gp each).
* Spells: bless, create water, detect magic, protection from evil, remove fear; augury, find traps, hold person, resist fire, silence 15’ radius; create food and water, dispel magic, remove curse, speak with dead; cure serious wounds, knit bones (see new spells), neutralize poison.
* Kunda paints his face white with black accents in order to make himself look skeletal. He whispers constantly to himself in the tongues of the Khumus and of his god, Thanatos. Before taking any action, he breaks out his copper scales and pebbles, weighing them and sighing inscrutably.

GM Note
* The party descended through the chasm to the Nether Reaches (8-1).
* There, fending off the shadows, they discovered the concealed door at 8-19, and used it to access areas 8-24 and 7-34.
* They ascended to 5-125, but were treacherously ambushed by the kaliyani in area 5-126.

### 5-122: Broken Kaliyani Hall, north

* This portion of the former Grand Hall of the kaliyani is the largest to survive, 50’ x 25’, with a 30’ ceiling.
	* Collapses to north and south obscure the original dimensions of the chamber.
* The floor has been recently cleaned and swept.
	* The center of the room is a portion of a circular sunken area with light blue tiles. 
	* South of the sunken area was an enormous floor mosaic, stretching originally 70’ across the entrance to the hall.  Much of the mosaic is ruined by the collapse, but some scenes are still visible.
		* Depictions of rudishva, kaliyani, varuda, and varumani (concentrating on episodes of kaliyani epic history and legend, see below).
		* The kaliyani appear as slender, four-armed, sinuous beings in flowing robes, and may be seen.
	* Two slabs of the mosaic (from 5-123) are propped against the south wall.
		* The kaliyani explorers lurking in 5-125 recovered them.
	* Six candle stubs of red-wax are arranged in a hexagon to one side of the mosaic.
		* Among the candles is a piece of lizardman hide nailed to a board and attached to a metal spike; the spike has been driven into the stone floor.
			* The hide has been painted white; on it is a red ouroboros (one of the primary symbols for the kaliyani).

Mosaic images of Kaliyani doing stuff:
1. Exiting down a ramp from an enormous egg (GM Note: the egg is the Beacon)
2. Summoning a spirit in a group of eight
3. Displaying half-circular ‘rods’ which blast energy (kaliyani blasting rods, see tech)
4. Offering counsel to the rudishva
5. Directing large, lumpish beings (varumani)
6. Directing cringing bird-men (varuda)
7. Conducting research in scrolls and experimenting with chunks of orange rock (arcanum).

### 5-123: Broken Kaliyani Hall, south

* Three rudishva iris doors lead from the Midnight Road to isolated fragments of this formerly grand hall of the kaliyani.
	* They open when a orange, silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque is presented.
* Western and eastern doors: larger fragments once contained floor mosaics.
	* These mosaics were pried up by crowbars (recently judging by the dust around).
* The central door: leads to nothing but debris and collapsed rock.
	* Painted on the rock is a red ouroboros symbol (a common kaliyani symbol).

### 5-124: Statues and Stumps

* The iris doors lead to this ceremonial chamber, a blue circle inset into each.
	* They open when an orange, silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque is waived before the inset.
* The chamber is 20’ tall, clad on all sides in beautiful light-blue tiles (6” square) each with a yellow ouroboros painted in its center.
* Statues once stood in each of the niches.  Now three of the four niches are empty save for some fist-sized chunks of marble.
	* Even the nameplates on the pedestals have been vigorously effaced.
* The fourth still bears a name, “Lisstak”, and the stump of a statue: a headless, armless torso clad in a tunic.
	* A brass plaque on chain hangs around the headless statue's neck, reading (spidery Semi-glyphik) “Lisstak the Great, father of his people, prince of the people.”
		* Behind the statue is stashed a crudely fashioned replacement head (a primitive, ugly, thing of peeling, painted plaster; with a grotesque face, huge fangs, a floppy tongue, and exaggerated almond eyes) and crude wooden shingle carved (Varumani) “Lisstak betrayed us all! Never trust the kaliyani!”
	* GM Note: angry varumani created the replacement head and wooden shingle after the kaliyani betrayal, just before the varumani flight from Level 5 (see 5-141). When the kaliyani returned to this region several weeks ago, they removed the mocking desecration and added the current brass plaque.)

### 5-125: Ruined Corridor, with tunnel to 7-34

* This ruined section of corridor used to connect several of the kaliyani halls on the north side of the Midnight Road.  Some sections have suffered collapse.
	* A rough natural tunnel to the east leads down to 7-34.
	* An exploring party of kaliyani from Sub-Level 13 lurks here amid a circle of stones enchanted with continual light.
		* The kaliyani are ruthless and act to dispatch any intruders with maximum force. 
		* The kaliyani left SL9-37 for area 9-119, then followed a chain of tunnels (9-57 to 8-23, 8-24 to 7-34 to 5-125) upwards through the halls until they reached the present location.

* GM Notes
	* There is a chance Priddy of Archontos (5-128) may attempt to push his way past the kaliyani encampment (see 5-128 for the circumstances when this might occur, as well as for the chances that Priddy is slain (adding his possessions to the loot here in 5-125) or that 3 of the kaliyani are slain.
	* The troll thegn (7-30) pays handsomely both for kaliyani fangs and for hard information regarding their lair’s location.

### 5-126: Camp Site and Wall of Fire

* A permanent wall of fire separates this former administrative chamber from the Midnight Road.
	* A charred corpse of an elven adventurer lies in the Midnight Road in front of it.
	* Within 20’ of the wall on the south (1d3 fire / round), w/in 10' (1d6), passing through (2d6+12).
		* Scorched but still-usable chain mail +2 w/ owner's name on the gambeson (Hermonion, see 5-120).
* The chamber is clad in light-blue marble but is devoid of pictorial decoration.
	* Five corpses of human adventurers are scattered about a firepit.
		* The bodies are scorched and hacked apart.
			* Two normal suits of scale mail and some mundane weapons.
			* A scroll of clairvoyance stuck down the pants of one of the corpses.
		* A sixth corpse, a tunic-clad, serpent-headed being (kaliyani) lies among the adventurers; the elongated fingers of its right hand are blackened.
	* Seven bedrolls, 4 backpacks, a wooden chest, and a smashed water barrel.
		* The backpacks were opened and strewn about; a number of once-valuable items (potions, pieces of jewelry, gems, etc.) have been deliberately destroyed.
			* Among the debris (1 Turn searching) is a flask of black liquid.
				* A solvent for the poison on the coins: dumping the liquid on the coins produces a puff of acrid smoke as a chemical reaction burns off the poison; although foul, the smoke is harmless.
		* The chest’s lid is open, revealing 4,382 ancient silver pennies.
			* A pale yellow film coats the silver coins in the chest (+5% to detect traps), a powerful contact poison (save vs poison at -2 or die).

* GM Note: the human bodies are those of an adventuring party that made its way up from the depths through 5-125.
	* Despite believing they had an agreement with the kaliyani, whom they first encountered at 8-23, the kaliyani followed them and slaughtered them as they slept.
	* Only two members of the party escaped, their thief, the Silent Tempest, and their cleric, Kunda the Outlander (see 5-121).

### 5-127: Varumani Barracks

* The original rudishva iris door leading to this chamber is gone, replaced by an oval wooden door with sturdy iron hinges.
	* The door is kept locked and well oiled (key is held by Priddy of Archontos, 5-128).
* The darkened chamber is 30’ tall and plainly decorated in roughly worked granite.
	* The walls are lined with sleeping niches, each 10’ long and 3’ high.
	* Freestanding plasteel bunkbeds occupy every other square inch of the chamber, leaving only very narrow passageways (3’) between them.
* 20’ down the south corridor is a magic mouth, enchanted by Priddy.
	* Motion w/in 10’ causes it to shout, in a stentorian Archontean voice, “Alarm! Alarm! Intruders!”, alerting 4 ogre zombies at the entrance to 5-128.
		* The zombies move to repel intruders, and within 4 rounds, Priddy (5-128) arrives with reinforcements to investigate.

4 monster zombies (ogres): SZ L; AL N; AC 6, MV 90’; HD 6; HP 42, 40, 39, 35; #AT 1; Dmg 4-16. Special defenses: half damage from blunt weapons; immune to charm, cold, death magic, hold, and sleep; turned as ghasts. Special: always strike last in combat.

### 5-128: Priddy of Archontos

* Priddy of Archontos, a slightly crazed magic user and member of the collegium the Order of the Fifth Circle, has taken up residence in this former storage hall.
* The chamber is stripped of most of its original furnishings; an enormous and complex mural occupies the west wall.
	* Mural: three varumani wearing crossed belts with lots of loops, carrying unusual (and large) hammers, are pointing towards the north. The wall around them is dense with swirled geometric shapes mixed with small quasi-simian beings. A strange oval vessel in the background behind the three varumani (the Beacon). 
	* Plasteel shelving still lines the south and north walls
		* Priddy has filled the shelves with food supplies (dried meats, dried fruits, coarse cornmeal, a dozen bottles of young red wine, and two large carboys of cider).
	* Lit by four stones enchanted with continual light.
	* Hammocks hang in the northwest and southwest corners, and four bedrolls are arranged around a campfire in the middle of the table.
	* Two worktables and a small portable scroll rack.
		* Scroll rack
			* Scrolls: protection from magic, remove curse and suggestion, protection from elementals
			* Books (see below) and Spellbooks
		* Worktable (strongboxes): 
			* 4 fist-sized lumps of arcanum
			* 757 sp, 819 gp, a pouch with five tourmalines (100 gp each) 
		* A large collection of old keys, including a key to 5-129.
* Priddy’s apprentice, Mirko, and his four wary bodyguards accompany the mage. All are normally found in this chamber.
* When the alarm rings in 5-127, Priddy rushes with his apprentice and guardsmen to reinforce the zombies.
	* He negotiates first, but if met by force will respond, sending the zombies in first while he and Mirko cast spells and the warriors fire arrows.

Priddy of Archontos
* Priddy came to Arden Vul seeking arcanum.
	* Exploring the chasm six weeks ago, Priddy discovered 7-34, and used it to access the lower Midnight Road via 5-125.
	* Camp here, he became obsessed with the Troll Pits (5-131), believing wrongly that arcanum is connected to their operation.
	* He has brown and pink rudishva identity plaques.
* He is happy to trade information for arcanum, and can supply a good deal of knowledge about all areas and threats accessible from the Midnight Road (but not those accessible by teleportation).
	* Although slightly eccentric, he is not easily tricked.
	* He might trade some of his large selection of miscellaneous keys to those who procure at least 5 lb of arcanum for him.
	* He avoids the varuda guardian (5-107), and the defenders of the armory (5-118).
	* Although Priddy is content to remain here indefinitely, his bodyguards are growing anxious about the fact that they appear to be lingering in a highly dangerous area. 
* Priddy is unaware of the fact that the kaliyani have also recently discovered area 7-34 and have set up camp in 5-125.
	* If alerted to this fact, Priddy becomes quite anxious.  He does not wish open conflict with the kaliyani, whose capabilities are unknown to him, but he is also anxious to secure his route of retreat.  He departs from 5-128 for the outside within a week of learning of the kaliyani presence.
		* 33% chance the kaliyani detect him as he attempts to sneak past.  If so, d100: 
			* 25%: Priddy and all his men are killed by the kaliyani in area 5-125
				* His equipment will be found at 5-125.
			* 25%: Priddy is victorious and kills 3 of the kaliyani (remove from  5-125)
			* 50%: he escapes, minor injuries on each side

### 5-129: Varumani Practice Grounds

* Polished granite walls rise to a dome some 30’ above the floor of this brightly lit former ‘challenge chamber’ of the varumani.
	* On the north wall is a huge (10’x10’) stone carving of a grinning varumani face
		* Inspection reveals severe damage to the face, as if by magic and/or fire (from an annoyed Priddy).
	* Two plasteel rails, 10’ and 12’ long, are anchored to the floor at locations (A) and (B) by 3’-tall iron bars.
	* A ledge projects over the west door (C), and a trench 10’ long, 4’ wide and 6’ deep runs near the east door (D).
	* The floor at the center (20’x20’ square) covers a 20’-deep pit.
	* Dozens of metallic nozzles project from the walls (the key ones at locations E and F).

* Two rounds after the chamber is entered, the carved varumani face begins to speak in deep-throated Varumani (garbled due to damage).
	* “P..e…re Yo…elves! T t...t ..in… 5 … .. … …… .. … 1 …. Now!”
	* (‘Prepare yourselves! The test begins in 5…4…3…2…1… Now!’)
	* (see 5-133 for the non-damaged text of this speech, which reads ).
* If intruders retreat before the countdown is over, nothing happens.
* If any door remains open and/or a being is still present in the room at the end of the countdown, the doors slam shut and lock, the lighting starts to flash, and a training routine initiates.
	* Displaying a pink, silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque and saying (rudishva / varumani) "cancel training", "no training", etc terminates the training.
* There is a flat 20% chance that a given routine fails to initiate due to age. 
* Anyone on the ledge or in the trench will be protected from some of the effects.

Table One: Number of Effects (d4)

8
Gust of Wind: a powerful breeze is emitted from the varumani face, lasting 6 rounds. All must success-fully roll 4d6 under STR or be blown 1-4x10’in a random direction

### 5-130: Supply Chamber

* This former armory and supply chamber was stripped in antiquity. 
* All that remains are four 5’ x 5’ x 5’ empty stone containers.

### 5-131: The Troll Pits

* The Troll Pits were the site in which the varumani legions were bred and raised.
* The iris doors from the Midnight Road open to pink, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaques.
	* Each door leads past a small antechamber, with a variety of objects hangs from pegs.
		* Both sides: 2 gaffing sticks; lengths of hose in several gauges; 2 rudishva fire extinguishers (3 and 4 charges, tech)
		* East only: a fully-charged stun baton (tech)
		* West only: a bulky florescent green suit with a hood and plastic face plate (biohazard suit, see tech)
* The huge, 40’-tall chamber is clad in white marble and lit by numerous continual lights. 
	* Eight pits (20’ long, 10’ wide, 8’ deep) flush with the floor, radiate from a cross-shaped raised basin in the center of the room.
		* Four of the pits are covered with bioplas lids
		* Two are filled with foul soups of thick, viscous purplish fluids
		* Two more are empty and dry.
	* The cross-shaped central basin is 5’ tall, made of stone, and filled with gently burbling, pale-yellow, viscous, neuroderm (tech).
		* The surface of the neuroderm is covered by a softly-buzzing horizontal forcefield (to access, see 5-132).
		* The neuroderm matrix is itself living; kept warm by rudishva technology for thousands of years, and could still able ato create new life forms.
		* There is enough neuroderm present to fill two pits, with a bit left over.
		* If even a quart remains in the basin, it will regenerate (1 month creates enough to fill 1 pit).  If cleaned out entirely, the supply is lost.
		* Neuroderm is highly flammable!
		* At the bottom is a ring of spell turning (3 turns of careful (and disgusting) searching to find).
	* 4' tall ceramic basins occupy the eastern and western ends of the chamber.
		* These flush-basins have visible drains, projecting spray nozzle, and two plastic buttons (hot and cold water sprays).  Used to rinse off newly created varumani.
		* Only the western basin is operational.
	* In the northeast and northwest corners are two purple plasteel pads.
		* On each of which is painted a large ‘X’.
		* When 50+ lbs is placed on a purple pad, a series of ruby-red nubs along the walls by each pad emit interlocking lasers to form a force cage.
			* The lasers may be disabled from the control center in 5-132.
			* Pushing through the cage beams deals 8d8 damage.

Covered Troll Pits (A, C, D, and F)

* These four pits are covered with bioplas lids, which use obscure rudishva techno-sorcery to ‘cook’ the neuroderm into the form chosen at the control chamber (5-132).
* Three of the four covered pits contain fully ‘grown’ true varumani (of G, "Rudiga", model).
	* If these lids are removed (open doors), the varumani slowly emerge, groggy and uncertain.  Although fully mature, they will lack cultural and racial cues and, as a result, are 25% likely to go insane within 1-3 turns and attack all in sight.
	* If the varumani do not go insane, they will be susceptible to imprinting on any who take them under their wing.
* The fourth covered pit (D) contains a failed experiment by Priddy of Archontos (5-128).
	* If the lid is uncovered, an insane and deformed varumani-ibis hybrid springs forth and proceeds to cause mayhem. 

Empty Troll Pits (B and G)
* These pits are empty!

Goo-Filled Troll Pits (E and H)
* These pits are also the product of Priddy of Archontos’s (5-128) inept experimentation.
* Each pit stinks of rancid biological matter, bubbling and burping alarmingly.
* Each turn spent in the area, 1-in-6 chance that a purple pudding (new) crawls forth from the muck (up to 6 such puddings total).

3 G-model, true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or by weapon. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 
8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. As G-model true varumani, these creatures are not likely to prove loyal, exhibiting instead a penchant for selfishness, machination, and treachery.

1 insane varumani-ibis hybrid: SZ L; AL N; AC 6; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 41; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/2-8. Special defenses: regenerate 2 hp/round; immune to mind-affecting spells.

1-6 purple puddings (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 4; HP 28, 27, 25, 24, 23, 18; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: corrosive to metal and leather. Special defenses: immune to fire; grows with electricity; conductive.

### 5-132: Troll Pit Control

* An iris door leads to this small chamber (opens to pink, silver or yellow rudishva identity plaques).
* Within are the control panels used to operate  the troll pits (5-131).
	* The east and west walls are covered with live video screens showing all action in 5-131 (recorders are mounted above the draining basins in that chamber).
		* In front of each screen is a console with 4 smaller screens, 3 dials, and a slot.
			* Slot is for inserting a bioplas matrix.
			* The screens for pits A, B, C, and D are on the western wall.
			* Screens for E, F, G, and H are on the east wall.
	* In the center of the room is a 6' central pillar with consoles on opposite sides.
		* One displays a small screen and 3 dials and 6 buttons
			* it is used to control conditions (heat, viscosity, force shield) of the neuroderm basin in 5-131.
		* The other contains 33 buttons with slightly different octagonal shapes (varying number, length and thickness of interior and radiating lines)
			* A rudishva ‘keyboard’ used to program the neuroderm matrices.
			* Underneath is the small hatch of a biosample receptacle, which an open/close button, and a slot for a bioplas card to read/write.
		* A hidden compartment in the pillar (detect as a secret door)
			* 3 blank and 3 programmed matrices (one for each of the varumani models; see below).
	* There are two teleport nodes in small chambers off the south side of the chamber:
		* T2: access to 5-92
		* T9: access to 5-137

Operating a Troll Pit
	* Insert bioplas matrix card into slot of relevant station on the console
	* Twist the first button to ‘on’ (the screen lights up), camera view activates.
	* Turn the second dial to the appropriate setting of ‘heat’ (per the matrix card).
	* Turn the third dial slowly from left to right.
	* If this is done correctly, the screen will show a silhouette of the intended creation (normally a varumani) and a blue ‘completion bar’ which fills as the third dial is turned.
	* Once the bar is filled, the process takes 1 day plus 1-12 hours before the desired creatures is ‘fully grown’; progress towards this end is indicated by a ‘countdown’ clock on the screen (in Glyphik, of course).
	* Note: the consoles for Pits B and E are completely broken and inoperable.

Manipulating the Neuroderm
* One of the central consoles allows the neuroderm to be manipulated.
* One buttons turns on the console
* A second button is a simple ‘on/off ’ switch for the force shield that protects and contains the neuroderm.
* The three dials control heat, viscosity, and potency of the mixture.
	* For all but the most learned of technosorcerers, micro-adjustments to the neuroderm settings will be largely irrelevant and meaningless.
	* If the heat dial is turned to 3/4 full (180-degrees F; a stop marked with a line on the console), the neuroderm will begin to grow more quickly, allowing one to replace used neuroderm more swiftly (enough neuroderm to fill a troll pit will be grown in 1 week instead of a month).
	* If left unattended at this heat, the neuroderm will grow so rapidly that (absent the force shield), it will spill over the sides of the basin.
		* The entire chamber will soon be covered in a layer of neuroderm.  Should this occur, the neuroderm would have attained sentience, possibly allowing it to create its own creatures from the pits.

Imprinting a Matrix
* A bioplas matrix card contains the genetic instructions necessary to transform neuroderm into a living entity.
* The rudishva attained high levels of skill in biogenetic manipulation, although much was lost in the wreck of the Beacon.
* The varumani proved to be one of their most successful models, and the base genetic matrix for ‘varumani’ (G-model – see below) is still the default option that loads when the second tall console is activated.
	* The other two models of varumani are also programmed into the console; these models can be accessed easily from the main control screen. 
* Truly original and unique genetic creation (i.e., not merely modifying the default varumani model) is possible from the console; the only limitations to such Frankensteinian activity would be 1) the operator’s knowledge of Glyphik; 2) the supply of bioplas matrix cards; and 3) the supply of neuroderm.
* A GM willing to encourage radical bio-creation is responsible for the details of such activity.

Varumani, Model A (Vanara model): Heat setting is 95-degrees F. Pre-fabricated matrix cards are yellow.

Varumani, Model D (Druva model): Heat setting is 110-degrees F. Pre-fabricated matrix cards are green.

Varumani, Model G (Rudiga model): Heat setting is 100-degrees F. Pre-fabricated matrix cards are red.

### 5-133: Varumani Practice Grounds, redux

* Aside from the following exceptions, this chamber is identical to 5-129:
	* The varumani face is undamaged, and its speech is ungarbled.
	* 3 holographic varumani warriors appear as the ‘test’ begins - one at each door.
		* They engage any and all, shouting cheerful insults in Varumani all the while.
		* They aren't injured by the training routine effects, but can be ‘killed’ in combat.
		* If the room is entered a second or subsequent time, they will be back.
	* In the trench is the corpse of an ancient adventurer, still dressed in imperial field plate (av items) and gripping a halberd +2.

3 semi-solid holographic varumani warriors [effectively shades as created by the 6th-level illusionist spell of that name]: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 42, 41, 39; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. If the shades are recognized as unreal, use these stats: AC 6; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6.

### 5-134: Supply Chamber

* Like 5-130, this former armory and supply chamber has been mostly stripped.
	* Four 5’ x 5’ x 5’ stone containers remain, one of which has a few items still inside.
		* 3 Arden Vul cakes (av items); a dinged-up but still usable plasteel breast-plate (tech); a plastic container holding 36 small plastic figurines (toy soldiers).

### 5-135: Varumani Barracks 2

* The iris door from the Midnight Road opens to pink, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaques.
* Inside, the darkened chamber is 30’ tall and plainly decorated in roughly worked granite.
	* The walls are lined with sleeping niches, each about 10’ long and 3’ high.
	* Freestanding bunkbeds made out of plasteel occupy every other square inch of the chamber, leaving only very narrow passageways (3’) between them.
	* Secret Door (southeast): a 3’-tall, 4’-wide panel in the lowest bunk in the northwest corner. Hard to detect (1 in 8).  No opening mechanism, must be broken.
* A motion detector in the niche closest to the south exit triggers a holographic image of a varumani dressed in strangely colored rigid armor when anyone approaches within 10’.
	* The image speaks conspiratorially (Varumani): “Brothers! The treachery of the kaliyani has destroyed the perfect hegemony of the star borne. Our masters are killed or lie dying. The varuda are no more. But the varumani survive! The thegns, thinking as always about the welfare of their children, have located a new home for the pack! Druva and Rudiga remain to guide you, who are our rear guard. Vanara leads the people to a new life below. Seek Druva and Rudiga at the Command Chamber, and they will direct you to the hidden shrine. We await your swift return! Hurry!”

GM Backstory
* When the heqeti biological attack succeeded in wiping out most of the rudishva leadership and ensuring the death or quarantine of the varuda, the leaderless varumani decided to set out on their own.  This holographic note was left in one of the varumani barracks to assist any stragglers who did not join the initial exodus.
* The note reveals that the varumani thegns (Vanara, Druva and Rudiga) were aware of the kaliyani complicity in the demise of the rudishva hegemony. The varumani plan, as revealed in this note, was for Druva and Rudiga to remain at 5-137 (Command) to gather any stragglers; these would then follow Vanara and the main body down a secret route (5-141).
* Unfortunately the creators of the holographic note did not realize that Rudiga was complicit in the betrayal; he led kaliyani and heqeti warriors in a successful ambush of Druva (5-137). No stragglers ever found Vanara and the main body of varumani refugees.

### 5-136: Stripped Chamber

* This enormous chamber has been stripped to the walls, with only a few brackets, some broken mountings, and dozens of holes in the wall to suggest its former status.
	* A massive mural on the east wall shows three varumani dancing ecstatically, with hammers and daggers in their hands; around them flutter creatures (identifiable as chasm cephalopods and quasi-simians) .
* The skeleton of a huge varumani lies in the exact center of the chamber, surrounded by dozens of skeletons of heqeti (hoppers).
	* All the skeletons bear scorch marks.
	* When the chamber is entered, the varumani skeleton ponderously rises, points at any visitors, and demands in a booming voice (Varumani), “By the Thegn’s name shall the Way be made clear!”
		* At the proper name (“Vanara”), the skeletal varumani walks to the secret door in the east wall, inserts its finger into one of the holes in the wall, and waits while the secret door swings open.
		* If attacked, it merely shouts continually: “The Thegns will know of this treachery! The varumani shall find a new home! Beware!”
* Secret Door (northeast): hard to locate (1 in 8), -30% to pick.
	* The skeletal finger of a varumani opens the lock.

* GM Note: for info on Vanara and the fate of the varumani, see 5-135, 5-137, and 5-139.

1 varumani skeleton: SZ L; AL N; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 5; HP 25; #AT 0; Dmg nil. Special defenses: half damage from cutting weapons. This skeleton is a noncombatant, and will not defend itself.

### 5-137: Varumani Command

* The rudishva iris door leading to this chamber was destroyed in antiquity.
* The corridor is stuffed with a 3’-deep layer of rubbish and debris (+1x diff terrain).
	* Top layer: mostly of broken bits of rudishva equipment, mangled and burned bits of plasteel, leather, and wood, unidentifiable fragments of metal, etc; all abandoned when the varumani returned to fetch supplies and look for their missing thegns.
		* Within the debris is a discolored, but still usable rudishva plasteel breastplate (tech); 2 turns of searching reveal it.
	* Beneath: a layer of bones, 2/3 are heqeti (big femurs), 1/3 are varumani.
* This chamber was the nerve center of varumani operations during the rudishva period.
	* A triple-decker bunkbed and three troll chests (tech; keyed to Druva; even skeletal, his will work) occupy the northeast corner.
		* Chest #1: 10 25-lb bars of high-quality steel (25 sp each), 10 25-lb bars of pure silver (1,250 sp each), and 25 2-lb lumps of still-potent arcanum.
		* Chest #2: 5 rudishva lesser power supplies; 3 clips of 10 ordinary darts for dart throwers; 1 clip of narcotic gas darts; 1 clip of explosive darts; and a rudishva breather (tech).
		* Chest #3: a silk pouch sewn with a varumani face in gold thread (20 gp), containing 5 blue sapphires (1,000 gp each), 5 rich purple corundum gems (1,000 gp each), and a set of silver and ivory tokens for casting lots (a varumani game, 175 gp, but 7,500 gp to the current Thegn (7-30); 2 battle helmets, one varumani-sized, one for medium creatures (tech). 
	* The western wall features a large, cracked black mirror (viewscreen), and long, destroyed plasteel console.
	* On the south wall, a long mural that wraps on both sides of the teleportation niche. 
		* East side: varuda and varumani figures, with geometric and floral patterns
		* West side: a rudishva and a destroyed portion (used to hold a kaliyani).
		* T9: Access to 5-132 (Troll Pits Control)
	* Secret Door (southwest)
		* A closely held secret of the varumani leadership, known only to the three thegns and a few advisors.
		* Hard to detect (1 in 8), opens by brute force pushing in a section of stone.
* A titanic battle seems to have taken place here.
	* The entry to the chamber is littered with bones - mostly heqeti.
	* In the center of the chamber, lie five varumani skeletons.
		* One is particularly large, Druva the thegn, who died here with his housecarls defending the teleportation chamber.
		* Druva’s fierce spirit does not rest in peace, for he was betrayed by his colleague Rudiga.  Druva and his warriors rise as skeletal wights (new) to confront any new intruders, barking gutturally (Varumani) “Death to all traitors!”

GM Backstory
* Rudiga, the third of the varumani thegns, betrayed the varumani plan to escape the fall of the rudishva to the kaliyani, and hence to the heqeti. Rudiga secretly summoned a pod of heqeti to varumani command, where they swarmed Druva and his small rear-guard, killing them all.
* Vanara, who had led the main body of varumani to Level 7, returned with a small force to the Midnight Road seeking supplies and news of their lost brethren. He discovered the fate of Druva and Rudiga, but elected to keep this information secret from the rest of the varumani.  Instead, he lauded both Druva and Rudiga as lost heroes, whose miraculous reappearance the varumani saw as imminent.
* If evidence of the betrayal of Rudiga were brought to the current troll thegn and/or his court, therefore, it would cause seismic ruptures in the political makeup of the court, and would lead inevitably to a collapse of the careful détente that holds among the clans.

Druva the thegn, as an enhanced skeletal wight (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8+1; HP 55; #AT 1; Dmg 5-12. Special attacks: energy drain.

### 5-138: The Great Pillar

* The rudishva iris door leading from the Midnight Road to the Great Pillar requires a special key (not identity plaques) (-40% to pick, 12th level wizard lock).
	* 1’-long, 3”-diameter, grey plasteel rod with a notched, 1”-tall flange on each end.
	* The troll thegn (7-30) and the Arena Lord (6-85) each possess a key.
* The door leads to a 5’-wide ledge that circles a massive octagonal shaft.
	* The walls of the shaft are perfectly smooth black granite, treated by ancient kaliyani techno-sorcery.
		* Anti-magic makes the walls impervious, but magic works inside the shaft.
	* The air in the shaft is fresh, and a strong breeze blows from below.
	* A 30’-diameter pillar of black granite extends from the ceiling of the chamber (25’ up) down 1,100’ through 6-103 and 7-37 to the floor of the chasm (9-30).
		* Cut and smoothed by rudishva stone-cutting plasma torches.
	* A narrow stone bridge extends from the ledge on the east side of the shaft to the pillar itself.
	* Hand- and foot-holds are cut into the Pillar where this bridge reaches the pillar.
		* This precarious ‘ladder’ is invisible from the door, and descends the Pillar in a counter-clockwise spiral.
		* It is thus possible, although insane, to climb down the Pillar (5d6 under STR and/or DEX) to get all the way to the base.
* A pod of chasm cephalopods inhabits the upper reaches of the shaft
	* They are hungry and will be drawn to light and/or noise in 5-138 within 5 rounds. 

GM Backstory
* The rudishva built the Great Pillar in the heady early days of conquest before their technological resources began to grow scarce.
* Legions of hover-sled-mounted varumani and gliding varuda descended through the depths to combat the heqeti hordes.
* Although many of the varumani clans retain legends of these assaults and of the Pillar, only the thegn (7-30) and his court sorcerer (7-22) are aware of the true location and nature of the pillar, as well as the access it provides to the stronghold of their ancient foe.
* The thegn possesses two remaining hover-sleds (7-36, tech); a closely guarded secret.

10 small chasm cephalopods (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 2; HP 15, 14, 14, 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 11, 8; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-3/1-3/1-4; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

4 medium chasm cephalopods (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 4; HP 27, 26, 25, 24; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-4/1-4/1-6; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

1 large chasm cephalopod (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 6; HP 45; #AT 6 (five tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-8; MR 25%. Special 
attacks: surprise on 1-4; one tentacle drains spells from casters, adding 2-8 HP to chasm cephalopod per spell. 

### 5-139: Secret Varumani Shrine

* This bi-level cave is the site of a forgotten varumani shrine that holds the slumbering remains of the legendary First Thegn, Vanara.
	* The modern varumani still recount legends of the shrine, but are unaware of its location.  Those providing such information, let alone offering relics of great Vanara, would become instant players in the politics of the thegn’s court.
* The secret doors of the tunnel to 5-136 require brute force to push open.
* The natural cave's floor has been smoothed by varumani hands.
* Two enormous stone chairs sit at the edge of this cave, overlooking a cliff that drops 30’ to the floor of the shrine proper.
	* Sitting in the chairs are the skeletons of two of Vanara’s housecarls.
* The lower cave features a 40’ ceiling, is lit by seven wall-mounted continual light stones.
	* Three huge statues of varumani stand around a simple stone (granite) table.
		* The statues are inert, but remarkably well carved.
			* The names “Druva”, "Vanara" and “Rudiga” are carved in the pediments of the statues, from left to right.
			* The Rudiga statue has been defaced, and a huge Semi-glyphik and Old Thorcin symbols for “traitor” have been painted across its chest in blood. 
	* On the table lies a remarkably well-preserved varumani corpse (Vanara himself).
		* Mounds of smashed rudishva technology are piled to the sides of the table.
		* In front of the table is a locked troll chest and and 4 plasteel cylinders.
			* Troll chest (keyed to Vanara, skeletal hand will work): 10 gold bars (750 gp, 15 lb each); 10 platinum bars (2,500 gp, 10 lb each); earrings with loops attaching them to a torc, platinum and topaz (5,750 gp).
		* 4 plasteel cylinders (3’ tall, 1’ in diameter): unscrew to open, each holds 10 doses of potion.  #1: sweetwater; #2: extra healing; #3: invulnerability; #4: flying.

Vanara and His Actions
* Vanara and his housecarls wait quietly as giant rudishva (varumani) skeletons.
	* When intruders enter, the housecarls activate, leaping down the cliff if entry is from 5-140.   They shout (Varumani): “You approach the First Thegn. Bend the knee, and explain yourselves lest his wrath become apparent!”  Negotiation is possible (in Varumani only), though the housecarls are not very intelligent.
* If proper respect is shown (i.e., if the PCs respectfully approach Vanara and kneel in homage to the thegn), Vanara speaks.
	* He demands a full accounting of the history of the varumani since his exile.
	* If a plausible one is forthcoming, Vanara treats the PCs with neutrality or even goodwill.
	* Given disrespect, no account offered, or inability to speak Varumani, Vanara grows angry and prepares to attack.
	* Once angered, attempts to placate him bring his demand: “As a sign of your fidelity, you shall produce the Eyes, Heart, and Tongue of Rudiga within three days. If you fail, you would be advised to flee, for you shall be seen as children of Rudiga and, therefore, enemies of the People.”  If intruders don't withdraw in 5 rounds, they attack.
		* Unfortunately, Rudiga fled Arden Vul with his kaliyani allies millennia ago.
		* Returning without the viscera of Rudiga calls for a reaction roll (-45%) or be attacked.   If placated, Vanara will see them as lesser vassals, and command them to bring the modern varumani back to their ancestral homelands.

GM Note
* For a brief summary of Vanara’s career and the complex circumstances by which he ended up in this location, see the Testament of Vanara in the Arden Vul books appendix. 

Vanara, the First Thegn, as an intelligent giant varumani skeleton (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone

### 5-140: Pool with Depths

* This cave contains a 30’-deep pool of cold, clear water.
* A rocky tunnel leading north to 5-139 exits the pool 10’ below the surface. 

### 5-141: Transit Cave, w/ Access to 3-179 and 7-88

* Vanara found the hole leading to this cave when he was exploring in the Great Cavern.
	* The hole from 3-179 leads down 80’ to an intermediary (unmapped) cave, then down another 170’ to this natural cavern.
	* The northeastern wall of 5-141 has a chiseled image of a leering, salamander-creature (a heqeti); it is covered in exceptionally vulgar varumani graffiti.
	* The western tunnel (originally heqeti-made) leads to caves near the troll thegn’s court (7-88).
	* Secret Door (north): difficult to spot (1 in 8), opens only to an open doors check.
		* The northern tunnel was carved secretly by a select unit of varumani under Vanara’s leadership.
		* It connects this cave to areas 5-135 and 5-137, and served as the varumani escape route during the chaos of the rudishva collapse.
