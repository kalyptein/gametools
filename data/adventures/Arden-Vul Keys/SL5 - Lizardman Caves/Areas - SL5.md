## Overview

These caves are home to a lizardman tribe of unusual vitality and creativity. The tribe, which calls itself the Skreel or, sometimes, the Children of the Salamander, is led by a powerful lizard king/chieftain named Sgraal. A portion of their domain is flooded, and they have access to the exterior through a long set of tunnels and stairs to the south, leading eventually to the south end of Level 4.

They vaguely revere Kauket (see new monsters), thanks to the influence of their senior shaman, Kusok (SL5-31); most of the ordinary lizardmen, however, worship as their protector a terrible pukel-mander (SL5-28, see new magic items), who seems more real and terrible than Kusok’s distant salamander deity.

The lizardmen often fish and scout in the Drowned Canyon (Sub-Level 6), where they frequently engage in hit-and-run raids against the fishmen (see new monsters) of the Flooded Vaults (Sub-Level 7). They are also bitter enemies of the renegade Lagrok tribe of lizardmen found on Sub-Level 9.

The Skreel are unaware that their domain includes the lost abode of a powerful Archontean archmage, Kentillian the Magnificent (SL5-13A, SL5-14). Nor are they aware that Kentillian has transformed herself into a lich (SL5-13B), and still maintains possession of one of the pieces of the archonal regalia, the ebon spear (see new magic items). They merely avoid Kentillian’s island and warn any friendly visitors about the ‘bad spirits’ that infest it.

The eastern section of their domain includes some ancient heqeti ruins, in one of which Chief Sgraal holds court (SL5-36); the shaman Kusok has, unbeknownst to Sgraal, located another forgotten heqeti chamber (SL5-32).

The lizardmen are fairly canny warriors, trackers, and scouts on their home turf. They are expert trap makers and, thanks to their shamans, they have also learned to use molds and slimes as weapons against potential intruders. That said, the lizardmen are not necessarily hostile to all visitors, merely to those who arrive unannounced, who offer no gifts, and who appear bent on destruction. Others might be treated to negotiation and bargaining, for information or access, while those favored few who have done favors for the lizardmen might be rewarded with an audience before Chief Sgraal (SL5-36).

### SL5-1: Entry Cave and Traps

* A wide, relatively dry tunnel leads upwards 75’ over a gentle gradient to 4-165.
	* Entering Sub-Level 5, the humidity rises and the rough walls become decorated with signs marking this as territory of the Skreel tribe.
	* Signs include moldy and rotting heads of goblins, humans, and beastmen; old (and useless) stone spears and clubs; ‘medicine’ packets of dried flesh, dried mushrooms, and bits of coral; crude painted images of spear-wielding lizards, and simple runes.
* The tunnel opens into a broad, sandy cave, lined with ropy, seaweed-like strings of the green friend algae.
	* A lidded pit trap is concealed by a reed mat covered by a thin layer of sand.

	* The vigorous growth of the green friend conceals several niches (A, B, and C).
		* Lizardman guards occupy niches A and C.
		* Niche B hides a weapon and food cache: six stone spears, six stone clubs, some dried meat, some gourds filled with drinking water, and so forth.
* Friends or allies are greeted by lizardman warriors who step from the concealed niches.
	* Unknowns who approach cautiously and assert peaceful intentions may (50%) be warned of the pit.
	* Hostile-looking visitors receive no greeting; the warriors hope they fall into the pit.

	* He suffered a head injury long ago and has forgotten his past life and people.
	* The Skreel view him as a messenger sent by their god (the pukel-mander at SL5-28), and have treated him with respect and honor for the past twenty years, even as they find his lack of memory and general passivity puzzling.
	* Although still evil, his aggression has departed along with his memory, and he is content to chat with any but the most obviously hostile newcomers if they speak Heqeti or Lizardman.
	* Flisserak acts as a tactical advisor to Chief Sgraal (SL5-36), although his amnesia renders his advice only sporadically useful.
* His small cave has a raised bed of wood covered with green friend strands.
* He has carved a rough statuette of Kauket out of a 3’-tall chunk of arcanum (2000 gp).

### SL5-8: Water-Filled Cave

* Water completely fills this 30’-deep cave, except for a 5’-diameter hole that leads upward 20’ to SL5-7.
	* The water roils and churns with unseen currents and eddies due to the presence of a large water elemental bound here centuries ago.
		* The elemental is responsible for the strange properties of the water in these caves, and maintains the volume and freshness of the pools.
			* If slain, the sub-level’s waters would slowly turn stagnant, affecting the lizardmen and probably killing (or severely reducing the extent of) the green friend.
		* The lizardmen know of the elemental, and respect it as a ‘spirit’; they are intimidated by its frenzy and rarely travel here.
* A rust-free metal box rests in the exact center of the floor of this cave (marked ‘X’).

* Here amid the green friend (see new flora) dwell 11 lizardmen with their 4 hatchlings.
	* Searching for two turns produces one item from the table in SL5-2.

	* The green friend grows less vibrantly in this cave, explaining the clan’s relative poverty and low status.

##### SL5-13a: Burial Shrine of Kentillian the Magnificent

* On the cave floor of SL5-13, 40’ below the water line, sits a small white-marble building in the greco-roman style.
	* It is 10’x15’ and 12’ tall, with an arched roof.  The edge of the structure is lined by thin red porphyry columns (2’ in diameter).
	* The north pediment bears a full-relief sculpture, in black marble, of a spear (a hint to the location of the great artifact within).
	* The south pediment is inscribed (Mithric): Here lie the mortal remains of Kentillian the Magnificent, the life-bringer and death-dealer, the spear-wielder and the water-tamer. Know, O thieves, that her mind and powers still defend her and her treasures! 
	* Within is a beautiful sarcophagus carved of a solid piece of blue granite.
		* Its sides are incised with arcane symbols and runes.
		* The lid is carved in high relief, and shows a grinning elderly woman dressed in the robes of a sorcerer.  She holds an actual, impressive, black spear made of ebony and chased with silver sigils (50 gp).
			* This is Kentillian the Magnificent, an archmage of the late-Archontean golden age.
			* The ebony spear detects as magic, a false aura so would-be thieves believe it to be the ebon spear.  It can be pried up (stuck door).
			* The sarcophagus can also be slid aside with a combined 40 STR (max 3 characters at once), revealing a stone staircase (to SL5-13b) painted in complex geometric patterns on every surface – walls, ceiling, treads – concealing deadly symbols (see traps).
	* Initially the interior is dark and water filled, open to the surrounding waters.

 Entering the temple between the porphyry columns) triggers several magical effects: 
* Continual light bursts forth from the ceiling of the shrine;
* The water is expelled from the interior of the shrine, leaving it damp but air-filled.
* A hydrodaemon is summoned into the water surrounding the shrine.
* Any remaining piscodaemons from SL5-14 leap into the water to confront intruders (one arrives per round until all have entered the fray).
* The lich, Kentillian, awakens from her plane-traveling slumbers in the chamber below (SL5-13B) and immediately prepares actions to repel those who would disturb her rest. 

Symbol Traps
* The stairs under the sarcophagus are trapped with numerous castings of symbol, hidden among the complex geometric patterns.
* In order as one descends towards SL5-13b:
	* death (stair tread)
	* hopelessness (ceiling)
	* stunning (left wall)
	* sleep (right wall)
	* death (ceiling)
	* insanity (stair tread)

Kentillian the Magnificent
* Once alerted to intruders in the shrine, she takes vigorous steps to protect her lair.
	* Casts invisibility on herself, then uses her circlet to teleport to the now-dry shrine.
	* Casts time stop, then deadly offensive spells, including some combination of power words, repulsion (to push foes into the water to face the hydrodaemon), death spell, disintegrate, monster summoning, etc.
	* At the end of the time stop, she teleports back to SL5-13b (if initial attacks have not significantly affected her foes) or continues the assault (if winning).
	* If hard-pressed and followed into SL5-13b, she will eventually teleport to the Great Hall (3-123) to regroup.
* GM Notes
	* Kentillian can longer wield the ebon spear (despite her nickname “Spear-Wielder”), as the process of becoming a lich turned her evil, barring her from using the spear.
	* If awakened but not defeated, she takes up residence in the ruins on SL5-14 and extends her will over as many of the neighboring halls as is feasible.
		* She easily dominates the lizardmen, who will serve her and repair the structures on the island.
		* Within a year she will have extended her sphere of influence to include the Drowned Canyon (SL6) and portions of Level 4.
		* During this time she will transform this sub-level into a suitable lair for a lich, complete with a substantial number of undead and summoned servitors.
	* Kentillian’s phylactery is guarded by the water elemental at SL5-8. If Kentillian is reactivated, she will recover the phylactery and devise a new hiding place for it.

	* Ten thick-piled carpets (1100 gp each) line the hall; each bears a scene of Archontean history.

			* Kentillian rested here for 1300 years, until being awakened.
	* On an invisible ledge on one of the short walls rests the the Ebon Spear (new).
		* Kentillian ‘borrowed’ it from the archonal treasury intending to use its many powers on her own behalf, she was unable to use the spear (the spear is good-aligned, and Kentillian’s increasing fascination with necromancy and lichdom changed her alignment to evil).
	* A secret door on the wall opposite the staircase to SL5-13a once led up to the basement of SL5-14.
		* Opens only to knock (or destruction).
		* The staircase beyond is filled with rubble due to a major cave-in.

	* On the island stands the 3' stump of a column carved from black basalt.

		* The column detects strongly of evil, and bears spiral carvings of blasphemous imagery of sacrifice and destruction conducted by bloated amphibian beings.

	* The cave is littered with foot-traps placed at random beneath the water, everywhere except the path indicated by the dotted line on the map.
		* Foot-trap: save vs paralysis or immobilized for 1d3+1 rounds (no DEX bonuses to AC, -2 attack).
		* Careful movement off the path has a 50% chance per round to activate a trap; running or lunging through the water raises the chance to 66%.

### SL5-17: Guardpost Cave

* The tunnel from SL5-16 rises sharply, thus this cave is free from standing water.
	* To secure their primary route to Sub-Level 6, Chief Sgraal has placed a guard of 6 lizardmen here.

	* Inside are the ancient remains of Strith, assistant of Kentillian the Archmage (SL5-13a).  He grew alarmed by Kentillian’s as she neared her transformation into a lich, and attempted to flee.  Her daemonic agents tracked him down and slew him here.
	* Strith’s skeleton still wears rags of his old livery (a stylized “K”).
		* His rotted leather satchel: ivory plaque, a faded parchment
			* Plaque, inscribed in blood (Mithric) “1) Take the body of Kentillian the Magnificent to the resting chamber at the foot of the pillar. 2) Watch the water rise, and retire to the laboratory under the residence. 3) Wait for my summoned minions to transform you into a higher form. 4) Once transformed, wait four-score years before descending and releasing Kentillian the Undying. 5) Do not mention any of these details to those meddling priests of Thoth, and especially avoid Kel Bormol, the so-called ‘Overseer.’ -- Kentillian the Magnificent, soon-to-be Kentillian the Undying.” 
			* Parchment, partially burned (Mithric) “… you were right to contact me. Bring the incriminating plaque to the Great Hall at once so that we may stop this foolishness. We shall meet on the 24th. Keep quiet until then. -- Kel Bormol, Overseer.”

### SL5-21: Unsettling Sight

* At this intersection, a glowing mushroom patch on the east wall throws light onto two human corpses tied upside down to the green friend on the western wall.

### SL5-22: Lizardman Clan

* A group of 10 lizardman adults and 4 hatchlings occupy this cave, in which the green friend grows freely.
	* This clan has acquired a gold Sortian eye from the Drowned Canyon (Sub-Level 6), which they display proudly at the north end of the cavern.

* This 25' high cave can only be reached by swimming, both northern and western passages lie below the waterline (15' water depth).
	* Looming out of the water in the cave's center is a pukel-mander (new).

			* Touching it with anything other than a tear of Kauket (new) summons eight giant frogs to attack the intruders.

	* The senior shaman is Kusok One-Eye occupies the east cave (SL5-31); the two junior shamans are Lorg (in the south cave) and Bsak (in the north cave).
		* Lorg's cave: he has scraped away green friend from a section of wall and made some  interesting, if primitive, wall paintings showing lizards around a huge salamander.  He has taken a tear of Kauket from SL5-36 without Kusok’s permission, but doesn’t know what to do with it (hidden in a nook).
		* Bsak's cave: decorated with smelly, decomposing trophies (two fishmen heads, a giant snake, and, oddly, a mountain lion pelt). She plundered two black pearls (500 gp each) from SL5-36. Bsak is much smarter than the other two shamans, and less interested in serving Rimmaq-Isfet. She would like very much to return to ‘traditional’ ways. 
	* A fourth shaman, Kzaal the Prophet, has recently left to pursue a vision (see 4-2).
* 25% chance that any given shaman will be here; otherwise they are in SL5-36.

## Sub-Level 5: 31 - 47

### SL5-31: Kusok One-Eye’s Cave

* The cave of the senior shaman, Kusok One-Eye, is the most ‘civilized’ of the three.
	* A fine ebony stool, a weapons rack with a broadsword and mace, a tattered banner with an image of a black boar on it (an ancient Set war-banner), and a chipped set of crystal stemware which Kusok greatly admires (25 gp).
	* Hanging among the green friend are 6 gourds of double-doses of green friend juice (each heals 4-14 HP), 3 gourds keqemander acid (2d4  acid each, and 1 HP splash).
	* In a nook hidden by the green friend are 2 tears of Kauket; a bejeweled golden cup (1,250 gp) and 3 garnets (300 gp each).
	* At the rear of his cave the green friend conceals a narrow tunnel to SL5-32. 
		* If surprised in his cave, Kusok attempts to retreat to SL5-32.

* Kusok is an old and wily lizardman who has sharply influenced Chief Sgraal the past 20 years.
	* He located SL5-32 (but has not revealed to the chief) and gradually converted the tribe to a mild form of veneration of the demon prince, Kauket.
	* Unbeknownst to the rest of the tribe, Kusok has actually had a vision in which Kauket appeared to him and demanded fidelity; thus Kusok’s new faith.
* Should Kusok die, Bsak will make a serious play to abandon the dangerous ‘salamander-thing’ in favor of a more generic animistic worship.
	* Kusok is aware of Bsak’s tendencies, and would like to encompass her demise.

Kusok One-Eye, 7th-level lizardman shaman (25%): SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD as 5+1 HD monster; HP 35; #AT 1 or 3; Dmg 3-6 (dagger +2) and 1-6 (javelin), or 1-2/1-2/1-8.
* Possessions: dagger +2, of venom; javelins.
* Spells memorized: cause light wounds, light, resist fear; augury, chant, resist fire; blindness, cause disease; poison.

### SL5-32: Shrine of Heqeti Heroes

* This forgotten minor shrine to Kauket celebrates some of the great heqeti heroes of antiquity.
	* Vaguely hemispherical, the chamber's curved ceiling slopes down to the floor.
	* Twenty 5 lb spherical chunks of arcanum are embedded haphazardly in the walls and ceiling.
		* The arcanum chunks slowly drip a viscous orange ooze.
			* Originally the heqeti weavers would collect and cultivate it elsewhere, but it has been abandoned long enough for 3 slimes to form.
		* The chaotic warping of the arcanum has made this room a wild magic zone.
			* When a spell is cast, save vs spells.  Failing by 5 or more causes it to fail utterly, failing by 1-4 causes the spell to be warped (roll on table below).
			* A caster can roll 4d6 under INT to sense the strange currents.
		* The spheres could be removed with tools, taking 1d3 turns per sphere.
	* Two heqeti teleport wells occupy the center of the chamber.
		* Each well is a 7’-diameter circle of stone rising 3’ above the floor.
		* Inoperative, they are simply 10’-deep wells with a carven amphibian head with a 4”-diameter hole in the place of the mouth at the bottom.
		* Dropping a tear of Kauket into a mouth reactivates the well, filling the well with inky blackness.  Jumping in delivers on to 10-24.
	* Six 10' statues of heqeti heroes line the walls.
		* They fiercely brandish spears, javelins, clubs, and axes, all while displaying their gaping, tooth-lined maws.
		* The statue eyes are red gems (three missing, taken by Kusok One-Eye).
			* Of the remaining, three are tears of Kauket, six are garnets (300 gp each).

* To reward his devotion, Kauket has bequeathed protection from the orange oozes on Kusok One-Eye; as a result, they ignore him (but only him) when he enters the chamber.

D8 Wild Magic Effect

### SL5-33: Giant Crab Cage

* The shamans keep two enormous giant crabs penned into this side cave via a latticework gate woven of sticks, reeds, and green friend fronds.

	* Their appetites have stripped the cave bare of the green friend.
	* The north lobe of the cave rises above water, a resting spot for the crabs.
* 60% chance the crabs are penned in this cave.

### SL5-34: Lizardman Water Torture

* The water here is 15' deep, but the cave rises 10’ above the waterline.
	* Here the lizardmen hold and torture captives, binding them to the ubiquitous green friend.  They are positioned in various ways, half-in or half-out of the water.
	* The giant crabs (SL5-33) are allowed to inflict pain on the bound prisoners under close supervision of shaman Kusok One-Eye.
	* At the moment the tribe has five prisoners.

### SL5-35: Yurtil Skreel-Friend

* This dry side cave is the residence of Yurtil Skreel-Friend, a partly insane sorcerer whose mind was crippled by contact with Kauket.

* If visitors to the lizardman caves appear confident and powerful, Chief Sgraal will be willing to treat them as honored guests, at least until he can determine their motives.

GM’s choice

### SL5-39: Another Moldy Chamber

* Identical to SL5-38, except only a 10% chance a visitor will be found here. 

### SL5-40: A Third Moldy Chamber

* Nearly identical to SL5-38, except no visitor will be present.
	* A fragment of unusual mosaic exists under the grime that lines the floor.
		* It depicts great hopping bipedal amphibians spearing a variety of foes, including humans, spindly-limbed beings with horns, and varumani.  In the background an enormous ziggurat rises above the slaughter.
		* GM: not an actual event, but a form of heqeti propaganda; they suggest that due to their fidelity to Kauket (represented by the ziggurat) the heqeti are able to overcome all foes. The humans in the mosaic appear as crude ancient Archonteans, and the spindly beings are rudishva.

### SL5-41: Sgraal’s Hoard

* A narrow tunnel behind the throne leads to this heqeti-era chamber where Sgraal keeps the loot of the tribe.
	* A pile of mixed coins (12,395 cp; 8,587 sp; 3,875 gp); a matched set of three pieces of silver and emerald jewelry (1,250, 2,450, 5,000 gp each); a solid platinum statuette of a crouching panther (10,000 gp, 25 lb); three sets of rusting-but-usable chain mail (one is chain mail +1); and the legendary blade, Desmesure (an intelligent sword +2, dragon-slayer, new).
* Secret Door (south): opens by pushing inwards into the narrow corridor. The second secret door works in the same fashion.

### SL5-42: Secret Room

* None of the lizardmen knows of this chamber.
* On the east wall is a crude quasi-mosaic formed of largish pieces of stone fit into mortar.
	* Although the mortar is flaking, it still shows an amphibianoid placing something into the eye socket of a huge amphibian statue.
* The corpses of three ancient Archontean heavy legionaries and three heqeti lie here, all slain in close quarter combat.
	* One of the Archonteans was a dekarch.
		* His satchel holds a wax tablet of orders (100 gp as a relic of Marius Tricotor) (Mithric): "Eliminate the Hoppers near their subsidiary shrine in the caves past Kentillian’s Compound. Use the periapt to locate their foul nest, and put them all to the sword. Avoid their caustic slimes, and, above all, avoid touching their deities. We shall send in war mages to deactivate those idols after you have taken care of the defenders. -- Marius Tricotor, Archon."
		* His hand clutches a greater periapt of finding attuned to heqeti and demons.
			* It will indicate the presence of ‘something’ to the south (towards SL5-32).
	* The armor and weapons of the legionaries is unusable, corroded by the centuries.
	* The stone-tipped bone spears of the heqeti, still intact.

### SL5-43: Boundary Marker

* The door to this tomb-architect’s chamber is completely destroyed.
* A smear of color on the east wall marks the site of a destroyed Archontean fresco.
	* Unknown to the lizardman, the smear conceals a secret compartment in the wall.
		* It is locked (key long gone, -20% to pick) and plaster covers its keyhole. 
		* Inside is an ivory scroll case containing a parchment map all the non-secret areas of the tomb level of SL 6.
			* SL6-38 to SL6-46, SL6-58 to SL6-61, SL6-65 to SL6-67, SL6-70 to SL6-74, SL6-80 to SL6-87, SL6-90 to SL6-93, SL6-95, and SL6-97). Each of these tombs is labeled with its inhabitant. 
	* The remainder of the furnishings were looted centuries ago.
* A 5’x3’ hole in the south wall leads to the territory of the Skreel.
* To mark the northern boundary of their territory, the Skreel have impaled a fishman body on a stake and thrust it into a crack in the floor.
	* Yurtil Skreel-friend (SL5-35) scrawled (Archontean) “Skreel-Home” on the north wall.

### SL5-44: Sarcophagus Preparation

* The door to this chamber is hinged on the top of the door frame rather than the side.
	* Iron pins on the bottom could slide into matching floor holes to ‘lock it’ in place.
	* The pins have been removed, allowing the door is swing easily on its hinge. 
* Three unfinished stone sarcophagi stand in its center.
	* A set of chisels in a chamois carrying case (30 gp) are found inside one of them.
	* One sarcophagus is partly sculpted; one long side shows scenes of an archon dispensing justice.
* The walls retain a few fragments of frescoes showing scenes of Archontean burial rituals.
	* it is possible to pick out Thoth, Maat, Anubis, and other figures.
* A stunjelly has made its way from the Drowned Canyon (Sub-Level 6), and waits patiently along the north wall for fishmen, lizardmen or adventurers.
	* It has no treasure, making it even harder to spot.

1 stunjelly: SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 30’; HD 4; HP 25; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: paralysation; surprise 3 in 6.

### SL5-45: Storage Room with Lost Adventurer

* The door to this chamber has been spiked shut from the inside.
	* The sound of weeping is evident from within. 
* Leofwin Rufus, survivor from a failed expedition to the Drowned Canyon (SL6), has barricaded himself within the chamber, hoping to avoid the fishmen.
	* Childishly grateful to rescuers, he imprints on the most dominant figure, who thereafter receives the brunt of his increasingly awkward attentions.
	* GM Note: The corpses Leofwin’s party are at SL6-16a.
		* Leofwin got separated during a fishman attack and doesn't know their fate, or of the secret door at SL6-16a.
		* He knows the following route into Arden Vul: 3-1, 3-12, 5-2, 5-41, 5-43, 5-48, 5-35, 5-53, 5-55, 6-3, 6-5, 6-6A, 6-143, SL6-25, SL6-6, SL6-35, SL6-36.
* The walls are lined with fifteen large stone bins (4’x4’x4’).
	* Meant for supplies for the workmen delving the tombs of SL6, all but five are empty.
	* Bin #1: potable water, placed here by the Skreel for their warbands exploring SL6.
	* Bin #2: 120 chalk sticks in various lengths and thicknesses (mostly white, a few red and blue).
	* Bin #3: a 2’-deep layer of undecomposed fish scales.
		* Buried in the scales is a scale-covered mesh bag holding a garnet (300 gp).
	* Bin #4: a block and tackle, missing its rope.
	* Bin #5: 25 pieces of granite, each 12”x3” in size, roughly shaped into biped forms.
		* Meant to be sculpted into tomb garnishings, but never completed.
		* One of the pieces is much heavier than its fellows: actually a solid gold statuette of Bastet (4000 gp) with a permanent illusion cast upon it.
			* Offering it as a gift at the temple of Bastet (8-30) gives+40% reaction, or automatically improves the current relationship one step.

### SL5-46: Fishman Ambush

* The door is identical to that at SL5-44, and pinned into an open position by a long pole.
	* Two more unfinished sarcophagi are here; both are rough-hewen, without any sculptural decoration.

### SL5-47: Corridor to SL6-36

* This broad corridor leads 40’ north until it reaches the Drowned Canyon (SL6-36).
