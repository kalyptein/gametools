### The World

Magae
* The Archontean name for the world.

Wine-Dark Sea
* The ocean that binds together the continents and islands of northern Magae. These include Mithruin, Irthuin, Borealios, the Grain Islands, and Ostralios.

## Mithruin

* (MYTH-roo-een)
* A large island in the center of the Wine-Dark Sea. As the seat of the Archontean Empire, it is home to the great city of Archontos, the largest city on Magae. The remainder of the island is home to the estates of the Archontean nobility, the great imperial silver mines, and millennia of accumulated magical and mundane treasures. While Mithruin is obviously home to the Archontean people, it is also home to a sizable population of ‘imperial goblins’, now ‘civilized’ by centuries of enslavement, as well as a small colony of dwarves. Also known as Archontea (ar-KON-teh-ah).

#### Archontos

* (ar-KON-tos): The capital city of the Archontean em-
pire, and the largest city in Magae. Archontos is built on seven (and 
a half) hills surrounding a lagoon where the river pools before 
rushing into the Wine-Dark sea. The estates and towers of the rich 
cluster on the hills and along the mountainous slopes that ring the 
northern, western, and southern limits of the city. By hoary tradition, 
the elites in Archontos build towers for their lineages; these slender 
structures, with conical tops, provide the city with one of its most 
recognizable sights and one of its most familiar nicknames. Bridges 
connect the hills, allowing the well-heeled to pass from one hill to 
the next without descending to the flats; in addition to traditional 
bridges, sky trams exist in a few spots. The flat, humid areas between 
the hills are the home to the poor and middle class.
 Archontos is also known as: Mithruntir, the City, the City-
State, the City of a Thousand Towers, the Shining City, the Navel of 
the World, the Stirring Giant. Population: 125,000.

Constans XXV: The current Archontean emperor, who rules from 
his enormous palace in Archontos.

Prior Emperors

The Five Families



Lukon Carleon, aka Lukon the Soulless: Male Archontean. Like 
Keko, his title is merely chartoularios of the House of Sight, but 
in fact Lukon is the logothete of the Drome in Archontos, with 
supervisory powers over the leaders of the Drome elsewhere in the 
Empire. This makes him one of the most powerful figures in the 
Archontean Empire.





## Irthuin

(IHR-thoo-een)

A huge continent lying west of Mithruin 
across the Wine-Dark Sea. Its eastern coastline formed numerous 
provinces of the Archontean empire in antiquity, before the empire 
receded during the War of Sortians and Theosophs (q.v.). In 2639 
AEP, some 350 years ago, the empire returned, re-establishing 
exarchates in Narsileon and Arcturos, and subjecting the local 
Thorcin thanes to imperial authority. Eastern Irthuin is home to 
the Thorcinga. The middle of the continent is a vast swathe of 
old forest. The far west of the Irthuin is largely unknown to the 
Archonteans; there lie the endless steppes and the khanates of 
Khumus nomads. The largest elven realm, that of Lady Ellagel and 
Lord Gallador, also lies on Irthuin, amid the old-growth forests of 
the center of the continent. The legendary dwarven kingdom of 
Kazildor is said to rest beneath the mountains north and west of 
Narsileon. Irthuin is also known as Occidentos.


## Ostralios

(aw-STRAL-ee-os)

The continent lying to the south 
of Mithruin across the Wine-Dark Sea. The northern-most three 
hundred miles or so of Ostralios are thickly-forested tropical jungle, 
inhabited by monsters, refugees, and fierce local tribes. It is said the 
ruins of older empires lie buried in the jungles, as do, indeed, the 
ruins of the old Archontean city of Agoreon (q.v.). To the south, 
beyond the belt of mountains that rim this jungle, are said to lie 
exotic civilizations of great wealth and power; to the Archonteans, 
however, these stories are mostly legend.

#### Agoreon

(a-GOR-ee-on): A semi-legendary Archontean city, 
located in the steamy south of Ostralios. The city was destroyed in 
1775 AEP during the War of the Sortians and Theosophs (q.v.) and 
was never resettled. Only the tops of the hills on which the city was 
built now project from the warm waters of the southern oceans.


## The Grain Islands

* A chain of large islands to the east of Mithruin, perfectly suited for agriculture.

??? The majority of halflings living within the Archontean Empire reside here.

#### Ostentown
* The largest settlement on the Grain Islands. Grain and other produce harvested from the islands are typically shipped to other parts of the empire from this port.
* Population 3,750.

#### Wainscross
* An agricultural town on the Grain Islands.
* Population 2,500.


## Borealios

(bor-ee-AL-ee-os)

The Archontean name for the island 
chain to the north of the Wine-Dark Sea. Borealios is home to the 
Wiskinga. Although the Archonteans have claimed Borealios as 
theirs, and the emperor has assigned a strategos (general) to pacify 
the region, Archontean authority is limited to a few small towns 
(e.g. Westholm).

#### Freyr’s Landing

A small town located on Borealios. Jarl Boda 
Tingsson and his extended family rule the area, which is famous 
for its whaling, sealing, and ivory production. Population: 1,000.

#### Skallasholm

(SKAL-as-home): A tiny town on Borealios, founded 
by the legendary Wiskin jarl, Skalla Audunsson. It is known 
mostly as the location of the annual Althing, which most Wiskin 
landholders attend each autumn. Population 750.

#### Westholm

(WEST-home): The largest town on Borealios, known 
as the conduit between the Wiskin peoples and the Archontean 
Empire. Numerous merchants, both Wiskin and Archontean, 
occupy stalls here. The Archonteans maintain a sizable military 
presence here. Population 2,500.
