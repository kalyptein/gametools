Newmarket and Narsileon

Helena the Unseen: Female Archontean magic user. Helena is 
mistress of the college of Perception in Narsileon and would very 
much like to bring Tikun Thane to heel for past transgressions 
against the college.



Narsileon (nar-SILL-ee-on)
Important city on Irthuin, and the seat of an Archontean exarchate. After the retreat of the empire from Irthuin, Narsileon had been solely populated by Thorcinga for almost a thousand years. When the Archonteans returned to the western continent in 2639 AEP, they subjugated Narsileon and expelled many of its leading Thorcinga citizens so as to 
accommodate an Archontean ruling class of lords, merchants, and soldiers. Order is kept by the several legions quartered in its cantonments.
Population: 40,000.

Storm Point: A fancy villa located on the cliffs south of Narsileon. The estate was formerly owned by the exarch of Narsileon, but has recently been purchased by Alexios Hestales.


Valerian Krakteros: Male Archontean aristocrat and current ex-
arch of Narsileon. Valerian is a hard-nosed politician who cares 
mostly about his own power and about pleasing the Emperor. 

Ysabet Basileon: Female Archontean aristocrat and courtier. 
Ysabet is cousin to Alexia and Iskander Basileon. An accomplished 
intriguer, Ysabet has managed to arrange to be married to the 
exarch of Narsileon, Valerian Krakteros. She hopes to manipulate 
him to further her own career.

Alexios Hestales: A parvenu Archontean nobleman, and recent 
purchaser of the former imperial estate called Storm Point. Alexios 
is rich and arrogant, but not particularly smart.

Chloris Hestales: Born into the Xenarcheon clan, she is wife of 
Alexios Hestales, whom she manipulates ruthlessly.

Keko the Lame: Male Archontean, and logothete (or chief admin-
istrator) of the Drome in the exarchate of Narsileon. Keko is thus 
responsible for all imperial intelligence and special operations in 
the exarchate. He appears as a courtly man in his early sixties, with 
silver hair and piercing black eyes; his left leg is largely useless, 
and he walks with a cane. Keko’s name is used to inspire fear in 
children, while the fact that his family name is unknown causes 
equal consternation among the Five Families.

Plashey the Face: Male Archontean. The public ‘face’ of the Ven-
geance Factor in Narsileon.
