## Overview


A tiny Thorcin village called Gosterwick was in this area.  Alexia rolled in and built the town of Vetucaster, which has essentially absorbed the village, but often gets called by its name.


The Azure Knights are important to Alexia's scheme of Gosterwick.  They are empowered to create forts to guard the borders of the empire, so technically, they have established Azure Keep, and a town has sprung up around it, but of course it's fueled by Alexia's cash, and she's appointing officials.  Iskander could try to seize authority, but he'd be depriving the Knights of their lawful holding, plus of course there's influence games going on behind the scenes.  He's hoping she just fails, burns a bunch of cash and doesn't get anything of note out of the ruins and then he can patronizingly claim the town from her, but that doesn't seem to be happening.


The closest safe haven for adventurers exploring the Halls of Arden Vul is the small town of Gosterwick, which has rapidly grown up at the foot of an ancient fortress, the Azure Keep.

Lying only a few miles west of the Long Falls (EX-3), 

Gosterwick and the Azure Keep occupy an advantageous site atop and around a semi-circular, granite ridge.

Until recently, the Keep was a ruin, and the site of Gosterwick was inhabited only by a handful of husbandmen and their families.

Twenty-five years ago, however, the mysterious Green Lady arrived at the Azure Keep with her companions, a sept of the Knights of the Azure Shield. 

Lady Alexia and the knights claimed the tower as their own and began to restore it, swiftly making it their base of operations in Burdock’s Valley.

Now known as the Azure Keep, it takes its name partly from the name of the knights’ order, and partly from the azure-blue tiles that define the Keep’s roof.

In addition to the keep proper, the Knights sponsored the restoration of other buildings in two baileys located atop the ridgeline, including a grand fortified residence for Lady Alexia, stables, dwellings for craftsmen, a well, and stout walls.

Only a few years later came the news that Lady Alexia was building a new town at the foot of the keep; this town, formally named Vetucaster in Archontean, but known to most by its Thorcin name of Gosterwick, also profited from an ambitious, and swift, building program.

Currently some 2,200 souls dwell in Gosterwick, including representatives of several of the Factors, a local chapter of the Benevolent Brotherhood, and numerous traders and craftspeople.

Lady Alexia is actively recruiting merchants, factors, workers, and retired adventurers to her thriving community.


Gosterwick: A truly new town, growing at the base of the cliff 
outside Arden Vul, around the Azure Keep (q.v.). Lady Alexia 
Basileon (q.v.) is actively recruiting merchants, craftsmen, and 
adventurers to this location. The current population bears a high 
proportion of adventurer-oriented businesses: sellers and buyers of 
curios, general sutlers, trainers, etc.  Population: 2,200.


The Knights of the Azure Shield
 A military order that spans the empire, the Knights of the Azure 
Shield are organized into septs of twenty knights (plus squires) led 
by a Sept Commander. The entire order is governed by the Grand 
Master from the Night Tower in Archontos, although individual 
septs traditionally operate as distinct, largely-independent units. 
Founded 400 years ago by the great paladin of Mitra, Keladon 
Gesedion (known as ‘the Wall’), the mission of the order is to aid 
the needy wherever they may be found, without regard to faith, 
alignment, or social rank. As a result, the order has a reputation as 
a motor of social mobility, as the stories of men and women from 
modest backgrounds who joined as grooms, lackeys, or servants 
and rose to become a squire and/or knight are legion. While not 
technically defined by alignment as a ‘good’ organization, the 
order has nevertheless acquired a reputation as a haven for naive 
do-gooders.
 The sept that has restored the Azure Keep is unusual among 
the order, and for several reasons. First, it is obviously aligned 
to a political figure, Lady Alexia Basileon. This runs contrary to 
the usual ethos of the knights, who pride themselves for their 
neutrality in the game of the Five Families. Many thus sneeringly 
dismiss this sept as ‘mere mercenaries’ working for the Green Lady. 
Secondly, it is larger than a normal sept, with thirty knights and an 
equal number of squires. Finally, its goals and motives appear to 
most observers to be opaque, and certainly not typical of the order. 
While the knights living in Burdock’s Valley have been known to 
assist travelers on rare occasions, they do not seem to seek out the 
needy and downtrodden; instead, they seem more inclined to keep 
to themselves. Some wags claim that the knights literally have been 
bewitched by the ‘Green Witch’ (Alexia).
 Rather than detail the entire Keep and town, what follows 
aims to provide GMs with a rough framework of information to 
aid those PCs seeking a place to heal, rest, trade, and train.

Population
Gosterwick has 2,211 inhabitants, of whom 40% are Archontean, 40% are Thorcin, 15% are Wiskin, and 5% are demi-human (primarily halflings and imperial goblins, although there are a few elves and dwarves). 

Rulers
Gosterwick is governed by a thesmothete appointed by 
Lady Alexia. Currently, the thesmothete is Eusebia Phokas (AK-
23). As Eusebia’s jurisdiction extends only over the town proper, 
the Azure Keep is governed separately, by Sept Commander 
Horatius Gesellion (AK-1). Of course, true authority over both 
town and keep lies with Lady Alexia Basileon, who dwells in the 
Residence lying on the ridge just north of the Keep (AK-2).
Government

The Thesmothete: Eusebia Phokas holds the executive power 
in Gosterwick, as she supervises the other imperial agencies from 
her town house (AK-23). She is aided in her bureaucratic work by 
three proedroi, and seven chartoularii. Eusebia is a capable and 
experienced administrator, and only kicks decisions up to Lady 
Alexia when they concern unusual problems.

Imperial Bureaucracy: As an imperial town, albeit one started 
quasi-illegally by a renegade aristocrat, Gosterwick possesses the 
three familiar agencies of all imperial communities, namely the 
House of Sight, the House of Coins, and the Private House. In a 
brazen break with authority, Lady Alexia has simply appointed 
her own candidates to run the three bureaucratic offices, granting 
each of them the title of logothete regardless of their previous 
postings or experience. The House of Coins (AK-19), responsible 
for general taxation and public expenditures, is the largest of the 
three in Gosterwick; Lady Alexia has conferred its administration 
to an old friend, Theron Glesteon. The Private House (AK-15), 
which traditionally administers the estates and possessions of the 
imperial family in a given jurisdiction, is significantly smaller than 
usual in Gosterwick, since as of yet the emperor has claimed no 
territory here for his own. Its logothete is Aedelwine the Fair. The 
House of Sight (AK-13), responsible for postal service, diplomacy, 
and imperial intelligence-gathering, is also small in Gosterwick; 
indeed, its logothete, Audun Yellow-Eyes, has not yet been 
recognized in his office by his alleged superiors in Narsileon.



Justice
 The four normal categories of Archontean justice are operative 
in Gosterwick.


* High Justice
	* Crimes against the Emperor and/or against the State.
	* Typically, this means treason, murder, arson, rape, criminal conspiracy, and any type of crime committed against a member of the imperial family or against imperial property. 
	* Punishment: fines followed by death, by inventive, public, and slow means.
	* Judge: Lady Alexia Basileon
	* Procedure: accusations are initiated by Lady Alexia or her agents; hearings are held on an ad-hoc basis

* Justice of the Body
	* Offenses against the persons of imperial citizens, or of those granted judicial protection by the Empire. 
	* Typically, this means assault, insult, slander, wounding, sexual assault (other than rape). 
	* Punishment: varies, ranging from fines, to amputation, to death.
	* Judge: Eusebia Phokas, the thesmothete. 
	* Procedure: citizens file a complaint (for a fee) with the thesmothete’s office. Eusebia holds sessions once per quarter to settle these cases. 

* Justice of the Domus
	* Crimes against the property of imperial citizens.
	* Typically, this means burglary; theft; damage of 50 gp or more to movables or immovables; disputes over marriage, divorce, or inheritance; disputes over ownership of property worth 50 gp or more.
	* Punishment: fines, or amputation, or blinding, or castration, or a combination.
	* Judge: one of the three proedroi serving the thesmothete.
	* Procedure: citizens file a formal complaint with the thesmothete’s office. The complainant pays for a writ of summons, executed by thesmothete’s office in order to enforce attendance at court. Both parties are expected to produce their own witnesses, evidence, and/or advocates for their cases. Each proedros holds court once per quarter.

* Low Justice
	* Crimes against non-citizens, and petty crimes.
	* Typically, this means all crimes involving non-citizens; disputes over damages to, or ownership of, goods worth less than 50 gp. 
	* Punishments: varies widely, ranging from fines to death.
	* Judge: one of the seven chartoularii.
	* Procedure: The chartoularii hear such cases on a bi-monthly basis in a public square. Complainants register before dawn for a hearing time. Cases are heard orally, and the chartoularios makes a summary judgment




Town Guards
* A contingent of 40 guardsmen enforce the peace and the orders of Eusebia Phocas. They reside in two fortified wooden towers, known colloquially as the ‘kettles’ (AK-32).

The Wardens of Vetucaster
 Lady Alexia (AK-2) has initiated a new program designed to 
attract well-to-do merchants and adventurers to Gosterwick. She 
calls it the ‘wardens’ program, for anyone who takes up the offer is 
given an impressive diploma naming him- or herself as a ‘Warden 
of Vetucaster’. Wardens are granted the rights of citizenship and 
the opportunity to buy land within the town at a 50% discount; 
in addition, for every prosperous merchant or craftsman that a 
Warden convinces to settle in Gosterwick, she pays a 750 gp bounty 
(similarly with aristocrats) to the Warden. In return, the Warden 
must commit to remaining in residence at Gosterwick for at least 
80 days per year (20 days per season), must contribute to the town 
defense, and must obey the lawful orders of the thesmothete or the 
knight commander. Alexia is explicitly targeting mid- and high-
level adventurers (such as Wicktrimmer - see AK-17) who might 
be interested in retirement, but who are still active and useful. 



Training for Level Advancement
Training costs: 1,650 gp per week.

Fighters: Fighters may train with the knights of the Azure Shield, under the supervision of their arms master, Martin Hadellor (7th-level fighter). See AK-1.

The chief huntswoman of the Lady Alexia, Teodora Balcingor (7th-level ranger)

Paladins: The primary guardian of the temple of Mitra (AK-7) is one Gesteon Probus (6th-level paladin). He will train paladins but will attempt to convert them to Mitra in the process.

Magic Users: The ability of magic users to train is more complicated, as the expectation within the Archontean Empire is that magic users will train in the facilities of the collegium to which they belong. As none of the collegia has established an outpost in Gosterwick yet, this poses a problem. Happily, an enterprising and venal young wizard has attempted to solve this problem. Recognizing that she could not open a ‘school’ of magic, since this would compete with the collegia, Lyssandra Astorion (7th-level magic user) has instead opened an ‘Arcane Practitioners Club’ on the outskirts of Gosterwick (AK-30). Members pay heavy weekly rates (equivalent to training rates) for the opportunity to come and use the club’s small library, alchemical laboratory, and practice grounds. Of course, members are free to seek guidance from other members, and Lyssandra and her assistant, Pelteon Greywand (6th-level illusionist) spend most of their time providing such ‘guidance’.

Clerics: Several of the temples are staffed by priests experienced enough (and willing) to train clerics. Good clerics could seek out Jador the Just (9th-level female Wiskin cleric), chief priestess of the temple of Mitra (AK-7), or Vivian (9th-level male Thorcin cleric), chief priest of the temple of Demma (AK-9). Neutral clerics should probably look for Halidor the Observant (7th-level male Thorcin cleric), chief priest of the temple of Lucreon (AK-10). Those aligned with evil are best advised to seek training from Urdenna Belst (8th-level female Archontean cleric), chief priest of the temple of Heschius Ban (AK-8).
 
Druids: Even though

The nearest Druid’s Circle (some distance away, 50 miles to the east, in the Old Forest) has dispatched a representative to watch affairs in Gosterwick. Fael Valdorsdot is the representative (6th-level female half-elf druid).  Fael spends a lot of time wandering in the woods and streams around Gosterwick, but she can be reached through a contact at the Grain Hall (AK-18). It may take 2-6 days for her to be available.
* Other elves from their home community have been sent to look for Gerrilad and the others who became the Niravairi.

Thieves: 

Can the local chapter of the Benevolent Brotherhood by making the appropriate signs and uttering the appropriate code phrases in the public spaces of Gosterwick.  The Brotherhood will then contact the thief.

Thief PCs of levels 1-3 will be trained by Reesa the Hammer, who works as a bartender at the Muddy Puddle (AK-26).

Those of levels 4-5 will be trained by Anders the Snake (AK-5).

For thieves of levels 6-9, however, a meeting must first be arranged with Anders or Reesa; if either of these two can be convinced of the good intentions (sic) and bona fides of the PCs, he/she will arrange a meeting with Wicktrimmer, the Elder Brother of Gosterwick (10th-level imperial goblin thief). Wicktrimmer meets such PCs incognito in the cemetery for an initial interview; training will then take place in a warehouse near the docks. Wicktrimmer usually only trains those who tithe appropriately and perform a special ‘job’ for him.
 
No chapter of the Vengeance Factor in Gosterwick yet

A freelance assassin, Revet Faidelsson (7th-level male half elf assassin) has taken up quiet residence at the Yellow Cloak (AK-21).  Anders the Snake (AK-5) and Wicktrimmer (AK-17) know of Revet’s line of work

## Features

##### The Walls to Come

* Only the hill and ridge holding the Azure Keep, the Residence, and the Upper Market have been fortified.   The bulk of the town currently lacks walls.
* Lady Alexia’s ambitions are quite grand, and she hopes to enclose the town with impressive walls that will allow plenty of population growth.
* A small ditch and 3'-tall earthen mound indicate the course of the walls to come.
	* It is obvious to all that it will take years and much treasure to build the projected walls. 

##### The Three City Gates

* Alexia envisions three mighty gates to her fully-developed town.  All three have been built, even though only one currently serves any function.
	* To the east, by the lake, is the Water Gate. A gatehouse anchored by two 15’-diameter stone towers blocks the narrow strand between the ridge and the lake. This is the only gate that is currently incorporated into the actual structure of the town.
	* The Imperial Gate, which naturally lies at the foot of Imperial Row, stands proudly amid empty meadows. The towers of its gatehouse are 20’ in diameter; as of yet it lacks a door. 
	* The Stone Gate lies to the west, at the foot of Stone Street. This is the least developed of the gates; as yet it is only a wooden structure, without grandeur or defensive value. 

##### The Waters

* Gosterwick abut a tributary of the Swift River, which locals call The Long Run.
* The Long Run flows through the foothills west of Arden Vul before forming a small lake just north of the town, called Totey Lake by the local Thorcinga for centuries.
	* Few recall that its original name was Thoth’s Eye, and none recall that the priests of Thoth had an interest in the lake (potential for future adventure development).
	* The lake is fairly shallow, except in its center; it is home to numerous species of edible fish.

##### Neighborhoods

* Azure Keep & Residence
* Upper Market
	* Occupies the southern baily of Azure Keep.
	* Expensive shops and snobby citizens.
* Under-Keep
	* Eastern edge of town, between the two lobes of the ridge on which the Keep sits.
	* Main street is Keep Row.
	* Poor and seedy, mostly wooden houses and structures.
* Market District
	* Arranged around the Central Market (AK-22).
	* Larger buildings, general prosperity.
* Incense District
	* Northernmost area.  Named for the scent wafting down from Temple Hill.
	* Split identity.  Along the Golden Road, wealthy and prosperous, with freestanding homes of the wealthier burgesses.  To the east, by Totey Lake and Water Gate, are poorer inhabitants, brick tenements.
* The Hill of the Gods / Temple Hill
	* Held the old temples of the Twelve, now houses the Church of the Immortal Flame and a temple to the Thorcin gods.
* The Outs
	* Used contemptuously to describe the multitude of cheap, quickly-built structures on the west side of town.

### Government

##### Azure Keep
* AK-1
* The Knights of the Azure Shield are renovating this partly-ruined citadel built by the ancient Archonteans.
* The keep is sited atop a curved ridge that rises 45’ above the flatlands surrounding it.
* The central tower of the keep is 50’ square, with four above-ground floors (plus the roof level) and two below-ground cellars.
	* There is no ground-floor access.  Wooden stairs rise to doors at the first floor.
	* Numerous arrow slits, or windows, dot the walls of the first, second and third floors; each window can be shuttered from within the keep.
	* The cylindrical roof reaches nearly 65’ above the ridge, clad in sky-blue porcelain tiles.  The roof level has four larger openings in its walls that allow ballistae to fire at attackers from all directions.
* The keep also comprises walled baileys to the north and south of the tower.
	* The northern bailey contains the stables of the Order, a stone barracks for the knights and their guests, and the Residence (AK-2), home to Lady Alexia.
	* The southern bailey contains the Upper Market neighborhood of wealthier shops and homes.

People
* Horatius Gesellion (9th-level male Archontean fighter): Sept Commander of the Knights of the Azure Shield.
* Gaius Christopher Relleion (6th-level male Archontean fighter): leader of First Conroi
* Martin Hadellor (7th-level male Archontean fighter): arms master for the Knights, leader of the Second Conroi
* Lucia Nemead (6th-level female Archontean fighter): leader of the Third Conroi
* 27 knights: divided into 3 conrois (troops), of nine knights, each led by a Knight Commanders.
* 31 squires: each hand-picked by a single knight.
* 65 grooms, lackeys, servants, cooks, and other support staff. 

Services
* The knights have their own stable, smith, farrier, leather-worker, and bowyer and fletcher. Only knights or their very close friends can make use of these services. 

##### The Residence

* AK-2

* The northern, fortified bailey of the Keep complex is home to a large stone palace, where Lady Alexia resides.
* The Residence is a basic, three-story rectangle.
	* The ground floor holds ‘public’ spaces, including a grand audience hall, a library, a formal dining room, and the kitchens.
	* The second floor holds Alexia’s personal apartments, her study, and her treasury.
	* The third floor is devoted to rooms for servants and guests.

People

* Lady Alexia Basileon, the ‘Green Lady’ (7th-level female Archontean mage and aristocrat)
	* Alexia has piercing green eyes, and favors emerald-green clothing.  She is somewhat paler than the Archontean norm.
		* It is little know that her mother was a Thorcin princess, and she is secretly on excellent terms with many local thegns.
	* Around age 30, began Gosterwick at 20.
		* She and Iskander are the "young turks" fronting power blocs within the Basileon family, as their matriarch declines.
	* Somewhat reclusive, preferring to remain in the Residence most of the time.
	* It is not widely known that she is a talented mage, with an interest in water magic. 
	* Engaged in a struggle for influence in Burdock’s Valley with her half-brother, Iskander. Iskander managed to convince the Emperor to award lordship over the valley to him, over her strenuous objections.  She has retaliated indirectly, by founding Gosterwick and attempting to win the allegiance of the local farming and merchant families.
		* The sept of Azure Knights allied with her (hoping to forge close ties with the hoped-for rising faction of the Basileon family) provides legal cover for Gosterwick.  They can found outposts to guard the frontier, as she has enlarged it with her backing.
	* Recognizing that their dispute will shortly come to a head, Alexia is also hiring capable adventurers to search Arden Vul for the four lost pieces of archonal regalia; she believes that if she could obtain these minor artifacts, her claims will be given greater credence.
		* The regalia are the bone ring of Jagri-Naz (area 5-74), the tablet of the beacon (9-107), the ebon spear (SL5-13B), and the iron circlet of Ghanor (3-127A).
* Freydis the Stern (female Wiskin aristocrat): no-nonsense steward of the Residence.
	* Visitors will mostly meet with Freydis, rather than Alexia, unless they are particularly trusted, high-ranking, or useful.
* Theodora Balcingor (7th-level female Thorcin ranger): chief hunter and primary advisor to Lady Alexia
* 10 guards
* 15 staff

Services
* Alexia can arrange for healing services and the provision of equipment for those whom she has taken into service.
* She can arrange for up to ten potions of healing at a slight discount (350 gp/potion).

##### The House of Sight

* AK-13
* This branch of the Archontean bureaucracy is responsible for the imperial postal service, diplomacy, and, unofficially, intelligence gathering (the Drome).
* A comfortable, 2-story wood structure.
	* First floor: reception and audience chamber, several private interview rooms, and a small guardroom.
	* Cellar: cells for prisoners, and a lead-lined vault for storing treasure and valuable information.
	* 2nd floor: logothete’s quarters, a map room, and a scrying room.

People
* Audun Yellow-Eyes (male Wiskin aristocrat): logothete of the House of Sight
	* Of Wiskin birth, but ‘more Archontean than the Archonteans’ in his loyalties.
	* Appointed by Lady Alexia and not yet recognized in his office by his alleged superiors in Narsileon (either the mundane House of Sight or Keko the Lame in the Drome).
		* Audun does not yet have a team of Black Lotus special operatives at his disposal, although he has not let this fact become known in Gosterwick.
		* Alexia has gotten away with appointing officials in her own semi-legal town, but if it wer known Audun really is supposed to fill the Drome role as well as the mundane House of Sight, they might be less chill about her appointing her own spymaster into the Drome's hierarchy and claiming its authority.
*  3 4th-level Archontean fighter guards 

Services
* Send important and rapid messages through the postal services.
* Emissaries and dignitaries may contact this office as part of formally calling on Alexia or the Azure Knights (though not always).
* Most citizens, avoid it, afraid of falling under the Drome’s scrutiny.

##### The Private House

* AK-15
* A 25’ square, well-appointed town house.
* Home to the Private House, the branch of the imperial bureaucracy that administers the estates and financial perquisites belonging to the imperial family.
	* As yet, the imperial family owns no property in Gosterwick save for this structure, so the duties of the logothete are limited to collecting the taxes which by tradition belong to the emperor: market taxes (a flat fee per vendor, plus 10% of sales), a cartage tax (1 sp per axle leaving the city), and 50% of all proceeds from High Justice.
* Most citizens have little reason to visit the Private House. 
	* Lady Alexia just wants to make sure the emperor has no reason to fault her for skimping on his due.

### Religious

#### The House of the Saints

* AK-6
* An impressive Corinthian-style temple. The roof is 20’ above the floor and is supported by a set of stone columns on all four sides.
	* Originally a fane of the Twelve, it has been reconsecrated to the Immortal Flame and houses freestanding shrines to a variety of saints.
		* The shrines vary in size and sophistication; most contain only a covered altar, a locked stone chest for offerings, and various highly personalized ‘decorations’ meant to illustrate the saints main principles and deeds.  Each is staffed by volunteer (if highly dedicated!) lay priests.

People
* Each shrine has 1d10 lay priests who maintain the shrine, collect and make use of offerings, etc, but no true clerics.
* There is a 2-20% chance (depending on popularity) that a classed cleric (level 1d6+1) of a particular saint is visiting the shrine for 1d3 days.  They be persuaded to offer aid (for offerings, or notably devout followers of the saint), or instruct in the saint's ways.

#### Church of the Immortal Flame

* AK-7
* This church is new, raised by Alexia and the Knights when Gosterwick was first occupied.
* A circular structure of stone, fronted by a portico with an impressive pediment showing the the Pharos of the Immortal Flame and saints emerging to stride among worshippers, dispensing justice, healing, and other wonders.
	* An everburning brazier occupies the center, with an altar before it.  Stained-glass windows admit light, showing the works of the saints and faithful.
	* A toga-ed statue of Saint Basileus stands to one side, holding a pair of scales.  Worshippers place offerings in the right-hand side of the scales, hoping that saints will ‘balance the scales’ by helping their causes.

	* Cleverly set into wall circling the main shrine are the apartments and bureaucratic offices of the priests.

* Gesteon Probus (6th-level male Archontean paladin), defender of the temple
* 3 3rd-level clerics

* Training
	* Jador will train clerics of the Immortal Flame.
	* Gesteon will train clerics of the Immortal Flame and devout fighters.


#### Hall of the World-Ash

* AK-8
* A circular, thatched wooden hall in classic Thorcin style, open to the sky at the center, from which grows a great, gnarled ash-tree.  The front of the temple is screened away behind a row of fir trees, creating the feel of an isolated space in the forest.
	* This is a temple to the Thorcin gods, the Aesir.
	* A stone altar before the tree receive blood offerings from sacrificial animals, with a stone basin of water beside it.
	* There are firepits and space for dancing, oration, etc.  Standing stones ring the space, carved with runes and images of the gods.  Ritual objects adorn the walls (hammers, horns, spears, stag horns, etc)

	* Within the Hall, Svala can Turn Undead and do clerical magic, drawing on the Norse gods.
* Svala is not a member of a collegia, so is not supposed to teach mages.  She toes the line, but will break it if she finds favor with a Thorcin mage of the old ways.  She will trade in spells if the deal is good, even with Archontean mages.
	* Aethelwig the Golden (male Thorcin) of the Broom pays for her tutelage with his considerable thegn's-son cash.  He hates Archonteans and dabbles with the Reclaimers, and so has trouble getting training, despite his Imperial Academy pedigree.
* Svala knows a lot of legends of her people and might able to serve as a sage on such topics.
* Svala may do favors for people she sees as upholding Thorcin ways or people, but toes the line about being too overt (helping overt Reclaimers who might bring trouble back on her).
* Svala may buy treasures and magic items associated with Thorcin history or gods.

#### The Valkyr-steinn

* An ancient, natural standing stone carved with Thorcin runes and a badly-worn depiction of a figure extending a hand to a warrior, with a snake twining about the scene.
	* This is said to be a valkyrie gathering in a Thorcin warrior to join Odin's army in Valhalla.
	* In fact, it is a memorial to the Rudishva offering to elevate Thorcin warriors to become the first Varumani, with a kaliyani onlooker.
		* One might wonder why a Thorcin relic like this would have been left in place in an ancient imperial settlement.
* Svala and her people tend the stone, but there is no dedicated clergy.
	* Thorcin folk, especially warriors, leave offerings of mead, weapons, armor, iron coins, and arm-rings to ask for blessing in battle.
	* Sleeping by the stone is sometimes said to grant visions or prophetic dreams, or one may witness omens from it.

#### Shrine of Saint Demma

* AK-9

	* Inside, a peristyle supports a second floor while leaving the central space open to the roof.
		* Within the peristyle is a 30’x10’ plot of ever-fertile earth, planted with crops varying by month (wheat, barley, millet, hops, oats, rye, or sorghum).  By Demma's blessing, it is always fully-grown and ripe, always at peak ripeness. Twice per day, a magical rainfall drops on this plot from the roof.
		* A 15'-tall statue of the saint rises from the center of the plot: an Archontean woman dressed in formal toga, with a circlet formed of wheat stalks.
	* The second floor contains apartments for the priests, a barracks, supply rooms, and several meeting rooms.

People

#### Shrine of Lucreon and Thelis

* AK-10
* Thelis is a saint associated with ambition and achievement, and Lucreon is associated with wealth, politics, and statecraft.  They are personal favorites of Alexia, who had this shrine comissioned, and the priests are her steadfast allies.
	* Adventurers often come here, making offerings in hopes of riches, or paying off a vow they made in their delving.  Merchants and factors also visit, both to tithe to their patron, but especially as a means of reaching Alexia's ear.
	* Commoners are less fond of these saints and their priests.
* The dual shrine to Thelis and Lucreon is a classic, three-chamber structure.
	* The front  (ante-cella)is where clerics and the devout congregate.
	* The middle chamber (cella) is where the main rituals take place.
	* On the opposite side of the cella is the postern; it is unconnected to the cella and holds the administrative offices and apartments of the clergy.
* Within the cella are colossal granite statues of Lucreon and Thelis, side-by-side.
	* He orates, arm-raised, dressed in toga like an Imperial senator
	* Her dressed as a knight, offering a hand to draw one into adventure and fortune-seeking.
	* Offerings placed in her hand disappear, and coins rain from Lucreon's outstretched hand, as if he is dispensing largesse to the crowd, disappearing before they hit the ground (and appearing inside the hidden compartment within the altar for secret collection after hours).
		* During important rituals, a near constant stream of coins may be seen to come clinking down from thin air.

People
* Urdenna Belst, 8th-level female Archontean cleric, and chief devotee of Thelis
* Halidor the Observant, 7th-level male Thorcin cleric, and chief devotee of Lucreon
* 6 2nd-level clerics

Services
* The clerics will perform healing and other magics for suitable tithes.  They are less likely to do favors for the devout and virtuous than those in the shrine of Demma or the main church.
* Halidor will train any cleric who pays his fees.

#### Amphitheater of the Twelve

* On the northwest cliff of the hill of the gods, an abandoned amphitheater houses small shrines to the Twelve.
	* The cracked theater floor, with its back to the cliff, was for ceremonies, offerings, and plays.
	* Along the rear wall (away from the cliff) and twelve doorways into small shrines.
		* Most are dusty, faded, and cracked, but recognizable.
		* Ptah's shrine has been restored by the visiting dwarves.
		* Isis's shrine is swept, and small tokens are left by some goblins, who see her as their divine mother.
	* There are no clergy or services offered.

### Miscellaneous

##### Chapterhouse of the Benevolent Brotherhood

* AK-5
* A three-story wooden warehouse behind a smelly tangle of fishing industry (small dry docks, fishmongers, net-makers, etc).

		* There are no obvious stairs up to the higher floors.
		* Messages to the Brotherhood can be left with Dora, who places them in a small, concealed dumbwaiter.
	* The second and third floors are rooms where Brothers can meet, plan, and train.
		* Carousing it usually kept to taverns and homes, to avoid drawing attention to the warehouse.
	* The brothers use hidden entrances, never walking in through the front door.
		* Rowboats can enter a culvert that takes them from the lake under the warehouse, to access it via a hidden trapdoor.  Goods can be moved in and out, taken across the lake to deal with smugglers outside of town on dark nights.
	* The locals are poor fisherfolk and get a lot of nice handouts, and are friendly to the Brotherhood (mouths shut, rumors of snoops passed along and snoops hassled).

Brotherhood Structure
* 7 cells operate in Gosterwick, each made up of Brothers and Younger Brothers, overseen by a Big Brother.
* They can identify each other, but typically operate independently.

People
* Wicktrimmer (imperial goblin): Elder Brother of the Benevolent Brotherhood in Gosterwick.
	* Prefers to conceal his role in the Brotherhood behind the (successful) front of the Rarities Factor (AK-17).  The factor also provides a convenient cover for smuggling hot goods in and out of Gosterwick.

		* He only meets outsiders incognito at the cemetery. If he is willing to train thieves of the appropriate level, it will take place in a hired warehouse in the Outs or near the docks.
	* He is remarkably well-informed about what goes on in Gosterwick, thanks to a potent magic item that allows him to talk with corvids.
* Reesa the Hammer (AK-4)
	* Big Brother, her cell specializes in protection and extortion.
	* One of two Big Brothers who know the identity of the Elder Brother.
* Anders the Snake (6th male Archontean thief) (AK-5)

##### The Arcane Practitioners' Lodge

* AK-30
* Technically a private club catering to mages, the thinly-veiled raison d’etre for the institution is the training of arcane casters who can’t (or are unwilling to) get back to their collegium for ‘official’ training.
* A four-story tower, with the first three of heavy granite and the top floor of wood.
	* Ground floor: kitchen, dining room, and lounge for members only.

* Lyssandra Astorion, 7th-level, female Archontean magic user (Collegium Macrini)
* Pelte Greywand, 6th-level female Archontean illusionist (College of Perception)
	* Lyssandra and her partner Pelte, are lovers, adequate mages, but truly gifted entrepreneurs.
	* Their semi-legal arcane training has gathered 20,000 gp in coin and gems so far. They put just enough money back into the club (in spell books, scrolls, components, and alchemical supplies) to make it attractive for training, but are ready to flee if and when the authorities decide to close them down.
	* Pelte keeps a good ear out for gossip, politics, and rumors among the regional arcanist population (especially impending trouble for them).
	* They know Svala and are on polite professional terms with her.  She knows their scam and they know she may also be bending Collegium rules.
* A few cooks, staff
* Members
	* Adelrod the Grey (Thorcin male) of the Five Fingers of Destiny
	* Gyrde (Wiskin female) of the Bad Neighbors (her compatriot Idris One-Eye hates the Collegium Macrini, so she's avoided telling him Lyssandra trained there)
	* Trillis Galesson (male elf-blood human) of Arcane Vengeance, trained by Thorcin mages, no Collegium.  Trains with Svala, but wants to diversify, so has joined the Lodge precisely because it isn't Collegium approved.
	* Frida (Wiskin female) of Jellik's Jarls (Nova Schola Auctoritatis)
	* Grestain Fifty-Hides (Thorcin male) of Hama and Company
	* Jadeel the Soulless (Archontean female) of Discipline and Punish, illusionist who went to school with Pelte, flamboyant and needs a social group to pose in front of.
	* Cleopatra (Archontean female illusionist) of Lost and Found
	* Lissop the Shrog (Khumus male) of Lissop and flunkies.  Foreign mage of power close to that of the lodge leaders, as a foreigner with little familiarity with either Imperial or Thorcin customs, paying for a helpful social connection.  Slightly worrisome.

	* Klimt the Bodiless (his pitch-dark tent somehow reaches to both Newmarket and Narsileon, he has many eyes but no body, sibilant voice, much historic lore)
	* Helena the Unseen (mistress of the College of Perception in Narsileon, hates Tikun Thane for his messing with the Colleges of Cinders and Perception decades ago)
	* "Cerbactos Kalthetos", a Khumus prodigy who wow-ed his way into the Collegia over a century ago and rose to great height, taking an Archonteanized version of his name, Kerbog.  57 years ago, he stole several prized tomes and vanished, though rumor has placed him out here on the western frontier, perhaps heading back to his homeland?
	* Stories of an "Eighth Collegium", got the pair thinking of their scheme to teach via the club, but don't know more at the moment.
	* Chance to offer up magic-related current or historical rumors.
