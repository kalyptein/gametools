Iskander Basileon, aka Lord Burdock: A male Archontean aristocrat and prominent member of the Basileon clan. He has been awarded lordship over Burdock’s Valley by the exarch of Narsileon, over the loud objections of his half-sister, Alexia Basileon. Iskander’s claim is based on his descent from the last Archontean archon of Arden Vul, Uriel Basileon, who died when the city was sacked in 1783 AEP.
