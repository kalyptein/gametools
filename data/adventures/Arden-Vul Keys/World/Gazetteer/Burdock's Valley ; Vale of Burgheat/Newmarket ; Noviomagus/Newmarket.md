Founded as a frontier hub in the recent Archontean expansion, given privileges made an imperial (self-ruling) town to attract people to the ass-end of the north.


Newmarket is a free town whose elites elect their own mayor

Newmarket: A bustling new town on Irthuin, in the exarchate 
of Narsileon. Newmarket lies in the valley of Burdoc (q.v.), but 
is exempt from the lordship of Lord Burdock (q.v.); this fact has 
led to barely veiled hostility between the town’s leaders and Lord 
Burdock. Also known as Noviomagus. Population 4,000.

has holds for all four big factors



Isokrat the Even-Keeled: Male Archontean and chief priest of Enna in the town of Newmarket.

Josselin Rinstock: Female Archontean and mayor of Newmarket. 
She is anxious to preserve the ‘free’ status of Newmarket as a 
regional trading center against the claims of Lord Burdock.

Klimt: A strange, possibly bodiless, wizard with a ‘tent’ in both 
Newmarket and Narsileon. Visitors to the tent swear that it is 
bigger on the inside than the outside, even though it is somewhat 
hard to tell, since the tent is pitch black until Klimt’s many ‘eyes’ 
appear to inspect and question the visitor. Klimt speaks in a 
sibilant tone, and appears to have knowledge of events dating back 
many centuries. 

Tikun Thane: A powerful male Archontean mage, with a bad 
reputation among the collegia thanks to his manipulation of the 
colleges of Cinder and Perception many decades ago. Currently he 
is master of the Tower of the Ape in Newmarket. Tikun Thane has 
a secret connection to Arden Vul (see area SL3-2).
