Irthuin (IHR-thoo-een): A huge continent lying west of Mithruin 
across the Wine-Dark Sea. Its eastern coastline formed numerous 
provinces of the Archontean empire in antiquity, before the empire 
receded during the War of Sortians and Theosophs (q.v.). In 2639 
AEP, some 350 years ago, the empire returned, re-establishing 
exarchates in Narsileon and Arcturos, and subjecting the local 
Thorcin thanes to imperial authority. Eastern Irthuin is home to 
the Thorcinga. The middle of the continent is a vast swathe of 
old forest. The far west of the Irthuin is largely unknown to the 
Archonteans; there lie the endless steppes and the khanates of 
Khumus nomads. The largest elven realm, that of Lady Ellagel and 
Lord Gallador, also lies on Irthuin, amid the old-growth forests of 
the center of the continent. The legendary dwarven kingdom of 
Kazildor is said to rest beneath the mountains north and west of 
Narsileon. Irthuin is also known as Occidentos.


## Exarchate of Narsileon

#### Narsileon

Narsileon (nar-SILL-ee-on)
Important city on Irthuin, and the seat of an Archontean exarchate. After the retreat of the empire from Irthuin, Narsileon had been solely populated by Thorcinga for almost a thousand years. When the Archonteans returned to the western continent in 2639 AEP, they subjugated Narsileon and expelled many of its leading Thorcinga citizens so as to 
accommodate an Archontean ruling class of lords, merchants, and soldiers. Order is kept by the several legions quartered in its cantonments.
Population: 40,000.

Melchior the Magnificent: A roguish, male, Archontean magic 
user operating in the exarchate of Narsileon. Melchior has 
swindled several magic users out of their magic items. His family 
name is Macrinos.

Rudigar Red-Nail, called ‘the Finder’: Male Archontean ranger 
and ‘fixer’ for various good-aligned Archontean officials and insti-
tutions. He has worked frequently with (for?) Gedeon Ligareon. 
Few know that he is also a leading member of the Dawn Striders.

Wulfhere: Male Thorcin thegn of Moorleigh. Wulfhere is sym-
pathetic to the interests of the Thorcin Recovery League, but is 
more actively concerned about hill giant activity on the moors.

Epirenus
* (ep-ihr-EE-nus)
* A small town located on Irthuin in the exarchate of Arcturos. It is the center of Archontean viticulture.
* Population: 6,000

Frith’s Hearth
* A relatively typical Thorcin settlement about a week’s walk west of Narsileon. Its thegn is Cynefrith.

Magger
* A small town on Irthuin, in the exarchate of Narsileon. Magger is surrounded by numerous Archontean latifundia, large estates devoted to grain production. Also known as Magnus Ager.
* Population: 5,000.

Moorleigh
* A Thorcin settlement on the edge of the moors found north and west of Narsileon. Its thegn is Wulfhere.

Newfort
* A small town on Irthuin in the exarchate of Narsileon. It is known primarily as a military depot, where one of the Archontean legions resides on a quasi-permanent basis. Also known as Castrum Novum.

Cynefrith: Male Thorcin and thegn of Frith’s Hearth. Cynefrith is in 
his late 40s, with greying hair in warrior braids, and a badly scarred 
left-side of his face. He is staunchly anti-Archontean, and therefore 
is widely suspected to be a leader of the Thorcin Recovery League 
(although no evidence has yet linked him to their activities).

Eadric Strigona: The leader of the Thorcin Recovery League (q.v.). 
Although Eadric’s name is frequently invoked, he is almost never 
seen, leading some to wonder whether there actually is an Eadric 
Strigona, or whether his is just a name used to inspire confidence 
and/or fear.

Ellagel, Lady: Co-ruler of the largest Elven realm, a mysterious 
woodland far to the west of the exarchate of Narsileon.

Gallador, Lord: Co-ruler of the Elven realm west of Narsileon.

## Exarchate of Arcturos

#### Arcturos
* (ark-TUR-os)
* An important Archontean city located on Irthuin, and the seat of an imperial exarchate. Arcturos was reoccupied by the empire in 2639 AEP, after a long absence.
* Population 30,000.

Terchester
* A town on Irthuin in the exarchate of Arcturos. It takes its name from three ancient towers that loom over the skyline; these towers have no apparent means of ingress. Also known as Tricastrum.
* Population 4,200.

## The Iron Isles

* Several tiny islands located just off the east coast of Irthuin. The islands are semi-tropical and would be otherwise insignificant were it not for the substantial deposits of iron located here. In addition to several mines, the Archonteans operate a port and naval yard at Bedric’s Landing.

##### Bedric’s Landing

* This small settlement of miners and Archontean naval personnel is located in the Iron Isles.


## Wider Irithuin


Kazildor (KAZ-uhl-door): Kazildor is the subterranean realm of 
the dwarves of Irthuin, where the dwarven clans conduct the age-
old Endless War against their doppelganger enemies. The dwarves 
of Magae are notoriously reclusive and suspicious, and few humans 
have been permitted entrance to Kazildor. As a result, little is known 
of its size and structures, as those few dwarves who travel under the 
sun are oathbound to maintain the secrets of their people.

Sweetwater Hold (aka Haven)
* A town or city inhabited by pirates, criminals, and exiles from the Archontean Empire and the Caliphate.
* It is said that both geography and magical defenses bar access to those seeking harm to Haven.
* Its location is a closely guarded secret among the disreputable galley captains who call there.  All that imperial officials know of its location is that it lies far to the south of Arcturos, possibly along the coast of Ostralios.
	* It lies between the Caliphate and the Archontean exarchates of Irithuin, preying on trade between the great empires.
* Population: unknown.

Realm of Lady Ellagel and Lord Gallador: The chief elven realm 
in northern Magae. The Two Lords have ruled elvenkind for mil-
lennia, presiding over a culture that values balance in emotions, 
magical sensibility, knowledge, and connections to nature.
