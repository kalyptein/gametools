Pa'ut is neuroderm fluid, obtained by the ancient archonteans from the rudishva, as used to create the homunculi and doppelgangers.  It's secrets (and growth stock) are lost in the modern day.


The Pact of Ennius between the original sorcerer-kings of Archontos and the Seven Dragon Princes (aka "the Elder Allies")
* Detail kept secret for OPSEC
* Tribute was paid to the dragons, and their territories respected.  In return, they gave a certain number of eggs to Archontos to be raised among humans to aid them.  These dragons could shapeshift into human form and took on a anthrocentric outlook, including (often) human lovers.  They used their powers subtly for the most part, taking dragon form to strike only when needed.
* As the empire flourished, it needed direct dragon-violence less, and the dragons receded further under wraps.
* Tribute ceased, and new eggs were no longer forthcoming.  The existing imperial dragons longevity carried them along for centuries.
* They took sides in the Theo-Sortian war.  Many died, and since them most have died of age or gone dormant in secret places.


in Burdock Valley, there is a dungeon site that was where the elves underwent their change.  the baboon druid (an elf, or elf-blooded human) and some companion elves found it and accidentally interfaced with memory crystals left there.  Their personalities were warped and overwritten / synthesized.
- This happened decades ago, but only recently have elven druids arrived to try to find out what happened to them.
- Gerrilad went nuts and is trying to uplift baboons, a tangled notion of repeating the bioengineering work the rudishva did with varumani et al.
- The others are the niravari in the tomb of light.  they were more sane, and realizing their bodies were immune to the plague and they could go back in, they decided to try to find and harvest horus's god-corpse for energy to reengerize their ship / tech, or something?  they appear as elves who had bio and cyber altered themselves into something kind of gith-like

political parties / conflicts in Burdock
- Alexia / Azure Knights vs Iskander
	- who will claim the governorship?
	- the Azure Knights have their own interests; maybe worship of the old gods and seeking their lore and occult power?  or just cupidity?  Will they stay allied to Alexia?
	- Drome isn't directly aiding anyone, just keeping an eye.  Both sides would like to sway them to their side.
	- Brother and sister both represent larger political alliances back home (Narsileon, Archontos, etc) and struggles within the Basileon family.
	- Both want to sway the mayor of Newmarket, an independent imperial town, to their cause, as well as the local legionary commanders, the factors, collegia, etc.
	- Benevolent Brotherhood looking to make bank off the conflict.  Vengeance factors circling, carefully.
- return of Set
	- set cult vs Drome vs Drome
	- the Drome is officially (secretly) trying to prevent the return of Set, but there are double-agents allied with the cult for their own ambitions
	- will the cult be able to win over other players, such as Alexia, Iskander, the factors, the Vengeance Factor, the Benevolent Brotherhood, etc?
- Thorcin uprising
	- the Reclaimers vs imperial authority.
	- Banditry, sympathizers in town passing intel
	- Would they ally with Alexia temporarily to weaken her brother?
	- Can they persuade the elves to aid them?  Think of the mob-murder of the elf-lord in Archontos those centuries ago, you can't trust these imperials!
- Elves
	- seeking Gerrilad and co, who vanished.
	- use the all-elf Arcane Vengeance company of adventurers (make them druids and fighter-druids, with one too-human half-elf who is a mage, Trillis)
- Imperial collegia vs Kerbog and the Priscians
	- some in the collegia are just mad about opposition to their power, some fear stirring up the past in AV where the Sortian/Theosoph war that almost ended the empire began.
	- Some just want to race to claim AVs lore and legacy for the collegia
- Poisoners vs Drome
	- there is a grieving, vengeful noble youth here, looking to end the poisoners responsible for the death of their family member.  he's dragged his sister with him, as their family fortunes have diminished.  she doesn't want to pursue this, preferring to make the best of their remaining fortunes, but he won't relent.
		- or swap the genders
	- the drome want to get the recipe for Mortality, or even gain control over the Plumthorn group
- Kaliyani infiltrators vs humanity?
- Heqeti vs humanity
	- The Dawn Striders may be aware of threats such as the Heqeti, Kaliyani, and Setties, and be working against them, seeking heroes to join them from among the adventurers.
- Varumani flex?
	- Might the return of humans to the valley and intrusion into AV lead the thegn to look outward, maybe stake a claim?
	- Could ally with Alexia or Iskander or the Thorcins.
- Doppelgangers vs Dwarves
	- Doppels might be interested in Heqeti slime-god?  Or vice versa?

* Factors
	* Seeking gain from the riches of AV
* Vengeance Factor
* Benevolent Brotherhood
* Crimson Trust
* Drome


* Zorak the dwarf smith was high priest of Ptah, a legendary mage-smith
* dwarf - doppelganger war?  make the doppelgangers a spy-weapon created during the Theosoph / Sortian war that's still going, doing its own thing now.  Paut-brothers to the homunculi.
