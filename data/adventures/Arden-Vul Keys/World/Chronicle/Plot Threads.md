* People are going to notice the moved colossus of Arden.  In the not too far future, others will begin to figure out how to use it.
	* Whether it is at the top or bottom of the Long Stair on arrival will vary.

* Theo sold Lover's Token to Alexia, favorable impression from family

* Fimbul has begun training and acting as an agent for Mr. Shade
	* Mr Shade is the nickname his pawns have given to the chief agent reporting to "merchant" Priasson Kaledor of the Drome.
	* Fimbul and fellow trainees meet in "the Barn" to receive mentoring.  In return they are tasked with simple "gathering intel" work around town, keeping the boss aware of goings on.  He tests them to see who is talented and reliable, a prospect to be brought in deeper.

* Astrid trains with the town guard, with Captain Neolynda Gastevean at the southern Kettle.
	* She defuses a ruckus between a general store merchant and mage Hrodulf Ice-Blood and his flunkies who were bullying him over his prices.  Generally makes a good impression.

* Volun returns home to do her training at her fastness in the Old Forest.


* spreading rumors dissuading people from harming the Great Tree in the Grand Forum
* more rumors against interfering with Lankios as well, "be kind to strangers"


August training

* Mr Shade sends Fimbul to observe a setite "thief-mark", asks him to keep an eye out for (Setite) activity of them in "red and black" in the ruins.

Theo reads more historical text...

Marius Tricotor (aka Marius Invictus, or Marius the Unconquered): 
An ancient Archontean military hero and archon of Arden Vul in the early years of the Archontean presence.
After his glorious conquest of the hoppers and his cowing of the Arden Vul trolls, Marius Tricotor ordered a special complex built at the foot of the Great Chasm "so as to keep perpetual watch, lest their evil rise again".


Astrid overhears...
Strange dragonflies flit about the underground areas. Their eyes appear to be formed of gems. Some of them can actually speak!  The speaking ones will try to bargain with you- offering information or healing in return for gems.

* Fimbul will notice unfamiliar "thief-sign" in town (actually Setite cult marks)

- Rudigar Red-Nail, "the Finder" meets Astrid as they patrol the roads together, rangers and guards.

Fimbul has a cursed penny (ancient silver penny, false luck, +5 to next roll, then -5 / -25%)
* decursed by Halidor the Observant, priest of Lucreon, penny sealed away in temple's accursed item vault.


September training

Mr Shade asks Fimbul to check in on rumors that Helena the Unseen, mistress of the College of Perception in Narsileon has sent an agent, a mage named Vulpe Xenarcheon to investigate a number of arcane criminals in the region.  He's in Newmarket currently.

Theo dines w/ Alexia, Horatius Gesellion (captain of the Azure Knights), some Newmarket merchant factors (Golden Band and Prosperity Factor), and Durdeon Vislok, the young noble from the Sodality of the Fist.
* she broaches the topic of the Lost Regalia quest
* Neferet, one of the last high priestesses of Thoth held the iron circlet

Rudigar calls on Astrid to seek the missing canonness from Newmarket.  She and her party went to see the colossi and the falls, did not return.  Her party is found slain, her missing.  A dead rat and goat beastman are there.
* Abducted Canon quest

Frida (wiskin, pretty, a bit naive and ambitious, Jellik's Jarls, Nova Schola) asks Theo if he knows anything of "the flooded canyon".  He later finds a passage in his history text:
"Within the Halls lies a massive flooded canyon filled with tombs that predate the empire and said to house great riches. It is easily accessed from the shrine of Marius."

Asking Klimt of Newmarket sage questions
* thothian teleporters, activation squares

Rescued Gerrilad's prisoners.  Each shares rumors they heard.  Have joined the Savage Heart as junior members.

Jost
The Great Chasm is an important route to the lower levels. Or so my sources said. The problem? A tribe of trolls lives in the chasm. They ride on top of tamed giant spiders so they can scamper up and down the chasm walls. Avoid it, mate! It's death to try the chasm.

Tresti
The Archontean Collegia are deeply interested in the artifacts still lying unclaimed in the halls. 
"Eighth Collegium", Tikun Thane, and Cerbactos Kalthetos

Samantha the Red
One of the dragonflies with gems for eyes spoke to us in the ruined halls near the Forum of Set. It asked us if we had seen its children. It said that its master was a great wizard would enrich us beyond our dreams if we found the children and returned them. Theo grabbed a goblin and, next time we saw one of the dragonflies, tried to claim it was one of the kids. The dragonfly was having none of it and laid a curse on Theo.

Gwelf
Told of the cultic languages, and lifestones.


Theo meets his end in a gelatinous cube.

Tresti Iredell joins the main party.
* Collegium of Cinders (hoped her elven blood would aid elementalism)

Building a small tower expansion to the manor: the Savage Heart Lodge
* servants (3 maid, cook, handyman), 1 chief servant (clerk / chartoulios), 1 sergeant, 21 guards (watches of 7 at a time)
	* living-in: sergeant, cook, clerk

Everyone knows they found the legendary lost treasury of Thoth.  Celebs!

Theo confided Alexia's interest in the four pieces of the archon's regalia to Astrid.
* Alexia contacts Astrid, interested in her continuing that quest.

The leader of primal vengeance speaks with them.  He knows Gerrilad & Sigeric (and companions) had found ancient documents and relics that implied elves had dwelled in the region of Burdock's Valley and maybe even within Arden Vul long, long ago.  That's what brought them here.
* Elven history emerges from the mist slowly from thousands of years ago.  They were wanderers, few in number.  Vague tales of a terrible catastrophe, of fleeing plague and war, of losing everything.  Gradually they developed their magics, intermingled with humans, in war and peace, and slowly occupying their hidden fastnesses.



reading books
* history of Thoth's priesthood will talk a bit about the upper levels, the setites, ptah, bast
* doesn't describe the Old Ones physically

A Setite pilgrim buys one of the Set Animal Masks they sold.  Mr Shade has him followed to the cliff (joined by a couple others) but loses him in the night.  He sees a red light blinking up on the cliff face west of the colossus of Arden.  Believes people are coming and going, subtle pilgrims to Set.  Suggests infiltration *might* be a possibility?

Rescuing Gerrilad's prisoners and paying for Gwelf to be healed of his trauma madness convinces Rudigar to want to induct her into the Dawnstriders.
* They have oracular pronouncements indicating that ancient evils are returning to the roots of a forgotten place (which some Dawnstriders have come to believe may be Arden Vul) seeking what has been lost.  Should they regain it, terrible darkness shall befall the lands of men.
* There will be a child of the earth and heavens who will rise to oppose the darkness.
* Astrid's varumani genetics are waking back up (exposure to ambient arcanum? rudishva influences?), especially triggered by "death", Kung Fu Hustle style getting beat to a pulp allows her body to regenerate stronger.  More strength, speed, etc.  Might even get a little taller, or gain other varumani abilities (improving trollkin poison, cold, etc resistance).
* 
* local members
	* Guthram the Bald (male Thorcin): spice merchant of Salt and Savor.
		* among his distant elven contacts is another member
	* Rudigar
* membership allows Astrid to exchange letters, draw on advice and knowledge, kind of a free, low-end sage, takes a month to hear back.


Volun perishes to an ambush of centipedes in the ruins of arden vul
* her body is returned to her kin, and she is buried in the Old Forest to nourish a new tree

A crusader cleric of the Immortal Flame, a Dawnstrider, joins the party.

Divine Breath of Thoth book
* mention of several shrines in which trials can be faced to gain boons, but at risk to body, mind, and spirit.  two such trials are described, requiring the Pneuma of Thoth.
* SL2-1C: The Trial of Thoth the Scribe
	* must be under the influence of the pneuma to withstand the ordeal
	* read or write
		* read cosmic secrets; can permanently expand the mind, granting insight or magical gifts, failure can permanently weaken the intellect
		* write to empty the mind; give up memories, secrets, comprehension of spells; try to fill the void with fresh knowledge and abilities; failure means the offerings are lost to no gain.
* SL2-1G: The Trial of Thoth the Resurrector
	* must be under the influence of the pneuma to withstand the ordeal
	* tread the paths of the dead and the of the reeds, guided by wisdom
	* fail and have your mortal span is sacrificed
	* succeed and you will be given a token of perfect healing and resurrection


Mr Shade informs Fimbul about maybe infiltrating the pilgrims of Set
* find out how they are contacted by pilgrims?  How to seek to blend in?

false ids, established by The Shade for infiltrating Set's cult
Fimbul - "Tenebrix", local goblin rep for fictional noble "Atravos Xenarcheon"
Tresti - "Velanex Caligoris", also an employee of Atravos

Local legend of the Childmonger
* When the party drops by Creon's he mentions a curious tale he's recently heard.
	* A local herdsman came in to sell a fragment of a stone tablet he found in the fields, as happens often enough.  He saw Creon polishing up a gold solidi and made a warding gesture.  When asked why, he told the tale of the Childmonger, a local legend of Burdock Valley.
* From time to time, appears in the night to a family unable to care for all their children and buys one; paying with ancient gold solidi.
	* Said to be tall and pale, dressed all in black, but people can't recall more.
	* The children are always healthy ones, boys or girls.
* This is Melok-Ri, obtaining children who will grow up in the Sun-Scarred Knights, as varlets and servants, promoting to knights if they excel.
	* His mesmerism erases most memory of his appearance.

Creon was sold a piece of ancient military insignia; the symbol of the Sheepshead Rangers (i.e., the imperial IInd Legion, the legion that got destroyed with Adrienic a few centuries ago.  Learning their fate would be of interest to the empire.


Balthazar the Blue and Grimley (Lost & Found) and Hama (Hama & Co) meet to drink occasionally, invite Astrid...
The beastmen admitted that their queen, Dido, has a desperate need for a rare type of subterranean mushroom called 'cloud caps'. They can be identified by their mottled blue-and-white caps.

Tresti find's Theo's book of history at the Lodge...
The temple of Set only arrived in Arden Vul after the ibis priests had been there for many years, and consequently were always playing catch-up to their rivals. Their holy sites, for instance, could only be accessed from the cliff face, and not from the city proper.

Setites pretending to be adventurers rob and slaughter a merchant caravan heading for Gosterwick from Newmarket, carrying off several victims as slaves/sacrifices.
* Apart from material gain, they hope it will sour people on adventurers, impeding Gosterwick's growth and its intrusions into Arden Vul.
* Iskander may be under Setite sway (subtle, if not actively accepting their aid) and start holding up caravans with security checks, hindering his half-sister.
* Mr Shade's informants report the "adventuring company" who joined as guards did not previously exist.  But since Gosterwick turnover is high, it's hard for merchants to know who's on the up-and-up.


Ran into Primal Vengeance in the Temple of Thoth (3-71), they headed north and rescued Susarra from 3-83, claimed the treasure from her dead companions, saw the one-way door into the catacombs (but had been in there before), and headed back elsewhere.

Ran into The Broom near 3-51.  They were going to the obelisk, seeking to tap the power of Tsathoggua, since they're all chaotic evil.
* Might bear some fruit?  Maybe they'll be sacrificing victims to it soon?

At the next meeting with Hama, Balthazar, and Grimley...

Lost and Found has been heading into the southern caves more, meeting Beastmen
"The beastmen are looking for a shrine to their ancestor, a dog called Rex. Apparently this dog is now a god, whose bark has the power to kill. They're willing to trade good information in return for the location of Rex."

Gerrilad is slain, and Isocritis fled.
* Gerrilad's corpse left on Yrsko's bed heap

Gerrilad's crazy baboon notes given to Primal Vengeance
* it's half primal magic and half incomprehensible rudishva bioscience

the Deeds of Marius Tricotor, by Lucius Cornelius Scriptor
* Lucius Cornelius Scriptor was a friend of Marius, so of the same time
* 893 AEP: Arden-Vul founded, first archon, delving begins
	* eventual contact with Varumani, Rudishva, and heqeti
	* at some point after conflicts arise with the locals, MT becomes archon
		* prior archon was "Cassandra", who warred with the heqeti inconclusively
			* Her forays discovered the Drowned Canyon, where her tomb was eventually raised.
		* Marius' personal life was tragic.  His wife died in childbirth and he never remarried, their daughter lived, but she died young.  He adopted a son, Phocius, who was slain by the hoppers.
* 1043 AEP: Refta, thegn of the varumani submits to MT, pays tribute
* 1051 AEP: MT defeats the heqeti and drives them from their subterranean ziggurat
* 
* historical note: goblins didn't exist at this point, and the beastmen don't appear to be present
* 
* what does it say on levels 3, 4, and 6
	* surface
		* identifies the ToS, pyramid of thoth, archon's palace, donjon, statues of arden and vul at opposite ends of the pair of bridges
	* level 3: 3-1 to 3-162
		* 300' down
		* south of the greater hall of columns, east of the great hall, lies the chief administrative complex of the cult of thoth in the precincts.
		* the great hall lies south of the three mysteries of thoth.  A statue of Thoth, the Overseer of Truth watches from the high balcony that rings the hall in its unseen heights.  it bustles with the voices and footsteps of diligent clerks, priests, and administrators coming and going across the Precincts.
	* level 4: 4-1 to 4-122
		* 400' down
		* no direct routes from the city proper.
			* most pilgrims come through the grand entrance on the cliff face, to the left of the colossus of Arden, at the top of the of the Short Stair; from there, one travels north to the chamber of the blue pillar.  From there, travelers go either west and north to reach the Red Bridge of Set and the Stair of Commerce with leads to the Forum proper, or east and up the  long stair to the halls of the Guild of Service.
				* From the forum, Set's Way ascends to the Temple of Set, placed at equal altitude to Thoth's temple.  There one may behold the great idol and the numerous shrines to Set's aspects.  One that displays a lesser Mystery is the crocodile idol of Set-Sobek which offers jeweled tears when given a limb to sever.
			* those who would descend from the city usually must cross the great cavern in the south of the Precincts of Thoth.  There in the west is a stair that leads down, eventually reaching the chamber of the blue pillar.
				* there are plans to build a route to this stair through the natural caverns southwest of the Great Hall, to create a more direct route.
			* mentions
				* a necropolis of Set, where higher ups in the politically connected cult of Set could be laid to rest.
				* in the eastern reach, we drove the heqeti from a sacrificial cavern of bones.
				* northern caves used as a recreational hunting ground for wild beasts and sacrificial slaves
				* crowds would come to witness the performance of the three Mysteries of Set.
	* level 5: 
		* 500' down
		* reading between the lines, this level (hall of 40 pillars, obsidian gates) is level 5 by ancient archontean reckoning
	* level 6: 6-1 to 6-18 (Troll Lift) and 6-53 to 6-92 (Arena)
		* 1100' down (?!?!)
			* the troll lifts don't exist yet (won't until after AV falls)
			* contrary to the text, the Inn of the Lost isn't created inside a former thothian admin complex, it existed from before archontos arrived, the House of Isocorax (not yet an inn, just his haven of peace)
		* beside the black gulf of the great chasm, where twin waterfalls distantly roar, a great balcony gazes out
			* floating within the chasm, a stone isle supports a wondrous garden.
			* northwest lies the House of Isocorax, a place of peace and hospitality.
			* northeast lies a great hall flanked by statues leading to an ancient arena, once the site of terrible heqeti rituals.  with their defeat, the Old One, Crallicarus, has assumed the mantle of Lord of the Arena, hosting grand gladiatorial spectacles there.
* what does it say of the war against "the amphibians"
	* they are inimical to humanity and worship a loathsome elder god, an entity of slime, chaos, and endless hunger
		* Scriptor compares them to the "ophidians" who warred with early Archontos, inhuman monsters in service to their elder god, Yig.
	* their presence in the caverns is ancient, they predate the varumani, perhaps all others
		* they created grotesque toad/salamander-like idols in the halls
		* the areas they worked have a pitted, eroded look, and an oily sheen
	* the heart of their domain is in the utmost depths, but their reach extends upward
		* they were seeking to summon the demon prince, Kauket, soul and messenger of their elder god.
		* MT and his forces eventual cast down their profane ziggurat and broke their power.
		* MT had a complex built at the foot of the Great Chasm "so as the keep perpetual watch on the hoppers, lest their evil rise again"
* of the "trolls", the varumani
	* like great trollkin, bestial trolls are the least among them
	* they value strength and dominion, warriors all
	* they possess a number of mysterious magics and enchanted weapons
	* regard the heqeti as "ancient enemies", and are locked in a slow war with them when humans arrive.
		* they start out clashing with archonteans as a challenge, than legit war, then occasionally cooperating against the heqeti, then finally submitting to archontos and paying tribute; together the war against the heqeti is won.



Keqemander demon, eventually goes down to the heqeti, via the great chasm.
* They try to use the Broom to recover the box in town, and get revenge.

* Oziman slain
* Nesma'ut the +2 longsword claimed!  Forged by the priests of Horus


* thief minions on cliff-watching duty, trying to learn how the Setites signal for passage


* Astrid impossibly survives beheading.
* Gifted the Iron Circlet of Ghanor to Alexia, was named head of her own sept of the Azure Knights, given a suit of +2 banded mail with suitable azure insignia.



Tresti discerns that there is tech, magic, and also some magi-tech (like the useful palms)
* the magic part of the magi-tech is also an unfamiliar tradition (kaliyani), more so than something like Thorcin or Ramaali magic.




## Current

Aelia walks past the Valkyrstein, sees the tall horned figure and thinks of the alien bones in Tresti's lab.

Merchants and travelers to Gosterwick attacked by "adventurers" (Setites stirring up trouble)
general banditry
- Iskander blames Reclaimers (some, but also Setites slavers, lizardmen pressured by kaliyani allies of Setites?), pushes for control over Gosterwick roads, Newmarket

Kaitor attacks
* as the blue fire of thoth drags at him, ectoplasmic replay of his confrontation with Guvriel
	* kaitor and guvriel and lankios, minor injuries, look worn and haggard
	* finds her packing.  "you're leaving?! abandoning your duties when our survival teeters on the knife's edge?"  "why not?  it's the perfect ending for this complete farce.  I see no reason to die alongside my fool husband.  where is lankios?" (voices rising)
	* "you think he will go with you?  lankios would never forsake his sacred honor", "for me he will" *stab*
	* guvriel falls, revealing lankios looking on in shock, he flies into a rage, slaying kaitor, who tries to speak to him
	* lankios stumbles away, hollow eyed, leaving the tablet behind, his men watching him go, left with the bodies
* Lankios has woken as if from a long, restless dream.  He is tired, seeming older and frailer, but lucid.

Lankios leaves his valuables at the Savage Heart


Have Rudiga the Traitor be somewhere in Arden-Vul as an undead or something
* Vanara wants his guts, and his destruction would appease Druva's wight
* Put him with the Kaliyani; they unearthed his bones from their crypt in Lissak-Tol and reanimated him to help guide them back to Arden Vul and advise them in their search

Why did Rudiga betray the hegemony / varumani?
* He fled with the kaliyani when the varumani / Vanara survived the attack, knowing they'd kill him as soon as they realized what he'd done.
* He was envious of Vanara's position, and chafed under the authority of the rudishva.
	* He might even have agreed with Melok-Ri and Isok-Crix about conquest.
* He plotted with Lisstak to remove Vanara and Druva during the invasion.  He would become leader of the Varumani and lead them out of Arden Vul to dominate the human lands beyond, bringing looted wealth and tech with him.


Do Silent Tempest and Kunda get clear of the Midnight Road?
* They do make it.  Kunda feels indebted to the Savage Heart.


Fimbul has had his people trying to eavesdrop on Setite activity.  The actual cult operatives are being pretty professional, but some adventurer's are less circumspec.
* Dalton's Darlings has used the Forum for resupply.  They didn't leak anything about the cult (probably not in their trusted circle), but mentioned a goblin "renegade" named Gislu who was in the Forum with her followers.  They offered to serve as guides and henchlings to Dalton, seeking some tomb and an artifact within.  The Darlings were discussing whether to follow up and take the job, or maybe just jump the goblin and beat the full story out of them.  Dalton reminded them not to start shit in the Forum, which is neutral turf, and if the Guild hauls them off in chains for starting a fight, he's cutting them loose.
* Fimbul think's the Darlings are by and large, terrible people, but that Dalton is actually a bit better.  He might actually be keeping them from being worse, possibly so his ego can feel like he's a benevolent leader.

When they next pass through Gog's cave, they see him conversing with a tall man (Cinna Minux).  The man melts away and vanishes (turns to mist) when he spots them.
* Gog's vague about having talked to him, or who he is.  "Just a friend"



Speak With Dead Set Acolyte
1. What was your name? (so we know what to call you),
	1. Demetrios of Epirenus
2. What are the rules for non-cultists in the Set settlement? (so we can blend in better),
	1. Visitors must present themselves for inspection at the entry.  They must abide by the 10 laws of the Forum, which govern buying and selling, not starting trouble, and not working magic.  They may not stray beyond the public areas.
3. What is your job when you aren't scouting the dungeon? (so we can blend in better),
	1. I was an Acolyte of Set.  I served as my superiors commanded, assisted with rituals and rites to the glory of Lord Set, and led groups of guardsmen to keep order in the Forum.
4. What spells do you normally have memorized? (so we can blend in better),
	1. command, cure light wounds, curse, protection from good; hold person, silence 15’ radius.
5. What kinds commands can you give Set acolytes and Set guards? (so we can blend in better),
	1. Acolytes are the lowest rank of the clergy, but above the guardsmen and common cultists.  Unless speaking orders from a superior, I have no authority over fellow acolytes.  Guards will obey unless it contradicts their duties given by superiors.  The sergeants and sha-guards are of equal rank to me, and so are not required to obey, but might defer to my blessed status.

6. Who sent you on your mission to scout the shaft on Level 3? (so we know who might know you well),
	1. I was dispatched, along with several exploratory patrols to various regions, by Pontifex Lacedaion, Third Priest of Set.
7. Who else was on the mission with you? (so we know who is missing),
	1. My fellow acolyte Lukon and I each led a handful of guardsmen (he lists the names he remembers).
8. Where in the settlement of Set do you usually sleep when you aren't on a mission? (so we know where you might call home)
	1. I sleep in the dormitory of the acolytes.
9. Who is the leader of your faction? (so we know who we are after),
	1. Pontifex Stephania, First Priestess of Set, High Priest of the Halls of Arden Vul
10. Where do you get your food from? (so we could plan some sabotage),
	1. Some is brought in by merchant pilgrims, some conjured by higher ranking priests, some acquired through tax or trade from the dwellers of the Halls, such as goblins and beastmen, who come to the Forum, and some is hunted or gathered from the wild caverns.

11. What is your relationship to the leader of your faction? (so we know if we should avoid them),
	1. I obey her without question as the Voice of Set.  She once honored me at the daily performance of the Second Mystery; my name read among a handful of others who had recently served well.
12. Who is your closest living ally in the cult? (so we can avoid them),
	1. Sergeant Heraclion, leader of Gamma Sept.
13. What is the most common passwords you use in Set Cant? (so we can blend in better),
	1. Sometimes we use phrases from doctrine, such as "I am strong / but Set is stronger"
14. What circumstance do you use [the most common passwords]? (so we can blend in better),
	1. We do not usually need passwords.  The Forum is not so large yet; those of consequence - clergy, sergeants, officials, and such - recognize each other.  Suspicious individuals will be interrogated by magic or torture.  One-off passwords are sometimes used in the field, to identify oneself when approaching out of the dark.  Lukon and I had decided on a challenge of "Sobek's tears", met with "aquamarine".
15. What is the name of a holy book you study from? (so we can blend in better)
	1. The Dogmatics of Father Set

Uriel Basileon's body and archon's regalia was returned to Alexia
* Iskander grows desperate as her star rises, and the Setite assassins will soon strike


The Sandstorm Gate opens and the Setites send in a party of skilled adventurers/assassins to try to reclaim the Forum and kill the PCs.  If they're defeated, that'll end their efforts

Iskander grows desperate as her star rises, and the Setite assassins strike

1 - death
2 - coma?
3 - struck down but saved by intervention
4 - narrow survival at a cost
5 - plot thwarted
6 - triumph, capture / injury?  something learned

* Alexia is assassinated
	* She is poisoned at a banquet.
		* A trusted servant was Suggested to deliver a poisoned drink (the wizard slipped in invisibly and did the magic, delivered the venom).
		* The poison was a distilled and magically-enhanced (blessed/cursed) form of set animal venom, painful and lethal by wound or ingestion.
		* Alexia had an heirloom shard of unicorn horn to test food and drink for poison, but it was swapped with a fake.  No one has realized yet.
			* Iskander knew she had it (there are a handful of matching pieces spread though the family) and could describe it enough for a forgery to be made.
	* After she succumbed, her body was moved to her quarters and the priests sent for.
		* The wizard staged a distraction attack against the Azure Keep (flying in, fireballs, summoned monsters, illusions, confusion) to draw out the knights.
			* Some people think an attempt was being made on the Knight-Commander as well, or some kind of general attack on the knights.
		* Two were left to guard the body.  The assassin slipped in and killed them, then cut out Alexia's heart to prevent her from being raised.
			* Considered especially disrespectful by the Setites, as the egyptian seat of the soul.
			* She can be resurrected, but no priests outside Aelia are powerful enough.
		* The thief meanwhile broke into the safe below the Residence and stole the Iron Crown of Ghanor (it was wizard-locked by Alexia and alarmed to warn if magic was used against it)
			* ??? how did the thief get in then?

	* Fimbul lost contact with one of his informants in the town (captured and tortured/magicked to extract info); they knew (and were know, it turns out) to the  Setites.  From there they launched a probe on the Residence's sercurity.
		* the informant was killed and ditch in the wilds
* Iskander "survives" an assassination attempt, a suggested servant given poison to add to drinks, but spotted and slain by a guard (cut-out removed to prevent investigation)
	* Iskander immediately moves to "secure" the situation, hunting for the assassins who killed his half-sister.
	* Knight-Commander Horatius Gesellion (9th-level male Archontean fighter) officially rules Gosterwick, but doesn't have the cash to keep bankrolling it.  Iskander does, and is pressing to take over on that front (he's the lord, after all).
* Nicetas the bailiff, Iskander's representative, is in town, conferring with the Knights.  The rep does not know what's going on, he's acting in good faith (though of course pressing to extend his lord's power and control).

Setite Party (9th - 11th level-ish) - The Darkened Sun
* Assassin - Maerwynn the White
	* thorcin woman, pale, white-blonde hair, beautiful
	* thin bladed dagger of venom, magic red-copper ring (a Ring of Set?)
* Thief - Dioscorus
	* archontian man
* Wizard - Valeria Philopona
	* archontean woman, student of the New School of Arcane Might
* Cleric of Set - Trygil Aelwold
	* thorcin/half-elven man
* Paladin of Set - Sir Acherres
	* archontean man

Notes
* Servant devils/demons/set animals
* The Darkened Sun are present in town as a new adventurer group "Fool's Luck"; apparently led by Dioscorus and Trygil.  first "arrived" a few weeks ago
	* They are living under Undetectable Alignment (24 hours, 2nd wiz, rev of Know Alignment) and Nondetection (3rd, 1 hr/level, wizard saves to block scrying)
* iron crown is currently in Setite hands (Stephania's vault), held for Iskander's good behavior, to be granted when he's proven sufficiently loyal
* 
* next goal is to go after the Savage Heart core members; Astrid and Aelia are first in line, being the most well known
	* may come at Aelia when she's in public as a priest, in her cathedral?
	* maybe arrange some discovery / informant for Astrid to question who then explodes or releases a demon or something?

Astrid gifted Hama and Company with a complete set of thothian teleporter activation squares and a list of all their well-explored addresses.
* H&C had very poor luck getting them previously, so this was a great boon to them.


TBD
* clear the level 3 Temple of Set
	* The Falcon Five have asked Astrid to rescue their companion from the Setites
	* What of the Anchoress, prisoner for many years?
* interact with the kaliyani near the Setites on level 4


With both Alexia and Iskander dead...
* the knights are in charge...or are they? (see below)
* the "folk of the wood" drift off, settites and bandits.  there is more peace on the roads without the slavers and saboteurs.
* imperial drome, officials, and Basileon investigators will be arriving with questions
	* eventually a new lord will be appointed by the Exarch.  Will it be another Basileon, someone of another house?
	* who will step forward to pursue the Basileon high table?  will the want anything to do with Arden Vul?
* savage heart money is needed to keep Gosterwick running as it is, or serious taxes must be raised

Alexandros (Set library prisoner) knows and may offer historical info about Arden Vul for considerations:
* Fragments of information suggesting the existence of a hidden Sortian (now, ‘Priscian’) complex under Arden Vul (i.e., 9-58 to 9-64).
	* Some had visited the Forum in disguise.  The ophidian allies identified them, and mentioned their presence in the depths, in what Alexandros thinks he has identified as an ancient Sortian outpost, at or near the base of the Chasm.  Settite contacts back in Archontos were able to dig things up on the Priscians (name Nerub Null and explain their doctrine).
* Settite alliance with "the ophidians", known only to Stephania, Belisarius, and himself.
	* They tunneled into Stephania's quarters.  She saw their serpentine nature as a good omen from Set, and they struck a pact.  Belisarius didn't trust them.  Alexandros was read in to do research in the library for any details on them (apart from frescos and murals here and there in ancient times, and a brief mention by an Old One that they had been here in ages past, there's no sign of them in the history he could access).
	* They made a secret chamber to serve as an embassy to the Forum.
	* From what he understands, they mostly they traded information with Stephania, news from the upper levels for news from the lower levels.  Alexandros was not privy to their talks, but occasionally got questions from Stephania to research, presumably based on things they had said.
* Setite search for the Archon's regalia to give to Iskander
	* Divinations of Set led to the Bone Ring of Jagri-Naz, in the hands of one of the Old Ones, called Saloricus.  He was not interested in trading / selling, so they dispatched thieves sent to get it (who did not return).  He's on Level 5, directions to reach him can be had, north of the chasm, near the troll lift.  The know he's some kind of powerful sorcerer.
	* Among the ancient records of Set, the priests describe trying to get their hands on the Tablet of the Beacon (Thoth and Horus priests too), but the archons held out, keeping it in "Marius Tricotor's old forward post in the depths".  When they tried to scry it out, the were blinded by a vision of Sekhmet in her glorious rage.
	* They know nothing of the ebon spear's location.

Alexia is back!
* Astrid pays the 3 years of life to restore her with the rod of resurrection
* she largely handles all the political repercussions and finances of Gosterwick
* she is immensely grateful to Astrid and heeds her in all things


* Deck of Many Things / Magi
	* Astrid: gem (50 gems x 1000 gp)
		* When she smashes the Set-Sobek croc idol, it shatters into a bunch of aquamarines.
	* Aelia: skull (fight death)
		* He's mad she tampered with death after saying she wouldn't.
	* Delila: sun (50k xp + misc magic item)
	* Tresti: shaman (permanently lose a 2nd level spell slot)
		* It's now occupied by a spirit of Thievery that came back from the card-induced vision-quest; she can understand Thieves' Cant.


* process the books from the Setite library

* spymaster's letter and the invisible rudishva chest
	* This is Constantius, who drank hemlock and died as the city fell into chaos. 
	* His last testament lies before him.
		* It is strangely personal and emotional, with numerous underlined words and strangely capitalized letters (as if it were a 19th-century romantic novel).
		* The writing is breathless, a lament over the decline and fall of Arden Vul, the futility of his life, and his regrets at tasks left unaccomplished.
		* It contains nothing useful because it is, in fact, a simple code: the underlining indicates a space in the message (i.e., it should not be read), while the capitalized letters, if removed and unscrambled, reveal a message.
			* 4d8 under INT to detect the secret (secret tongue of the priests of Set): “To my successor: Seek the documents in the room opposite. They are revealed by invoking the Black Boar. Speak Thrice Five.“
	* The grey plasteel chest, a rudishva relic, has a clear panel on its front.
		* It opens by speaking the number 5 three times in a row (‘thrice five’) in Mithric or Rudishva.
		* 12x 10-lb bars of pure platinum (2,500 gp each) and extremely sensitive documents involving the imperial family.
			* Although over one thousand years old, they still possess volatile political value (at the GM’s wish: they might reveal that the imperial family is descended from bastards, or that they worship demons, or something like that).
				* reveals the nature of the Pact of Ennius, the raising for shapeshifting dragon children and positioning them in the high noble households as spies / assassins / saboteurs.
				* a pretty big betrayal of the imperial family to its vassals.  would be a big scandal even now.  lists a number of names, including Yasdoranicil / Isadora.


Childmonger buys a girl from a single mother (hubby died), the gold will let her other 3 children get apprenticeships.  She's a Savage Heart tenant.  When she tries to change some of the money, angry neighbors take her to court before Sir Ironblood (did she kill the child in some witches' rite to buy a demon's aid?  sell it into slavery?  where did this gold come from?)
* Astrid's chamberlain comes to her with this unusual case bought to the court.
* the child will be raised among the Sun-Scarred Knights
* she was paid in ancient gold solidi
* She remembers a tall man in black.  He said her child would be raised well, in service to a good cause, and that with this gold she could ensure her other children a prosperous future.


The rituals of Arden and Vul have been conducted on their bridges of wisdom and doubt.
* Astrid gained a glimpse of Arden, wearily leaning on her spear.
* As the power of her blood increased, she "redded-out" and heard Psalor-Ki muse "fascinating, I didn't think I had succeeded" (in rudishvan).  He felt the surge in their shared blood and realized she existed.
	* Astrid will recognize his voice when they meet.

Deino has been subdued.
* She has grudgingly agreed to stop charming and transforming / killing people, and been allowed to continue dwelling in the beastman complex.
* She's curious if there's an angle for profit, allying with this rising new power in the halls.
	* She'd be willing to answer questions of advice on magical matters.
* She's looking for a way out of her "bonds", but is old and patient enough, and the conditions are gentle enough, that she wouldn't cause trouble without seeing major gain.
* 
* The varumani ambassadors beheld the whole affair and have informed the Thegn.
* 
* Deino's transformed animals and charmed victims can be freed with dispel magic.



The Survivors of Stone sought a rumored Thothian shrine on the east side of Bald Hill, north of Newmarket.
* It was said to have maps and models of parts of the Halls, and they hoped to learn more about the location of the Forge of Zhorak.
* They found it occupied by false dwarves, doppelgangers, likely seeking similar information.  The doppelgangers are dead (and a few juniors of the Stone), but they damaged the lore before they could be dispatched.  Still, some insight was gained.
	* The Forge seems to be situated in the depths, in some proximity to the Tomb of Phocion the Builder (not a priest of Ptah, but a blessed and inspired craftsman and devotee of the god) and the Temple of Bastet, the other god whose priests chose to build deep.

Ask Alexandros
* What happened to Visby and Callista in the Forum?
	* Alexandros remembers their capture.  He was brought in when the Setites realized they were Drome, to try to decipher their notes and codes (no luck).
	* Visby was traded to Skreel lizardmen, presumably to become a meal.
		* He is currently languishing at SL5-34.
	* Gunnar requested that he get to keep Callista for a time.
		* He was a depraved sort, everyone made the obvious assumption.
		* Gunnar had a special lockup somewhere for his private guests; presumably she went there.
		* Alexandros doesn't know where this was, and Gunnar vanished during Astrid's assault on the Guild of Service.  His body wasn't found, but he and his personal staff never turned up again.
			* Presumed to have taken their wealth and legged it; the cult was really pissed and put out word for him to be captured.
			* Stephania had grown suspicious of him prior to that.
		* Callista is in (4-64: Hidden Prison)
			* The prisoners died of thirst when the doppelgangers left and the top Guild of Service leaders who might have known of the secret prison.

How long ago was the raid on the forum?
What exactly did the party see of the doppelgangers?


Sigiric's party discovered in SL1
* the party looted and collapsed the Fenn's rudishvan outpost where the Hybridization took place.

Did doppel-Gunnar take real-Gunnar, Callista, and/or the set deacon out of the prison for any purpose?  Maybe they aren't dead?
* he kept Gunnar to question in support of his disguise
* he took the deacon because he got too nosy into "Gunnar's" activities
* he took Callista because he wanted to see if the Drome operation might be worth investigating.
	* when he left the Setites, he left Gunnar (recognizable from Visby's notes, including a distinctive tattoo) and the deacon to die.  he took Callista for further questioning, now needing a new environment to embed in.
		* Callista left Drome symbols scratched into the wall of Gunnar's private prison.
			* "agent was here", "cover compromised", "false operative" (her attempt to signal Gunnar being a doppelganger)

Priddy moves to the arcanum geode near the Thoth Temple on Level 3
* How does this end up going for them?
	* It goes great!  He's eagerly studying, he survived exposure and its effects, he's mining and studying arcanum.


Gevorda freed from Kerbog Khan, returning home.  Real pissed at the Khan.


Pharastina, sister of Vagtro Westron is guest of the Savage Heart

Ludrig, true varumani ambassador to the Archon of Arden Vul is a guest of the Savage Heart

* where did Tomas the Set Acolytes eyeballs get sent by Pol's Treatise on Scrying
	* At 2-8 (Pyramid of Venerable Age)


To the Thegn's Court
* spoke with Ludrig before going down; spoke of the 4 clans, the confra of hunters and the sorcerers
* Gog hails Astrid when they appear in the cavern.
	* He confides in Astrid about his exile from the court.
* Astrid and co descend via the lifts to 7-1

### ==--- PRESENT DAY ---==


TODO
* Give J the creation mold recipes
* post 'On the Terrible Old Gods' text to J


* write up a "notables" list for the Varumani; figure out the faction dynamics


To the Thegn's Court

* Varboka heard Astrid's proclamation from the Bridge via comms bracelet
	* Has he spoken of it with Ashoka or others in the court?
		* No

* any doppels in the Troll Market?
* any "refugee" merchants from the Forum in the Troll Market?


* Sir Prudence was informed by Melok-Ri about Astrid's pronouncement (heard on comms).
	* When Sir P learns of Astrid's arrival (he has goblin runners in his pay), he approaches.
	* He's very concerned about the devestation a varumani - Khan war could cause.  He'll gladly help prevent it, giving intel on the court and advice.
		* He'll likely decide Astrid is important enough and honorable enough that he'll reveal some info about the Knights in return for an oath to keep it confidential.  Civilization prevails, the Knight's aims, etc.
			* Concerned about the destruction of Set
			* Concerned about a monoculture in the halls if Archontean rule returns.
			* But very pleased with her handling of the Beastmen, finding a way to preserve them while curbing Deino.
		* Advice:
			* Ashoka is indeed honorable.  He's interested in growing the varumani arcane capabilities.
			* Gevorda is overbearing, but has her fans.  Some may see it as sport to "put the toymaker in his place".  Ashoka is worried, he knows how powerful the khan really may be, but most varumani see him as a delightful tinkerer.
			* Varboka fears the waning of his people and going down as a mere steward of that decline with no glory to his name.  This has made him contemplate expansionism (the goblins, a war vs the Khan maybe, turning
				* The heqeti have been growing, the hunters say, but most regard them as an enemy to just raid.  A serious war with them would be both glorious but also big risk.  The kaliyani are even more hated, and that would be a shoe-in.
			* Varboka isn't dumb, he didn't want to war with the Setites unnecessarily, and won't with the Khan; it pulls against his desire for glory, to have truly done something for his people.  The varumani are slow to rebuild their numbers, and are loss avoidant, at least at large scales.



Where are Callista and "Gunnar" now?
* Wherever the doppels are currently using as a base in the Halls (goblins? arena?)
	* she and any other captives (maybe some Arena vendor / hanger-on types?) are stashed somewhere nearby.

What fate for Artax-Ris?
* Artax will mention or Akla-Chah will pass on that Artax and Psalor's work attempted to revive slain rudishva, but resulted in mindless but potentially tractable necrobionts.  Only those transformed before death retain their intelligence.
* rolling 1d6 periodically to see how his therapy progresses
	* phase 1: 1 (bad); Akla-Chah says he is deeply depressed (the death of the rudishva, his own folly and change, and the gulf of time that has forgotten the rudishva are all still too fresh for him).  He wishes, and she agrees, that he should return to his auto-doc (wherever they think it best to stash it).  It allows him to enter a slumber-like state that is more soothing that he can achieve normally with his undead state.  She hopes he will process her words and his emotions in that time and when he emerges in some weeks or months, he might be more receptive.

Spy-balls watching...
* AV-19 basement
	* They'll see a Priscian team coming down, handling more supplies via floating disc.  They will note the slain zombies, examine the area and the supplies, and continue on (no sound, just vision).
	* They have blue-and-orange sortian knot insignia and are wearing unusual looking orange-tinted mail.  the fighter and thief but also the obvious mage are armed with gladii
* the Priscus statue in 4-164
	* Priscian mage comes and drops flowers periodically, prays and meditates; she's unsure about Nerub's leadership.  Her conversi wait in the hall, nerviously keeping an eye out for monsters.
		* ??? pick a named mage from the faction


* write up a "notables" list for the Priscians; figure out the faction dynamics


Who heard Astrid's address from the bridge?
* RAJ's feeds to all the main rudishva areas of the Halls as a good stand-in:
	* 5-84 to 5-98, 5-105 to 5-138, 6-4, 6-113 to 6-124, 6-103, 7-4 to 7-7, 7-35 to 7-41, 7-109 to 7-110, 8-51 to 8-53, 9-89 to 9-97, SL2-2 to SL2-3, SL9-44 to SL9-49, SL13-36 to SL13-39, and SL14-10 to SL14-14.

* med pod (and thither Kerbog Khan)
* LOAV hanger
* Upper and lower Bridge
* RAJ-750 and weapons pod
* The cloister
* level 5 transit shaft, creation molds, transit hub
* level 6 great pillar
* the midnight road
* varuda areas, bio-vats, varumani training area, ruined kaliyani area
* kaliyani pits rudishva complex (SL-9-44 to 49)
	* do the kaliyani hear at all?  check SL9-43, 41
* cryo pod area in SL-2
* level 6 & 7 floating gardens
* level 6 habitation pod
* level 7 engine room
* ??? 7-35 to 7-41
* ??? 7-108 to 7-110
* ??? 8-51 to 8-53
* ??? 9-89 to 9-97  bottom of transit shaft
* 
* Crelik-Var wrist-comm?
	* his goblin servant overheard, maybe also Tredgris was with him too?
* security constructs via comms
* kaliyani and rudiga comm devices
	* rudiga will plot against them
	* make him a cooler villain, since they've accepted Druva's geas to slay him
* Melok-Ri via comms
* Thegan Whitemane via Isoc-Crix's comms
	* maybe some other staff or patrons hear muffled words while at the Inn?
* Psalor-Ki via comms
* Reiv-Tor via comms
* Varboka heard Astrid's proclamation from the Bridge via comms bracelet(s)
	* Has he spoken of it with Ashoka or others in the court?
* Cinna Minux via comms


Doppelgangers begin trying to infiltrate the Drome in Gosterwick to get at the dwarves, and maybe steal any Ptah relics parties have (including the Savage Heart, maybe some minor magic items)
* frame the dwarves with the Drome / Alexia?  try to get them driven out of town.
* Kidnap dwarves to gain live lifestones, so they can lure the rest of the dwarves to doom
* etc

Doppels also want a new base within the Halls, having lost the Forum.
* Inn of the Lost?
	* ideal, but the antimagic aura messes with their shifting and mind-reading (can hold shape, but can't change)
* Troll Thegns Court?
* Arena? (maybe the best option)
* Priscians?
* Goblin Market? (easiest)

Is Alexia created Lady Burdock?  Did some other governor get appointed?
* If appointed, how does she start off doing?









## Future

Deino might be eyeing ways to get her poison or transformation brews into the party's drinks in some deniable place (Inn of the Lost, although it's antimagic would probably block that) or the like.

The Broom is seeking the sceptre of the goblins so the heqeti can enslave the goblins, as well as looking for info about the Priscians and ways to weaken the Varumani and Sun-Scarred Knights

The Kaliyani may move to make a forward post in the Forum of Set
* Taking over the secret areas?  Sealing off more of the priestly quarter.
* They try to keep their presence secret.

Astrid threw Khalid's body off the ledge into the chasm.
* Where does he land?  Somewhere on level 9?

Forum "refugees"
* birgir and asbjorn do excellently (inn of the lost?  troll market?)
* skellan skindros does excellently (inn of the lost?  troll market?)
* Gislu will also relocate to the inn of the lost
* 
* the various vendors might seek to grow a new market between the inn and the arena, but they'll need a powerful patron.
* the goblins want to make their halls the new upper market
	* Weskenim might pitch the party on it, and/or it may exacerbate his need for the "sceptre of the goblin king".  the Sun-Scarred Knights might encourage the Savage Heart to help?

rumor of Sir Nixion the Bold, Azure Knight
* mention his party disappeared.  Were searching the deep halls for archon's regalia
	* other members of the party are Cyra Red-Eyes (thief) and Testareon (mage)
* he'd be known to Astrid (LN)

## Far Future

Some of the Priscians will rethink their position and hew closer to the actual Sortian ideology if they learn of it.

The Forge of Zhorak should reveal the origin and nature of the doppelgangers.
* Revamp the business with Lozor Hornfels.  Lozor was Zhorak's chief apprentice, and was replaced by a doppelganger, who trapped and killed Zhorak.
* Among Zhorak's workshop papers:
	* Posters and screeds denouncing the Sortians and exhorting his apprentice-priests not to heed their blandishments the way some in other priesthoods have.
	* Fragmentary notes hinting at a complex project involving pa'ut (the creation of the doppelgangers as spies)
* In his chamber, he has written a confesion and last testament, describing his "profaning of the maker's blood" and his folly.  In secret, he sought to craft shapeshifting spies from pa'ut to root out the Sortians.  But without combining Ptah's craft with the wisdom of Thoth and the true life-giving power of Isis, unlike the homunculi (goblins), he realizes too late that the creations are soulless abominations.  They feed upon the power of the Maker (Ptah), ruining his works and devouring his priests to breed more of themselves.
	* Now he is trapped by the one who stole the form of his apprentice, and they are loose in the world.  It is fitting he perish as punishment for his folly.  Ma'at will not welcome me.

Heqeti powering up to overcome the lack of the Horn
* having the horn could help them; a weapon vs Kauket?
* initial summoning could mean Kauket is bound at the ziggurat, not yet free to roam


## Ongoing

The varuda have been moved to a compound outside gosterwick
* 

Kerbog Khan has entrusted Cheren to the Savage Heart's care
* they are trying to help her grow (find fiat power)
* Tresti wonders if data crystals could help create the mental capacity for her to grow more

Icthelon the good mummy is tending to the cleansed Temple of Thoth on level 5.
* he offers healing and respite for the virtuous (or those who tithe decently)



## Rumors Given

### To Volun

Bad Neighbors - Cyricus the thief (archontean fighter, slums, handsome, dirty fighting) to Gyrde the mage (female wiskin, interested in demons)
* There is an order of powerful knights within the Halls of Arden-Vul.  They are undead and fear the light.  If you see one in his black armor, run...and quickly!

Discipline and Punish - Fredegar thorcin cleric, venal liar, telling fibs to hinder competition while appearing a benevolent holy man
* You should avoid the Shining Well that leads into Arden Vul. Unholy lights strobe up its length, causing permanent blindness in all and madness in a few. Even if you make it to the bottom, the howling ghouls are sure to make short work of you in the demonic light.

Elf Background
* Gerrilad Lok and Sigeric Lok and a handful of others came here several dacdes ago, vanished.
* Noredden Galesdottir (leader of Primal Vengeance) came here seeking the prior expedition.

Theo gets an arcane rumor from the Arcane Practitioners Lodge
* From a historical text in the library of the Lodge: "The Sortians are usually thought to have been unanimous in their goals and tactics. In fact, they were as diverse as their opponents, the Theosophs. Priscus Pulcher of Arden Vul, often seen as a radical firebrand, actually advocated negotiation and compromise. He was opposed by other Sortian leaders who believed in violent rebellion.

Young acolyte, trying to impress with knowledge of Arden Vul lore
Deep in the Nether Reaches, on the eighth level, there is a grotto filled with giant carved heads that sing!  If you can get them to sing the right tune, they will reveal a treasure vault. But if they sing the wrong song, everyone dies!

Bad Neighbors discussing their goal of reaching the Obsidian Gates
The Hall of Forty Pillars is right next to the Obsidian Gates, and is filled with creepy albino toads. If the wrong person touches the Gates, the toads turn into demons and attack.

## Notes on Books


### The Betrayal

* A short, hastily scribed, and slightly bitter account of the treason of a certain Lisstak, chief of the kaliyani, against the rudishva.
	* The account claims that, after ‘our victory,’ Lisstak grew bored with peace. Lisstak began to use honeyed words to twist the minds of the kaliyani, causing them to envy the varumani and the varuda. Lisstak’s counsel grew contentious, and it angered Leil-Jor, who commanded obedience. Lisstak refused and departed, with the majority of the kaliyani. Lisstak sought out the remnant of the ‘old enemy’, and traded secrets of the masters for protection. Finally, the scroll alleges that it was through Lisstak that the ‘sickness’ arrived.
	* A anonymous; L Rudishva; T scroll; D 1x10x1; W .5 lb; M rudishva linen ‘paper’, XP:  0, GP: 500
* Author 'Ejan-Seph', operations department
* After 'our victory', the kaliyani (endonym 'Children of Yig') and rudishva continued research on the KDGS (kaliyani genetic degenerative syndrome).
* Despite the early success with the 'kaliyani refreshing liquid', progress ground to a halt, even though work continued.  If the medical pod had not be lost in the crash, perhaps more could have been achieved.  Or perhaps there is truth to Psalor-Ki's disregarded hypothesis of a thaumogenic basis to the syndrome.
* Lisstak, leader of the allied kaliyani consortium, made veiled insinuations that the rudishva were dragging feet.
* The author believes that the matter may have reached a tipping point when a breakthrough on 'the fuel problem' was made.  It is easy to forget after such long coexistence, that the kaliyani can be a suspicious and ruthless people.  The author believes if the kaliyani's need and the rudishva's biotechnical skill had not been such a perfect fit, the kaliyani might have been foes just as implacable as the heqeti.
* During the original conflict, the heqeti had been unable to produce bioweapons targeting rudishva and varuda physiology.  The author believes Lisstak provided biological knowledge, likely gleaned from working with rudishva biotech during the search for their cure, to the heqeti, allowing them to create new bioweapons.
* The author is penning this for the historical record.  They have chosen to remain in Arden Vul, rather than undergo 'hybridization', even if it means they will soon perish to the 'sickness'.  "Better to die a rudishva, than to surrender everything we were."  Though he does not fault those opting for Psalor-Ki's gambit.

### The Time of Darkened Skies

* This scroll provides a lengthy description of the efforts of the rudishva to drive back and destroy what they refer to as ‘the Hopping Ones’ (i.e., the heqeti). Among the useful nuggets are these: 
* The ‘hopping ones’ were vulnerable to fire and ‘blasting’. 
* The rudishva troops were organized in three units, varuda flyers, varumani heavy infantry, and kaliyani ‘power-wielders’. 

The events of the war include the seizure of the Obsidian Gates and Hall of Pillars (5-6); the razing of the hoppers’ Upper Temple (7-78 and 7-131); the slaughter of the hoppers in the Chasm; the defeat of the varuda at the Cave of Tears (8-67); and the final, successful, assault on the ziggurat of Kauket (areas 10-32 to 10-35) with attendant massacre of the hoppers.

Rudishva generals include ‘our lord’, Leil-Jor; the ‘prince of the delvers’, Grev-Kilj; the doomed and incompetent ‘star-reader’, Reav-Tak; the ‘mighty fist’, Vanara; the ‘brute-leader’, Druva; ‘far-soaring’ Raalk; and ‘the whisperer’, Lisstak.

* The original data crystal recording these events was degrading, so this transcription was made.  It is a screenplay-like write up of the original documentary by Crellik-Var.
* Notable Figures
	* 'wise and steadfast' Captain Leil-Jor
	* ‘champion of the delvers’, Surveyor Grev-Kilj
	* the doomed and incompetent ‘star-reader’, Navigator Reav-Tak
	* the ‘mighty fist’, Thegn Vanara
	* the ‘brute-leader’, Jarl Druva
	* the 'cunning-hunter', Jarl Rudiga
	* ‘far-soaring’ Advance Scout Raalk
	* ‘the whisperer’, Magister Lisstak
	* 'the elite shadows', led by Security Officers Melok-Ri and Isok-Crix
* Heqeti Intel
	* totalitarian theocracy worshipping a god of slime and endless consumption, Tsathoggua.  Akla-Chah's analysis is that they are psychologically incapable of more than brief, transactional or exploitative coexistence with other sentient species.
	* subterranean culture existing within the extensive sub-surface network of caverns on this planet "Underearth".  Halls of Arden Vul is a religio-cultural and "power-engineer" center, tapping the arcanum and warp-rifts.
	* primitive seeming stone technology, but backed by "magic" and extensive thaumaturgic bio-engineering of slimes, supposedly extruded from their god, for everything from weapons to construction.  extensive use of bioweapons, fungi, etc.
	* different castes of heqeti, the most common being the 'hoppers'
	* paralytic skin slime
	* dislike bright light
	* vulnerability to thermal attacks
* Major Events
	* initial clash against the hoppers as as the crash survivors begin exploring their new surroundings, trying to locate the scattered fragments of the Beacon.
		* hard-pressed by the heqeti offensive
	* first contact with the kaliyani, another subterranean species, whose scouts were captured while spying on crew activities.
		* Their wounds were treated and they were released as a show of good will.  To our surprise, their leaders made contact, offering an alliance against the heqeti.  Hard pressed and eager for allies with local knowledge, we agreed.  the rudishva marvel at kaliyani sorcery.
	* the kaliyani introduce the crew to another species 'humans', living on the surface.  primitive but vigorous and adaptable.
		* They are also victims of heqeti predations, used for food, slaves, and sacrifices.
		* They lack a cultural basis for understanding us except as deities, but are eager to accept our offer of weapons, training, and augmentation in return for fighting along side us against our mutual enemy.
		* creation of the varumani
	* seizure of the Obsidian Gates and Hall of Pillars (5-6)
	* the razing of the hoppers’ Upper Temple (7-78 and 7-131)
	* the defeat of the varuda at the Cave of Tears (8-67)
	* desperate acceleration of varumani augmentation through use of arcanum and the cloning pits to bolster forces against counterattack
	* extensive scouting and intel gathering allows RAJ-750's tactical analysis that enables a massive slaughter of the hoppers in the Chasm
	* the final, successful, assault on the ziggurat of Kauket (areas 10-32 to 10-35) with attendant massacre of the hoppers.
		* although they escaped with a number of powerful artifacts from the ruin of their ziggurat, we captured one of the four used to manifest the deadly heqeti "nooform-avatar".  According to Lisstak, without it, summoning will may be impossible, or at least vastly more difficult.

### The Properties of Arcanum

* This treatise enumerates eight ways in which arcanum (see new magic items) can be used to create, recharge, and modify various items.
	* It makes frequent reference to the ‘Creation Molds’ (5-89) and includes several of the ‘recipes’ to operate the molds.

* "Title page" mentions that this scroll is a compilation of various separate sources about arcanum on data crystals to allow those scarcer resources to be wiped and reused.
* Covers most of the Arcanum uses in the rules.
* Discusses the perils of arcanum deposits to casters (info relayed by the kaliyani)
* Incomprehensible discussion of its scientific properties, exposure to various kinds of chemical, radiation, fields, scanning, etc.
* Some theoretical discussion with Spiv-Kol on whether it could be harnessed for power generation.
