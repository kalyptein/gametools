Adventure Hooks

The Abducted Canon
 Lillian, canon of the temple of Mitra in Newmarket, has gone 
missing. The high priest wants her back and is offering a reward 
(5,000 gp) to those who can accomplish the deed.
 Source of the Hook: The priests of Mitra in either Newmarket 
or Gosterwick will offer the reward. As Lillian was popular, her 
absence is also generally known in these communities.
 Explanation: Lillian was investigating reports of beastman 
activity in the farmlands south of the cliff of Arden Vul when 
she went missing. She was abducted by the Green Fang kobolds 
living in the Thicket (see Burdock’s Valley), albeit at the orders of 
a beastman patrol led by Trisko the Natty (3-154). The beastmen 
took her back to Arden Vul, where they sold her to the cult of Set. 
She is currently languishing in the dungeons of Set (3-104).

Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: Following the leads of this 
mystery should lead PCs to the Thicket, where they can either fight 
or negotiate, and thence to Arden Vul. The kobolds know that the 
beastmen have an entrance on the cliff face (see EX-11 or 3-189), 
but generally steer adventurers to the pyramid (AV-15). PCs can 
explore Level 3, perhaps negotiating with the goblins (see 3-7) for 
information about, and/or assistance against, the beastmen (3-
123A to 3-162). Once the beastmen are located, PCs can either 
lead an assault against them, hoping to rid the region of Deino (3-
158), or can again negotiate. The trail eventually leads to the forum 
of Set (4-2). The Set cult is unlikely to reveal the identity of their 
prisoners, so stealth and investigation will be in order, unless the 
PCs are powerful (or stupid enough) to take the cult on headfirst. 
It might also be possible for a determined group with good intel 
to make a quick strike into the heart of the Set cult through the 
ruined temple of Thoth (3-71); such a group could push from 3-71 
to 3-89 and from there dip into the prisons of Set (3-105).



The Missing Regalia
 Lady Alexia Basileon (AK-2) is desperate to recover the 
four pieces of regalia that defined the office of archon during the 
glory days of Archontean control of Arden Vul. She knows that 
possession of the items will allow her to wrest lordship over the 
valley away from her half-brother, Iskander (currently Lord 
Burdock). Variant: Lord Burdock is aware of Alexia’s plans, and 
hires PCs to recover the regalia ahead of Alexia’s teams. Rewards 
include all treasure found within Arden Vul (except the regalia), a 
finder’s fee of 20,00 gp per item, and significant political influence.
 Source of the Hook: Lady Alexia Basileon (AK-2) herself 
provides the hook (or, conversely, her half-brother Iskander, who 
resides in Castle Burdock). Lady Alexia only approaches those 
who have already made a name for themselves.
 Explanation: The four pieces of regalia are among the most 
potent items to be found within Arden Vul. Indeed, PCs might well 
wrestle with the decision to surrender them to their patron. The 
four pieces are the iron circlet of Ghanor (3-127A), the bone 
ring of Jagri-Naz (5-74), the ebon spear (SL5-13B), and the 
tablet of the Beacon (9-107). 
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: PCs who take up this quest 
are in for a long and extremely difficult set of adventures that may 
well constitute a complete campaign. Certainly, the pursuit of the 
regalia will involve significant political maneuvering in Narsileon, 
Newmarket and other seats of Archontean power; consultation 
with sages or serious research in the libraries of the collegia will 
also be necessary (activity which may require side adventures). 
Within Arden Vul, the four items are currently found in widely 
divergent and extremely dangerous locations. The iron circlet of 
Ghanor is actually located close to the surface, but is defended 
by a powerful greater mummy; the bone ring of Jagri-Naz 
is possessed by the crazed and extremely dangerous rudishva 
survivor, Psalor-Ki; the ebon spear is guarded underwater by 
a lich served by several daemons; and the tablet of the Beacon is 
not only found at the foot of the Great Chasm, it is defended by a 
deadly vengeance aspect of Sekhmet. The acquisition of each item 
is thus likely to involve a protracted search and highly dangerous 
combat with potent adversaries.
 PC Levels: 8-15


Penetrate the Obsidian Gates
 The PCs hear of the Obsidian Gates and the stories of vast 
wealth concealed behind them. The challenge, of course, is how to 
open them ...
 Source of the Hook: It is relatively easy for PCs to hear about 
the Gates from discussion with other adventurers, or even from 
the various factions within Arden Vul (e.g., Goblins, Beastmen).
 Explanation: Unlike other hooks, there is no external reward 
for following this lead; PCs should be motivated by the lure of 
unplundered wealth. The Obsidian Gates were built by the heqeti 
and then improved (and warded) by the rudishva; the Archonteans, 
despite their long domination of Arden Vul, never penetrated 
them (at least not officially). The task of the PCs is to first locate 
the Gates and then figure out a way to open them.
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: The Gates are not difficult 
to locate, as those who descend the pyramid (AV-15 to 3-1) can 
quickly end up in Gog’s cave (5-2) by locating a concealed door 
(3-12). From Gog’s cave, the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6) is obvious, 
as will be the Gates themselves (5-6D). Opening them is another 
story. Experimentation may lead to disaster. It is necessary for 
PCs to realize that specialized keys are necessary to open the 
Gates; a list with the locations of all known keys is found in the 
Arden Vul items appendix. PCs may stumble across one or more 
keys by chance, or may (if the GM wishes) be given leads to their 
location by NPCs exterior to the Halls (e.g., a sage) or by members 
of one of the Arden Vul factions. In most cases, recovery of a set 
of keys requires a side-adventure. Once the Gates are penetrated, 
moreover, the PCs must deal with the substantial dangers along 
the Midnight Road.
 PC Levels: 4-7 


Infiltrate or Eliminate the Cult of Set
 All citizens of the Archontean empire know that the ancient 
cult of Set (one of the Twelve) was proscribed centuries ago. PCs 
will hear that the cult Set has been revived, and that its main cult 
center is reputed to lie within Arden Vul. Low-level PCs are tasked 
with infiltrating the cult and securing evidence about its numbers 
and practices; higher-level PCs may also be asked to eliminate 
the cult once and for all. Rewards for such actions can vary from 
the monetary (cash reward), to the forgiveness of crimes, or to 
admission into one of the Five Families via adoption.
 Source of the Hook: Theariable. One possible source is Keko 
the Lame, logothete of the Drome in Narsileon. Keko is not afraid 
to use the weight of his position to ‘encourage’ PCs to look into the 
cult. Good-aligned PCs might hear about the cult and choose to 
take action on their own; they might also be approached by good-
aligned temples (e.g., Mitra) or political groups (e.g., the Dawn 
Striders, see World of Archontos appendix). 
 Explanation: Set has indeed returned, or, to be precise, 
worship of the Red God of the Desert has been revived (since Set 
himself never disappeared). Cultists recolonized Level 4 of Arden 
Vul about ninety years ago, and their power (and numbers) have 
grown ever since. The current High Priestess, Stephania (4-51), has 
made the Forum of Set into a vibrant market for goods, slaves, and 
information, and has begun to attract cultist-pilgrims from outside 
Arden Vul.
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: The cult operates primarily on 
levels 3 and 4 of Arden Vul. It is relatively easy to glean information 
about the cult’s location from sources within Burdock’s Valley, 
since a slow, secretive, but steady stream of pilgrims and merchants 
have made their way up the valley to the cliff entrance (EX-15). 
PCs could scale the cliff to EX-15, or could signal for the basket 
to be lowered to them (especially if they are masquerading as 
merchants). The route to the Forum (4-2) from the cliff face is 
dangerous, but fairly well marked. Conversely, PCs could enter the 
Halls through the pyramid (AV-15) and make their way through 
Level 3 to the Set areas (e.g., 3-89). At the Forum, PCs are able 
to interact with cult members and other visitors from within 
and without Arden Vul. The nature of such interaction will vary 
according to the PCs’ alignment, relative experience, and interests. 
Some may wish to observe, count cultists, and investigate the 
extent of the cult’s activities; others may offer to serve the cult in 
order to win its friendship and learn its secrets; other bold (and 
powerful) parties may try to eliminate the cult by force.
 PC Levels: 4-8

Locate and/or Apprehend Kerbog Khan
 Locate the rogue archmage, Cerbactos Kalthetos, as well as the 
six rare codices that Cerbactos stole from the Imperial Academy’s 
library. Hard evidence of his location within Arden Vul (including 
a map from exterior to his sanctum) will produce a reward of 
5,000 gp; return of each of the six codices will bring a reward equal 
to 1.5x their value; apprehending the Khan and bringing him to 
justice brings a reward of 25,000 gp and a choice of magic items; 
producing evidence of his death brings a reward of 5,000 gp.
 Source of the Hook: A representative from the Imperial 
Academy, one of the seven collegia, offers this job.
 Explanation: The representative reveals that Cerbactos 
entered Arden Vul some 50 years ago and is currently calling 
himself Kerbog Khan. The six codices stolen from the Imperial 
Academy are Blood is the Key to All, by the Sanguinator, Principles 
of Magical Attraction, by Herluinus, Animating the Inanimate, by 
Vaslotus Light-Fingers, Locomotion in Animals and Humanoids, by 
Spindledor, A Hierarchy of Essential Fluids, by Licinia the Vampire, 
and Successful Reanimation, by Herbertus Occidentalis (see Arden 
Vul books for all). Kerbog Khan is ensconced in a well-defended 
lair on Sub-Level 12, where he has been investigating the junctions 
of biological and mechanical life (see SL12-25).
 Relevant Area of Arden Vul: PCs may already have en-
countered Kerbog Khan through one or more of his automatons. If 
not, a likely location in which to do so is the Great Cavern of Level 
3 (3-163, 3-172), or the Forum of Set (4-2), or at any number of 
random areas throughout the upper levels. PCs adept at negotiating 
might be able to persuade the Khan (through his automatons) to 
give them directions to his sanctum (provided they can persuade 
the Khan that they have items to trade to him) or even to teleport 
them there. Locating Kerbog Khan’s lair without such advice is 
much more difficult, since all entrances are well hidden. Once PCs 
have located the Sanctum, they must negotiate with the Khan or, if 
they are very powerful, attempt to overwhelm his defenses.

Stop the Poison Supply
 A deadly new poison with the street name of “Mortality” 
has been cropping up in the communities of the empire. Can the 
PCs locate the source of the poison and put a stop to it? Relevant 
authorities in Newmarket and/or Gosterwick will pay up to 2,000 
gp/PC for proof that the supply has been permanently stopped.

Source of the Hook: Mayor Josselin Rinstock of Newmarket 
(see Burdock’s Valley), or the thesmothete Eusbia Phokas (AK-23) 
of Gosterwick (or their agents).
 Explanation: The poison is being brewed by Phlebotomas 
Plumthorn and his band of evil halfling thugs. Mortality is based 
on spider venom, of which Phlebotomas has two sources. The first 
is a secret ‘spider farm’ located within the New Forest; his men 
‘milk’ the spiders there and bring the venom to Phlebotomas in 
Arden Vul [Note: GMs may wish to modify the fine module, The 
Spider Farm, by Stuart Marshall, as the location for this farm; it can 
be downloaded for free at Dragonsfoot.org]. The second source of 
venom is limited trade with denizens of Arden Vul.
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: Phlebotomas’s operation is 
located on Level 3, just where the stairs from the pyramid (AV-
15) enter the dungeon levels. Some PCs might be able to track 
Phlebotomas’s suppliers from either Newmarket or Gosterwick 
back to Arden Vul, and thus learn where Phlebotomas’s operation 
is based. Others may be able to uncover the source of the spider 
venom in the New Forest (see Burdock’s Valley), from which they 
will be directed to Arden Vul. Engaging with Phlebotomas might 
then entangle the PCs with other adventure seeds.
 PC Levels: 1-3


Find the Rogue Druid
 A druid from the circle of the Old Forest has disappeared 
into Arden Vul. Disturbing reports suggest that this druid, named 
Gerrilad the Grey, has ceased to concern himself with preserving 
the Balance. PCs are asked or hired to investigate and bring him to 
the circle for judgment.
 Source of the Hook: A druid PC can be approached by a 
member of the Circle of the Old Forest. Otherwise, PCs known to 
have delved into Arden Vul could be approached by Fael Valdorsdot 
in Gosterwick (AK-18). The source reveals that Gerrilad has not 
attended the Circle in more than two years; when last he was 
encountered, he was ranting incoherently about ‘baboon society’.
 Explanation: Gerrilad the Grey (2-69) has indeed lost his way 
and has decided that animals (and especially baboons) represent a 
purer natural force than humans. He has set himself up as leader 
of the albino baboons on Level 2 of Arden Vul (see 2-35), where he 
erratically dispenses justice.
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: Gerrilad rules most of Level 
2. There he is supported by the giant intelligent baboons and a 
rogue magic user; the ordinary albino baboons roam the darkened 
halls in packs. Some bold parties might be able to access Level 
2 directly by descending the Well of Light (AV-14, 2-1). Others 
might cleverly decide to follow the baboons that sometimes hunt 
in the ruined city and/or the long stair (EX-8) back to their lair. 
Doing so could lead the PCs to several entrance points, all of which 
lead eventually to Level 2 (e.g., EX-12 via Sub-Level 3; and AV-
10). The most traditional route to Level 2, however, is to enter the 
pyramid (AV-15) and then work upwards from Level 3; this could 
be accomplished via the stairs at 3-21 or by manipulating the lesser 
pyramid at 3-11. Extremely clever or lucky PCs might discover 
Gerrilad’s backdoor route from the exterior to Level 2 (AV-46), 
although they would need to navigate all of Sub-Level 15 to do 
so. Once they have arrived on Level 2, PCs will need to locate and 
defeat Gerrilad, probably after an epic battle in 2-35.
 PC Levels: 3-5


Cleanse the Ziggurat
 A great, demonic evil has been growing within Arden Vul; 
if unchecked it threatens all of Burdock’s Valley and potentially 
the continent of Irthuin. This evil has been linked to the horrific 
ziggurat that is said to lie at the bottom of the dungeon. Can the 
PCs locate the ziggurat and defeat the growing evil? Defeating the 
evil should stand as its own reward. 
 Source of the Hook: PCs might learn of this problem through 
their own exploration of Arden Vul. Conversely, an outside, 
good-aligned source might approach powerful PCs, present some 
historical and/or theological evidence of the threat, and invite 
PCs to tackle the problem: such sources might include the Dawn 
Striders, the exarch in Narsileon, or a high-level priest from one of 
the good-aligned temples in Narsileon.
 Explanation: The evil in question is the demon prince Kauket, 
whom the heqeti builders are attempting to summon to this plane. 
Kauket is possibly linked to an even greater cosmic evil, the god of 
pitiless consumption, Rimmaq-Isfet. Located on the lowest level of 
Arden Vul, the ziggurat of Kauket has been restored by the heqeti as 
part of their long-term strategy to reoccupy all of Arden Vul. Hard 
information about its location is hard to come by, although sages 
and the more powerful intelligent denizens of Arden Vul know 
that it is accessed by a well-guarded tunnel leading from the foot 
of the Great Chasm. It should be clear that this hook will require 
many seasons of adventuring to complete, and may indeed serve as 
the overarching structure to an entire campaign within Arden Vul. 
Indeed, PCs are well advised to gather intelligence, experience, and 
items before tracking the evil to its source; they will need to learn 
about the heqeti and their abilities, and might find it valuable to 
suppress a series of lesser evils (the heqeti upper temple at 7-79, 
the presence of Rimmaq-Isfet in the Feasting Hall at 8-76, and the 
colossal statue of Kauket buried in the muck at 9-12, and so forth). 
Accomplishing some or all of these goals will directly weaken the 
heqeti on Level 10 and make the task of cleansing the ziggurat 
easier. The PCs must also guard against the overriding desire of 
the heqeti to recover the lost sounding horn that will allow them 
to summon Kauket itself; although the horn is safely locked in a 
rudishva vault (5-95A) at the moment, the heqeti are searching for 
it and PCs who locate it might find themselves the target of theft 
or worse. Those cocky souls who force their way directly to the 
ziggurat are likely to be overwhelmed.
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: In a simplistic sense, the task of 
defeating the heqeti and cleansing the ziggurat is limited to Level 
10. Access to that level is via a corridor on Level 9 (9-82). But, as 
noted above, wise PCs will wish to thoroughly explore other areas 
of Arden Vul in an effort to weaken the heqeti (and Kauket) before 
turning their attention to the ziggurat.
 PC Levels: 9-15

The Mystery of the Beacon
 Assiduous explorers of Arden Vul, and particularly those 
who penetrate beyond the Obsidian Gates, are likely to come 
across reference to the great ship of the rudishva, the Beacon. Just 
what was this Beacon? Where may it be found? Can it be made 
seaworthy again? Players may quickly realize that the Beacon is 
indeed a starship, and some may choose to have their PCs explore 
the potential of space flight!
 Source of the Hook: No outside authority or source of wisdom 
can impart this hook, as the identity of the Beacon is unknown to 
even the greatest sages. PCs must uncover enough clues about the 
mysterious nature of the Beacon through adventuring in Arden 
Vul and then decide to follow those clues to their logical end.
 Explanation: Since the Beacon broke into constituent modules 
upon its crash landing into the cliff of Arden Vul, it is impossible 
to restore the Beacon to its original form. Still, one of the Beacon’s 
shuttles did survive, and is technically space-worthy. Indeed, 
only days before the heqeti assault that destroyed the rudishva 
hegemony, the rudishva had finally solved the propulsion problems 
that had prevented them from using the shuttle for interstellar 
flight. PCs interested in the rudishva and/or in a different kind of 
adventure could thus follow the trail of clues that will allow them 
to prepare the shuttle for space flight. 

Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: The shuttle is found on Sub-
Level 13 (SL13-37A). Enough fuel for one interstellar jump is 
also located in the shuttle bay (SL13-37); it is possible to discover 
the formula that will allow intelligent PCs to produce more fuel, 
though (see 9-96). Yet PCs will also need to recover at least one 
drive rod from the engineering pod of the Beacon (7-143) and one 
or more astrogation crystals from the bridge of the Beacon (SL14-
10). All of these areas are difficult to locate and access (although 
either rudishva AI might be willing to assist - see SL14-13 and 
6-27). General knowledge of the rudishva and their long history 
is probably desirable before PCs attempt to activate the shuttle; 
PCs can learn the story of the rudishva on Level 5 (areas 5-86 to 
5-98, 5-105 to 5-138), in the few surviving modules of the Beacon 
and rudishva (e.g., 6-27, 6-113 to 6-123, 7-143, SL12-4 to SL12-15, 
SL14-10 to SL14-14), and in other rudishva areas (9-89 to 9-97, 
SL9-41 to SL9-49).
 PC Levels: variable, 6-9


Tracking the Eighth Collegium
 Since the dark days of the war between Sortians and Theosophs, 
the number of collegia devoted to magical scholarship and training 
has been fixed by imperial decree at seven. And yet, rumors of an 
eighth, hidden collegium have persisted for centuries. It is said that 
the eighth collegium - if it exists - must have access to rare spells, 
summoning information, and magical processes. Gossip had 
fingered the archmage Nerub Null as a potentially leading figure in 
this shadowy organization. When he disappeared some fifty years 
ago, it was thought that he had died or gone underground. Now a 
reputable report places Nerub Null in Arden Vul with a small team 
of supporters. The leaders of at least five of the mainstream collegia 
will offer substantial rewards in coin, spells, and magic items to 
those who can produce definitive proof of the existence, structure, 
and operations of the eighth collegium; the reward doubles if the 
archmage Nerub Null can be brought alive for interrogation in 
Narsileon or Archontos.
 Source of the Hook: A magic user PC has probably heard the 
rumors of an eighth collegium. The hook will be offered to such 
PCs (and their friends) by the leader(s) of the PC’s collegium.
Explanation: the eighth collegium is the Order of Priscians (see 
Factions of Arden Vul). It is true that Nerub Null has come to Arden 
Vul; he has established a base in an old Sortian outpost on Level 
9. From there, the Priscians hope to loot Arden Vul for its magical 
treasures and hidden knowledge. Carefully composed strike teams 
of Priscian war mages and conversi may be encountered elsewhere 
in Arden Vul.
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: The main Priscian outpost is 
on Level 9 (9-58 to 9-64A). They have a smaller presence on Level 
6 (6-48 to 6-49A). Lucky or clever PCs might be able to discover 
the Priscians’ secret route into Arden Vul (AV-19), which leads to 
6-49 and thence to Level 9. It might also be possible for PCs to 
ambush one of the Priscian exploration teams (7-143, 9-31, or SL4-
44) and in that way learn the location of the Priscian base.
 PC Levels: 9-12

The Tomb of the Twins
 Sometimes scholarly research pays off! A contact has provided 
you with sure-fire information concerning the long-lost tomb of 
the Twins, that is, the resting place of the famous twin warriors 
of antiquity, Thekla and Taticus. The tomb is said to contain the 

Gemini blades (see new magic items), which the twins used to 
defeat the troll of Helmdorf. Your contact will pay 15,000 gp for 
each of the Gemini blades, assuring you that there will be plenty 
of additional treasure in the tomb of the Twins and ‘nearby’ tombs. 
The contact informs you that the tomb is found along the south 
wall of the Drowned Canyon, next to the tomb of Phocius Tricotor; 
so if you can find Phocius’s tomb (easy!, says your contact), it’ll be 
a simple task to find the tomb of the Twins.
 Source of the Hook: The hook with its specific details can be 
provided by an outside source, such as Calpurnia the Quiet, one of 
the leaders of the Collegium of Macrina (see World of Archontos 
appendix). Alternatively, PCs may hear of the deeds of the twins 
(through one of the Arden Vul books, perhaps) and conduct their 
own research through sages and magic.
 Explanation: The PCs’ source is correct: the tomb of the Twins 
is located in the Drowned Canyon (SL6-88), and the Gemini 
blades can be recovered there. Accessing the Drowned Canyon 
can be difficult, however. Once PCs have entered the canyon, it will 
be necessary to use hit-and-miss tactics (or magic) to determine 
the precise location of the tomb of the Twins (SL6-88). 
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: The tomb of the Twins is found 
on Sub-Level 6. The contact’s information is useful, as the tomb 
of Phocius Tricotor (SL6-81) is one of the most obvious along the 
south wall, given that its entrance is visible above the waterline. 
Unfortunately, it is impossible to access the tomb of the Twins 
from that of Phocius Tricotor; PCs will need to poke about near 
Phocius’s tomb to discover one of the real entrances to the tomb of 
the Twins (i.e., SL6-80, some 50’ below the waterline, which leads 
to the false tombs of SL6-86 and SL6-87, or via the backdoor route 
leading from SL6-91, to SL6-96, and then to SL6-89). Accessing 
the Drowned Canyon poses its own problems, as Calpurnia has 
no idea how to do so (if she’s used as the source of information). 
PCs will need to discover the stairs at 3-87, or traverse the spillway 
from the chasm to 6-143, or locate one of the other entrances to 
the Drowned Canyon. All of these entrances are difficult to locate, 
and may require negotiation with other factions, consultation with 
sages, or other significant research.
 PC Levels: 6-8


Rescue Operation
 Someone has gone missing in Arden Vul, and it’s up to the 
PCs to locate and rescue him/her/it! Will doing so bring a reward, 
a new party member, or merely a sense of satisfaction?
 Source of the Hook: If a given prisoner is connected to an 
individual or institution that would pay for his/her/its release, that 
interested party is listed in the third column below. Otherwise, the 
GM should decide who the interested party might be. 
 Explanation: The following table includes a complete list of 
all prisoners/captives found within the Halls of Arden Vul, along 
with indications of where they are being held and who, if anyone, 
is interested in procuring their release. Some captives have built-in 
mini-quests associated with them. For example, Lillian the canon 
is the subject of her own hook (see above); the temple of Mitra will 
pay good money for her rescue. Similarly, High Priestess Stephania 
of the cult of Set would be interested in the return of Berenice, 
the Set deacon. For most prisoners, however, no interested party is 
given. Partly this is because these prisoners are NPC adventurers, 
unconnected to the factional politics of the Halls. Still, the GM 
could decide that the relatives or comrades of one of these NPCs 

has approached the the PCs and asked them to locate their missing 
family member/friend; such parties might provide a vague report of 
where the NPC was headed. So, for example, the GM might decide 
that Weothas, the now-lame former companion of Samantha the 
Red and Tresti Iredell, approaches the PCs and begs them to rescue 
his comrades. In such a case, Weothas could explain how his party 
had descended the Well of Light (2-1) to the ‘secret halls of the 
Thoth priests’ (Level 2), where they were beset by terrible, barking 

apes that overwhelmed their party. Last he saw, Samantha and 
Tresti were being dragged away by an enormous, four-armed ape! 
Such a hook provides PCs with a motive and general location for 
the captives found in 2-36B and 2-36C. Perhaps Samantha and/or 
Tresti are interested in joining forces with their rescuers?

The Oldest Profession? Or, Tomb Robbing 101
 Everybody knows that Arden Vul is filled with ancient tombs 
that are ripe for the looting! The PCs have come across a good 
lead to a particular tomb [selected from the table below]. It’s now 
a matter of locating that tomb and relieving its occupant of any 
remaining treasures.
 Source of the Hook: The source should vary at the GM’s dis-
cretion. One potential source might be an interested outsider, 
willing to pay to equip an expedition to plunder a specific tomb 
(for one example, see above, the Tomb of the Twins). Another 
source could be a sage or other scholarly source located in one of 

the imperial cities (Narsileon, Arcuturos, Archontos); this scholar 
might have a few scraps of information about the individual 
buried in the tomb and a greater or lesser sense of where the 
tomb is located. With a small amount of work, the GM could also 
drop hints about a specific tomb - even a treasure map - within 
Arden Vul, either as a scrap of lost text, as hearsay from fellow 
NPC adventurers, or as a specific lead from a member of one of 
the native factions. For instance, perhaps Killik, the goblin sub-
chief (5-46) and his men recently observed two ‘foolish outsiders’ 
climbing the chasm wall towards a strange circular piece of stone. 

Sadly, says Killik, ‘those fools never returned’. This hook refers to 
the tomb of Artax-Ris at 3-39.
 Explanation: The following table collects in one place all the 
lost tombs of Arden Vul. It should be noted that these are tombs, 
and not merely lairs (of which there are hundreds more). The 
table provides a location for the tomb, the name (if known) of 

the original occupant(s), the type of tomb guardians (if any), the 
extent to which the tomb complex is trapped or concealed, and 
some indication of the size and quality of its treasure. 
 Relevant Areas of Arden Vul: Varies. See locations on the
