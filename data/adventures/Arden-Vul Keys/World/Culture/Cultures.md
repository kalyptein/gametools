## Human

Archontos

* ancient archontos had plenty of blood sport.  the church of the flame frowns on it, but softer forms are still practiced (charioteering, non-lethal/non-slave fights), gladiators and charioteers can be celebrities, there are still underground pit-fights that are much more likely to end in blood, run by gangs and mobsters
- the Church of the Flame ended slavery, all beings endowed with souls are kin (humans, homunculi, trollkin, bes-herdu)
	- Technically elves and mi'it don't have mortal souls, but they're obviously sapient.  Other beings like lizardmen, kaliyani, etc are open questions, but still, the principle now stands on general philosophical and moral grounds.
- sorcery taught by the gods, chiefly Thoth, but also Set, Bast, etc.

Thorcinga
* Norse (more in the isles), germanic, anglo-saxon (or on the mainland)
* sorcery taught by Odin, Mimir, Loki, etc
* Wiskin isles are ethnically Thorcin too, just more sea-faring focused.
* Thegns rule clans.  Sometimes powerful thegns will unite / conquer a region, elevating to kings of kingdoms.
* In the east of Irithuin, in archontean lands, many were archonteanized, and carried forward with that cultural heritage even after withdrawal (and lots of Wiskin raids).
* Raiding and clan feuds and rivalries are an endless feature, the Reclaimers are the first stab at any kind of Thorcin nationalism

Wiskin?

Khumus
- sorcery taught by the Sky via astrology, the omens of bird flight, and the writhing of storms


Ramaali

* inhabitants of the Red Sand Desert (Al-Rimal Alhamra, in their language), thus the people are the Ramaali
* persian, turkish, north african
* in and around the lands of the Red Sand Desert
* most are theoretically part of a united Caliphate of the immortal flame, but it's much more a tangled Holy Roman Empire type of affair, with sultans, beys, nomadic tribes, and all sorts jumbled together, often warring or competing
* the faith of the immortal flame originated here and spread to archontos.
* back in the old archontean days, a Ramaali empire existed called Mamlaka, or the Mamlakuud Dynasty, rival to Archontos.  They worshipped Marduk and the other babylonian gods

Lokhossan

Nyalan

## Demi-human

Elves / Alfar
* tattooed with "meridian lines" and "chakras", lattices of lines, unique to each elf.  usually marked with blue woad, but color choice can vary.  this is part of harnessing the primal energies in their body that allow them to do magic.  they are disrupted by the use of metal.
	- these channels were originally bioengineered receptivity to their cybernetics
	- the heqeti unleashed a plague along with their slimes to kill the rudishva / elves.  Modern elves are descended from rudishva who fled arden vul, and they bonded with the planet's primal energies and hybridized with humans to save themselves from the plague, which afflicted them even outside AV itself.
	- the change and further interbreeding with humans (whose genetics had been imbibed in the change) have led to the unusual but more human-looking elves, vs the original rudishva (shorter, smaller horns, more human facial features, etc)
	- this kind of magic interferes with their practice of sorcery (as did cybernetics?)  since most elves are tattooed from an early age, there are very very few mages among them
- human height, short horns, opalescent irises, gracile, Thorcin pale skin
- names tend to be of the local human culure with a hyphen and a single syllable "surname", a marker left from their rudishva past, e.g. Lothar-Ki or Anaxamander-Nur

Homunculi / Nebilung / Goblins
* created by ancient Archontean alchemy and sorcery from pshut fluid and human tissue, gradually developed / perfected
* gnarled, pallid little goblin/gnome people; their pallor makes them avoid the sun or cover up.  They prefer the shade of forests, cloudy skies, caves, etc.
* infravision
* nimble, keen-eyed and eared
* originally slaves, but freed when the Church of the Flame pushed through abolition and recognized them as having mortal souls.
* they were brought everywhere the archonteans went, and "feral" populations have gone their own ways, often harboring a dislike of humans.  Imperial homunculi are proud of their civilized nature and integration into the empire.
* sexless, genderless (though they may pick an expression if they please), breed by alchemic means (mounding up organic matter and watering it with homunculus blood every day for a month--groups of homunculi may cooperate, collectively becoming parents--after which a child homunculus forms and burrows out after another month or two)
* Live slightly shorter lives than humans, but mature about twice as fast.

Trollkin
* varumani who left AV degenerated into trolls, dumb cannibalistic brutes, who dwell across Irithuin.  In time, some "degenerated" further back toward humanity, shedding more of their rudishva genemods.
	* There are small villages in Irithuin's wildlands entirely of trollkin, but sometimes a human couple will produce a surprise trollkin child due to latent genetics (due to some trollkin ancestry), this happens chiefly in Thorcinga, the genes not having spread far enough to crop up elsewhere (maybe rarely in Khumus?)
* They are ~7' tall, heavy featured and powerfully built.  Often though dull-witted, but not actually (at most, many are just from rustic, primitive backgrounds)* 
* Can heal anything that doesn't kill them except damage to the brain (even that might organically heal, but lost or altered memories, personality, etc don't).  Takes about a month to regrow a finger or soft tissue, a year to regrow a limb, and somewhere in between for organs, eyes, etc.
	* Healing does leave scars, but no loss of functionality

Hands of Ptah / Dactyloi / Dwarves
* during the theo-sort war, the cult of Ptah retreated into its forge-sanctums and sealed themselves (and their servants, and families) away.  This is generally assumed to be to survive the empire-toppling war, and while it is, it is also to escape the predations of their own creations, the doppelgangers.
	* their long centuries in their vaults have changed them; stockier, powerful build, stony skin-coloration, strange eyes (light-sensitive?)
	* they developed lifestones as a kind of biometric ID and a means of locating lost members
		* they appreciate the return of lost lifestones
		- can use the life-stones with special Locate Object to find the person at great range; also to scry on or communicate with them?
		- originally a mark of initiation into the cult
	* highly insular, seldom leave without very good reason (Arden-Vul is such a reason)
	* drenched in insularity, taciturn stoicism, and paranoia, not friendly to outsiders; odd customs, seldom drink or indulge
	* the cult language has become their primary language, which they don't tend to teach to others
	* they worship Ptah and no other.
	* the original Ptah cultists did not pass on the origin of the doppels, out of shame.  The doppels have mockingly told them in the past that they were "the Maker's Sin", and the name has remained, but the dwarves don't know why.  They assume it means "Maker's", meaning Ptah, but it is actually "Makers'", the cult.
* they shave their heads, men may or may not grow beards.  they mark themselves with geometric tattoos.  they like hammers as weapons, for their symbolism.  they tend to be temperate and serious.  they take stone-based surnames representing groups / cells / lineages?
- there are forge-holds here and there, a big one in Mithruin and another in Irithuin, both created during the old empire days

- they created the doppelgangers during the war of theosophs and sortians.  The doppelgangers seek to slay them, as their life-stones, blood, and other works hold the power of Ptah which sustains and empowers the doppels.
- they craft magical items; Zorak was one of them; they had a place in Arden-Vul.
- groups of cultists rushed here here to reclaim Zhorak's relics and lore, and other relics of Ptah, and there is a member or few in the Prosperity Factor.  Doppelgangers are here following them, trying to reach the forge first to suck it dry.

Bes-herdu / Halflings
* created by the ugly bearded dwarf-godling Bes, protector of children and mothers and fighter of demons
	* no one is quite sure how; theories include...
		* actual byblows of Bes with human women
		* as the god is said to have been gnarled by constant contact fighting evil spirits, perhaps Bes's priest / paladins suffered the same, or took it on as a sign of devotion, and it passed on?
		* descended from servitors sent among mortals by Bes
* boistrous, gluttinous, love rowdy music, sex, dance, smoking, gambling, etc.  courageous
* darker skinned, long-armed, wild hair, short and burly
* can consume any amount of intoxicants and remain upright and functional (but still profoundly fucked up)

Mi'it (me'it) / Grimalkin / Bastlings
* uplifted temple-cats of Bast
* child-sized, cat-headed and lightly furred, tailed
* small colonies still exist here and there, mostly in places associated with old temples of Bast


## Inhuman

Ophidian???
* worsahip Yig?

Lizardmen???
- playable?
- degenerate kaliyani / ophidians, bulkier, less intelligent, bigger, thicker scales

Heqeti
* worship Dagon? Kauket?  Rimmaq-Isfet?

Doppelgangers / Herawai "face robber" / Ashaher "many face"
* animate, self-willed blobs of paut fluid, but soulless (thus sociopathic)
* they are similar to the homunculi, but those were made by the combined efforts of the cults of Isis and Ptah.  The doppels were made in secret with only Ptah, and the result lacks soul.
* take forms, impersonate and insinuate
* created as spies during the Theosoph / Sortian war, still going, masterless
	* created by priests of Ptah (stand in for dwarves), and they seek to erase knowledge of themselves, or otherwise undo the works of Ptah and his creator-priest-mages, like Zorak.
	* they require the energies of Ptah to grow and reproduce, so hunt his cult

## The Ennian Calendar

* Dated from the signing of the Compact of Ennius (Ennii Pactum), considered the founding of the empire.
	* Dates are either SP (sine pacti, "without the pact" for prior years) or AEP (ab Ennii Pactum, "from the compact" for after)
	* Dates are also often given as the Nth year of the reign of a given Emperor / Empress (regnal dates).
	* Currently 2993 AEP, the 8th year of Constans XXV.
* Years on Magae are 372 days, which the Archonteans divide into twelve 30-day months, each a lunar cycle, with two 6-day intercalary periods in late summer (harvest festival) and late winter (winter solstice)
