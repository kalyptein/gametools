* The Senate handles a lot of routine law-making

* Its special agents are called the Black Lotus, and greatly feared.

* Citizens: 
* Plebians: 
* Foreigners: 

The Seven Collegia
* After the War of Sortians and Theosophs nearly destroyed the empire 1200 years ago, and the old cults faded with the rise of the Church of the Immortal Flame, the Seven Collegia were established, making magical learning more open and egalitarian.
* Magical training is still illegal in the empire outside the purview of the Collegia.
	* Those trained in magical traditions are grandfathered in, but expected to attach themselves to a Collegium; some just quietly teach apprentices out in the provinces, hoping to be overlooked.
* The Collegia
	* Order of Thoth: remnant of the cult; kept the name but is secular these days.  Old and still fairly prestigious, great old stores of magic items, knowledge, etc.  Generalist mages.
	* College of Cinders: elementalists
	* College of Perception: mages focused on illusion and divination
	* The Imperial Academy: a react against the hoi polloi getting in, a new high nobles-only club.  Generalist mages.  Very rich, very well connected, small.
	* Collegium Macrini: founded by students of Macrinus Furiosus (a violent Sortian notable) after the war.  Noted for its original research and new spells.
	* Nova Schola Auctoritatis (new school of rule/authority): generalists and necromancers, devotees of the "path of arcane might / authority" a philosophy of domination
	* Order of the Five Circles: summoner and scholars of the planes

The Factors
* Empire-wide merchantile enterprises, with factor-holds in every major settlement.
	* Members can travel between cities and have a secure base, allies, banking, and lines of credit to draw on.  These services can be provided to non-members as a profitable side-line.
	* Smaller, regional factors also exist.
* The Silent Factor
	* Members wear red silk robes that cover all but their eyes and any speak to outsiders using a sign language (known only to them) and interpreters.  Esteemed for its discretion and absolute neutrality.  They believe anonymity ensures egos, rivalries, and enmities don't spoil good business.
	* Some dealings with the Wiskin isles; intermediaries for the ransoming of plunder and hostages by Wiskin reavers.
* The Golden Band
	* Largest and wealthiest of the four big factors, steeped in tradition and pomp.
		* Some old traditions relating to Ra, Set, and Osiris.
	* Grew out of reorganizations and mergers that included of the Sodality of Plenty in the ancient empire, a proto-Factor organization.  The Golden Band's continuity and age account for much of its foremost standing.
	* They have a lot of agricultural holdings in the Grain Isles, and traffic in the best vintages and pipeweeds.  Golden grain is a common motif / symbol in the factor.
* The Prosperity Factor
	* Maintains some unusual connections with the forge-holds of the Hands of Geb and is the only source of dwarven goods to the outside world.  They are one of the few sources of knowledge about dwarves and their culture as well.  They do some performative worship of Ptah as part of their formalities.
		* Maybe the dwarves needed something badly enough they opened this pin-prick in their armor?  Do they give factor members life-stones?
	* It's Thorcin members have recently (last century or so) established ties to elven weald-holds as well, importing their goods and art, and exporting imperial goods to them.
* The Wisdom Factor
	* Originally a Ramaali trading concern; they operated in territory the ancient empire took in its recent re-expansion into the exarchate of Arcturos.  They brokered standing with the empire to continue accessing their holdings, and have become a bridge between empire and caliphate.  They are the main purveyors of goods from Khumus and Ostralios.
		* Might have some shady ties to the southern pirates and Sweetwater Hold?

Church of the Immortal Flame
* Ranks
	* Pontifex: spiritual advisor to the emperor and head of the Church.  Elected for life by the Assembly of Cardinals.
	* Cardinal: each is overseer of a theme, in charge of its bishops (comparable to an exarch, strategos, eparch, etc)
	* Bishop: overseers of various sizable population centers and regions (comparable to an archon)
	* Priest: staff the churches of the empire; various ranks from high priests to acolytes.
	* Abbot: head of a monastery or abbey.
	* Monk: a member of a religious community in an abbey or monastery.

Military Orders
* The Sacred Band
	* An order of adventurous paired lovers, often one martial and one mystical.  Each pair typically sees to its own affairs, with only light affiliation to the others.

	* Dividing into septs of ~20 knights (with squires, men-at-arms, etc), which act as independent units.
	* Overseen by a Grandmaster, stationed in Archontos.
	* Kind of like the Templars: champions of the faith, famous warriors, extensive land and mercantile holdings, banking, entangled in affairs of the empire.
* The Black Legion
	* A knightly order composed of very highly placed nobles.  Steeped in tradition and etiquette.

## Criminal / Forbidden

Benevolent Brotherhood
* Centuries old; it's strength waxes and wanes, when it gets too complacent.  Then it has schisms and civil wars and coups and rival upstarts, but it's always come through in some semblance of itself.  It's been challenged by imperial crackdowns, but never bested.
* more-or-less empire-wide reach.  various understandings with various imperial elites, nobles, collegia, etc.
* doesn't try to control every aspect of the street; small gangs, operators, and groups can work under their auspices, tithing and obeying.  they may even get protection and perhaps a monopoly on some level
* yakuza-like internal mythology about being "of the people", looking out for them under the boot of the lords and archons.  and to some degree it's true, varying by time and place.
* they don't do murder for hire, or deal in poisons (partly out of their mythology, and to avoid too much heat, and to avoid clashing with the Vengeance Factor), but they definitely do murder to uphold their own ends.  they do sell services as "retrievers" and spies and also counter-intel advisers.  info brokers and rumormongers.
* ruled by a handful of Eldest Brothers, probably the Elder Brothers of the most major cities.  Elder Brothers run settlement-scale affairs, Brothers run cells of rank-and-file Little Brothers, with trainee and new inductee Youngest Brothers.  Women are Sisters, but the default lingo is man.
	* Lots of street rats yearn to get inducted as Younger Brothers, like becoming a made man.
	* Brotherhood will work to get its people out of trouble with the law, or at least get them lighter sentences.
* Right now is one of those perhaps-weaker times.  The Crimson Trust are rising to oppose them.  The empire's reach is expanding, and so its a race for territory and wealth skimmed from trade and taxes.  Is the Brotherhood weak, are the Lords strong?  Will the empire influence things (it too wants wealth and spying is as important as ever)?  Hard to say.
* They have some very old rites and traditions relating to Khonsu and Bast.

The Vengeance Factor / the Bloody Vespers
* Doesn't officially exist, according to the empire.  Useful enough and quiet enough to avoid enough crackdown to bring them down.
	* A VF assassin who is caught will be abandoned by the VF once they're good and caught, perhaps given some legal aid or considerations in prison / execution.  They keep their mouths shut and hope for the best.  If they blab, they get killed suddenly and painfully.
* Don't go after imperial officials.  You can hire freelancers for that, but the VF doesn't do it.
* They seek to control poison manufacture and sale.

The Crimson Trust
* They are willing to do murder for hire?
* Mortality is their product, Plumthorn works for them, or is at least adjacent?
* A secretive new rival to the Benevolent Brotherhood.  Even the Drome knows little to nothing about them.

The Cult of Set

Hidden Cults of the Outer Gods (at least Tsathoggua)

The Eighth Collegium (The Priscians)

## Foreign

The Hands of Ptah
* the forgehold on Archontos has joined the empire with various generous grants of autonomy.  other holds are not imperial

* Khumus: shamans taught sorcery by the stars, placed for them by Tengri and Ay Dede.
* Ramaali: sha'ir, poet-sorcerers who swayed djinn, and baru (seers) and asipu (wizards) inspired by the lore of Marduk, Erishkigal, and Enki.
	* Also kassafu / kassaptu, witches and warlocks of ill-intent and dark magic.
