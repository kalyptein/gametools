since we've got Thoth and Set, make all the gods real ones?

The Church of the Immortal Flame
* The Immortal Flame is the collective spiritual light of humanity, not a personified being.
	* The souls of the dead faithful dwell within the light, the wicked lose their way and stumble into Darkness.
		* Darkness is home and source of demons, undead, and other wickedness.
	* Saints dwell within the flame, and offer guidance and example to those who call upon them.
	* Recognizes all who have mortal souls as siblings of the human family, including homunculi, trollkin, dwarves, and besherdu.
		* Elves and mi'it are officially "cousins" of humanity, to be welcomed and well-treated, even if they can't directly partake of the faith.
		* Debate continues as to the status of other non-humans, such as ophidians, but it's mostly seen as academic, as they are unknown in the present day.
* The imperial church recognizes the emperor as the Defender of the Faith in the empire.  It doesn't go so quite far as to deny the Caliph's station, but does deny his religious authority and that of his imams.
	* The faith came to the empire from Ramaali during antiquity, but was a minor religion.  After the War of Sortians and Theosophs, when the devastation soured people on the gods and their cults, it began to grow rapidly.  It coexisted with the cults of the Twelve in their decline, eventually eclipsing them.
	* The Ramaali faith is acknowledged as legit, but slightly "inferior", first, but a prototype.  Relations vary wildly, depending on political relations between empire and caliphate.
	* The Cult of Set was officially proscribed after it attempted a coup of the empire.  The emperor Basileus then made the Immortal Flame the official state religion and formalized the imperial church.
* The various "pagan" gods (the Twelve, the Aesir, etc) are acknowledged as powerful and sometimes benevolent, but not their supreme authority is not.
	* They are beings outside the Immortal Flame, to be dealt with as allies, dignitaries, or foes.  Devotions toward them are not forbidden, but in Archontos it's considered quaint and eccentric to worship the Twelve, and only barbarians in need of enlightening would worship other gods.
	* Sorcerers are expected to remain aloof in their dealings with occult beings and gods, and not to submit to or obey them.
* Churches see to spiritual needs, guide the public in pursuit of virtue, tent to the poor, instruct children, and provide magical aid and tending to their communities.
	* Many monastic orders exist to pursue separate lives of religious devotion and/or to focus on specific projects (crusading, scholarship, theology, proselytizing, etc).
* The Pharos, a stylized flame, is the central holy symbol of the Immortal Flame.
	* In Ramaali, it is called a "Manaratan" (beacon / flame / torch) and was part of in their faith's iconography, but not as the central symbol.  Theirs is the "Muqadas" ("the sacred"), a kind of geometric sunburst.

central-asian, but also slavs to byzantium?  maybe also indian?


Ramaali
- as an arabian / middle-eastern vibe, persia to byzantium
- the worship of the Immortal Flame came from here originally into Archontos.  They have their own traditions, organizations, and ties to their own political structures.  It's kind of a Catholic / Orthodox split, usually see themselves as the same "side", the "people of the flame" but variances in doctrine and ties to rival political groups, so sometimes its a bit more christian and muslim
- they have their own pre-flame gods (marduk, ishtar, shamash, enki, anu, enlil, tammuz, erishkigal, nergal, etc)



Outer Gods / Primordials
- Dagon (fish)
- Tiamat (dragon)
- Tsathoggua (bat, toad/salamander) - god of primordial slime, teacher of sorcery, wicked, endless glutton

- Atlach-Nacha (spider)
	- worshipped by some spiders and corrupted grimalkin deep in Arden Vul
- Apep / Yig (snake) - god of the ophidians
	- The early conflict on Archontos between the rising sorcerer-kings and the declining ophidians cemented Yig / Apep as a big villain of their myths
- Mordiggian (jackal, insects?) - death god, undead god, rot and disease and decay
	- use where Thanatos would be referenced
- Gorgo / Mormo (bat?) - vampirism, moon, darkness, night, fear

- Rimmaq-Isfet (salamander / toad)

make each outer god tied to an animal?
