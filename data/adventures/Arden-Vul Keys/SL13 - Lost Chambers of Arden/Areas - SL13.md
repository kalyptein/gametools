## Overview

This level comprises two relatively distinct parts, connected only by a small huldugritti-haunted network of tunnels. The first area contains a set of chambers built during the peak of the Archontean rule in Arden Vul by a small but powerful circle of officials obsessed with the deeds and legends of the imperial heroine, Arden. So intense was their devotion that they created these chambers as a sort of shrine to her, thereby helping elevate her to the status of demigod.  Their cult, known to members as the Defenders of Arden (a pun, as Arden’s nickname was ‘the Defender’), was highly restricted in membership, and its chambers were protected by elaborate entry rituals and safeguards (SL13-8). 

These chambers encompassed several important cultic centers, including the Hall of the Labors (SL13-10), where members of the cult could attempt to emulate the famous Twelve Labors of Arden; the Hall of the Twenty (SL13-20), where statues of the Twenty Worthies are to be found; and the Reliquary of Arden (SL13-22), which contains items thought to be relics of the great Defender. Note might also be made of the grotto of Arden (SL13-2) and its colossal head of the Defender; the grotto is connected to the waterfall’s plunge pool (EX-17). 

The Defenders of Arden maintained a special pentarch of soldiers, the Guardians of Arden, to watch over the cultic areas. When the archon made the fateful decision to withdraw all imperial forces from Arden Vul, the cult ordered the Guardians to stay put. About half the force mutinied, turning on and killing their officers and engaging in fierce battles with their fellows. The few Guardians who survived the fighting were killed by the special imperial stone guardians (see new monsters) who guarded the reliquary.

Those who discover and navigate this part of the sub-level have the opportunity to follow the Path of Arden. Doing so means undergoing twelve potentially lethal tests meant to emulate the Labors of Arden. In addition to the rewards offered by each Labor, successful completion of the first eleven allows one to proceed to the twelfth, wherein it becomes possible to meet the demi-god Arden herself. In this meeting it is possible to acquire the potent artifact known as the spear of Arden (see new magic items), an item which will provide potent aid to those dedicated to stopping Rimmaq-Isfet or Kauket (10-37).

The second region on this sub-level is smaller, consisting of the shuttle bay pod from the Beacon (SL13-37). Within the pod are two shuttles, one of which (SL13-37B) may be used for interstellar travel (for those GMs who wish to allow this). Readying the shuttle for such travel, however, requires that enterprising starfarers first acquire other items (see SL13-37B for details). The shuttle, plus the airlock and runway leading to the exterior (SL13-39), were always the last hope of the rudishva for escape from this planet. It took the engineering and science staff a very long time to devise a way to convert the shuttle from atmospheric to interstellar travel. 

Eventually the team, led by Chemical Engineer Fek-Prail (9-96) and Science Officer Spiv-Kol (SL9-48), reached an innovative solution involving rare minerals from SL9 and the relatively 
ubiquitous arcanum (see new magic items) rocks. But by the time the solution was announced, the kaliyani had already decided to remain on this planet and had begun to plan betrayal. The triumphant news of the solution was thus the trigger for the revolt of the kaliyani and the swift destruction of the rudishva. Therefore, despite their impressive scientific breakthrough, the rudishva never got a chance to use the shuttle.

## Sub-Level 13: 1 - 15

### SL13-1: Entry Tunnels (leading to EX-17)

* Two holes in the plunge pool of the Long Falls (EX-17) lead to the forgotten shrine to Arden the Defender.
	* The western entrance is 35’ below water, the eastern entrance is 40’ below water.  Both are completely water-filled and climb 5' as they extend inward.
	* A strong current, produced by the impact of the waterfall, pushes inward.  Given this current and the one running through SL13-2, it is extremely difficult to swim back into the plunge pool.

### SL13-2: Watery Grotto

* This large cavern is half-filled with water from the plunge pool (EX-17).
	* The tunnels from SL13-1 exit on the floor of the grotto, 30-35’ below the surface.
	* The cavern ceiling, covered by dimly luminescent moss, rises 50’ above the surface.
	* A noticeable current flows towards the entrance to SL13-3; only a skilled swimmer or a (bend bars check for the unskilled) can resist it.
	* The pool teems with fish and small crayfish.
* Those entering the grotto from the tunnels are confronted by a colossal bust of Arden the Defender (SL13-5).  The water line reaches Arden’s lower lip, rendering her visage stern and foreboding.
	* To the west is a worked area, a landing that rises 10’ above the waterline (SL13-4).
	* To the south is a ledge rising 5’ above the waterline.
		* The corpse of a trollkin, mauled by the snapping turtle, rests on the ledge, near the remains of a fire ring.
	* The worked passages leading north are currently 20’ below the surface of the water.
		* Water covers the first 20’ of stairs in each corridor.
		* The stairs are difficult to climb due to the amount of debris washed up inside them – flotsam and jetsam in part, but also bloated, rotted, and decomposed animal and human remains.
		* Those climbing out of the debris into the north-leading corridors have a chance (2 in 6) to hear the sounds of bare feet running near SL13-6.

* The pool is the hunting ground of an ancient and very nasty giant snapping turtle.
	* 33% chance the turtle is hibernating in SL13-3, but movement and especially noise in the grotto are likely (75% chance) to rouse it to investigate.
	* If already in the grotto, it uses its surprise attack on any who emerge from the tunnels (SL13-1).
	* If badly wounded (down more than 2/3 of its HP), the turtle retreats to SL13-3.

* A fair amount of treasure has been swept into the grotto over the years, scattered across the pool floor. Each turn of searching has a 1 in 6 chance to locate an  item.
	* Brooch of confident action (new); a water-tight silver scroll case containing a scroll of Kentillian’s airy command (new); a red glass activation square; a platinum statuette of a discus-thrower (375 gp); a steel cooking pot filled with 438 ancient silver pennies, wrapped tight in a bear skin and bound with rope; a battered but still usable Archontean legionary’s short sword; a shield -1, missile attractor; a helm of comprehending languages and reading magic; an ivory coffer carved with scenes of the Fourth Labor of Arden (225 gp) containing two candles of invocation; two tokens of Arden (av items); a pair of rare bottles of Archontean apple brandy in a leather carrying case (90 gp each); and a scattering of 329 cp, 75 sp, and 51 gp.

1 giant snapping turtle: SZ L; AL N; AC 5 (0); MV 30’, 20’ swimming; HD 10; HP 73; #AT 1; Dmg 6-24. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

### SL13-3: Lair of the Snapping Turtle

* The tunnel to this side cave is 20’ below the surface of the pool in SL13-2.
	* The rock at the bottom of this cave is fractured, allowing water to drain and creating enough current that careless or weak swimmers in SL13-2 will be pulled in.
	* The snapping turtle likes to lie in wait here in the muck (33%) and may retreat here  if badly wounded.

### SL13-4: Landing

* A set of stairs rises 10’ from the water of the grotto to this worked landing.
	* Empty torch sconces are visible along the walls.
	* The west wall is inscribed with 2’-tall letters (Mithric): “Let all persons honor the sacrifice of Arden, founder of this site and defender of her people.”
		* In smaller (6”) letters, below is carved: “Lucullus Axia had this made as thanks to Lady Arden for rescuing him.”
		* Beneath the inscriptions are two clay lamps (unlit) and 3 tarnished ancient silver pennies.

### SL13-5: Colossal Bust of Arden the Defender

* Looming over the grotto (SL13-2) is a colossal sculpture of the head and shoulders of Arden the Defender.
	* Rising 45’ from the base of the grotto almost to its ceiling, the sculpture depicts a solemn Arden in neo-realist Archontean style, wearing a legionary helm and with long warrior braids. 
	* The water level in the grotto has risen over time, so the waterline is just at Arden’s lower lip, making it look as if she is peering across the surface of the water or just emerging from it. Adding to the eerie effect are darkened streaks of stone under her eyes from dripping water.
* A hidden tunnel exists within the nostrils of the colossal head, allowing one to clamber upwards through a 3’-wide passageway to SL13-10.
	* The nostrils are 10’ above the water line, and the passageway climbs 30’ upward at a steep pitch before ending at a secret door.
	* Secret Door (north): opens sliding a rod into a 1” hole in the roof of the tunnel.

### SL13-6: Lytta the Survivor

* A strong reek emanates from the door of the chamber, alerting visitors to the presence of feces and rot long before they reach its broken door.
* This former gathering hall and cloakroom is now the home of a madwoman named Lytta.
	* The frescoes on the walls once depicted upper-class Archonteans in traditional tunics, have been defaced: the heads of all fifty persons scratched out.
		* The walls are smeared with filth and covered with scribbled names.
		* Two are repeated: “Versania” in a stable hand, and “Lytta” in a more uneven, shaky Archontean script.
	* A large wooden table occupies the center of the chamber.
		* There are no chairs  (Lytta burned them all years ago).
	* Piles of broken equipment, skeletonized corpses of humans and animals, and mounds of excrement litter the sides and rear of the chamber.
* If not encountered previously, Lytta will be found here, crouching atop the table and muttering to herself.

Lytta
* Her hair is long and matted, she wears a tattered tunic, and she smells rank.
	* She gives her name as Lytta.  If pressed will agree that once she was Versania.
	* She has a makeshift fishing line, a dagger, and a belt of dwarvenkind that she calls her “seeing belt”, taken years ago from one of the corpses.
* She cannot remember how long she has existed here (12 years).
	* Once upon a time she carried a spear (she was a man-at-arms).
	* A dozen years ago Versania accompanied an expedition to the ruined city.  While horsing around with her fellow men-at-arms, she fell into the plunge pool and was swept into area SL13-2.  She barely escaped the snapping turtle.
	* She has existed here ever since, long bereft of her senses, encountering nobody except the ‘nice corpses’, surviving on raw fish and the flesh of dead creatures swept into the grotto.
* She is clearly insane, but although creepy, she is harmless.
	* She cannot be cured short of a heal spell.
	* She resists contact with explorers, shrieking, kicking, and scratching until physically held down.  At that point she can be questioned, although her answers are difficult to decipher.  If allowed to run free, Lytta will flee towards SL13-2; there she will risk the snapping turtle and attempt to hide out on one of the ledges.
	* So long as the party is present in this sub-level she will shadow the party, muttering softly and acting bizarrely.
* She is afraid of many things:
	* Desperately afraid of ‘it’, the demon of the waters (i.e., the giant snapping turtle).
	* Fears the Hall of the Labors (SL13-10).  ‘Spirits occupy it’ (the only other living occupant of the sub-level died there attempting to overcome one of the labors).
	* The areas to the north (e.g., SL13-13 and beyond) are ‘filled with the dead’ and ‘lack all food’.

Lytta, insane Archontean woman: SZ M; AL N; AC 9; MV 120’; HD 1-1; HP 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (dagger). Possessions: dagger, fishing line, belt of dwarvenkind.

### SL13-7: Antechamber

* The northern door is broken and swings crazily on its hinges; the southern door is intact and locked.
* Above the archway leading to SL13-10 is inscribed (Mithric) “She was immovable and steadfast.”
* Within the bare-walled chamber are the corpses of five long dead Archonteans who slew each other.
	* 2 usable short-swords and 2 spears among the detritus.

### SL13-8: Faces of Arden

* This 15’-tall room was built to prevent those not initiated into the cult of Arden from entering the chambers to the south.
	* A dozen battered and broken corpses lie on the floor, a mix of ancient and modern.
		* 8 ancient Archontean legionaries, 2 lizardmen, a basic exploration automaton of Kerbog Khan (new), and a human adventurer.
			* Returning the automaton’s remains to the Khan might fetch 500-1,000 gp and/or several pieces of valuable information.
		* Among the battered corpses are 2 ancient Archontean shields, 3 Archontean short swords, a scroll of protection from magic, a scattering of 37 ancient silver pennies, 29 ancient gold solidi, 55 sp, and 39 gp, a platinum band (200 gp), and a cap of serenity (new).
	* The east and west walls of the chamber feature 10’-tall carvings of the stylized face of Arden familiar from the colossi (EX-6) and from the watery grotto (SL13-5).
		* Huge faces in a socialist-realist style, with Arden wearing a legionary helm and warrior braids, looking into the middle of the chamber.
		* A 2’-tall, silver-filled inscription is beside the north door (Mithric): “Only those worthy of the loyalty of Arden may proceed further. Be warned!”
	* In the center of the chamber is a 10’-tall, specially designed imperial stone guardian (new) carved to look like Arden herself.
		* It wears legionary gear, but instead of Arden’s spears, it carries hammers.
		* It activates when the southern door is manipulated incorrectly.
	* The door to the south is stone, carved like the face of Arden.
		* A magic mouth speaks to those coming within 3’ (Mithric): “Present signs of your fidelity, and you shall pass.”
		* Up close, slots in the eyes of the door’s face are visible.
		* To open the door, one must either insert into either hole the stone of a ring of Arden (av items) or a token of Arden (av items).
		* Any other manipulation of the door, physical or magical, causes the mouth to intone: “You are found wanting.”  The stone guardian activates to destroy any who remain in the chamber. It does not pursue up the stairs.

Enhanced imperial stone guardian (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 9+3; HP 71; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: hit only by +2 weapons; immune 
to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

### SL13-9: Stairs Up to 4-168

* These stairs wend upwards 700’ before exiting at 4-168. 

### SL13-10: Hall of the Labors

* This long hall is 20’ tall, brightly lit with continual light.
	* In the center is a 20’-diameter circular ‘arena’ set 5’ below the surface of the floor.
		* The relatively recent corpse of a Knight of the Azure Shield lies here, mauled by claws.
			* Banded mail +1, a two-handed sword +2 (INT 13; empathy, Neutral Good, detect evil in a 10’ radius, detect invisible objects in a 10’radius; ego 4), a purse with twenty-five rhodochrosites (10 gp each).
	* The north and south walls features elaborate, well-preserved frescoes illustrating iconic moments from each of the twelve labors of Arden.
		* An inscription in giant 2’-tall, silver-filled letters (75 gp for the silver) occupies the central portion of the north wall, above the sunken area.
			* It reads (Mithric): “Only the worthy should seek to emulate the deeds of the Great Defender. Choose wisely.”
	* The hall is supported by twelve pillars, six on the east side of a central sunken area and six on the west.
		* Eleven of the twelve pillars are carved in a spiral manner telling the story of one of the twelve labors.
			* At eye height on the outer face of each pillar is an Archontean numeral, from I to XI, around which the narrative scenes flow.
			* The twelfth pillar has the numeral XII, but no additional carved images, since the Archonteans believe that Arden’s twelfth labor is still to come.
	* Secret Door (south): difficult to locate (1 in 8 chance), can't be activated from this side (but could be pried and broken open, takes 50 damage, then open doors roll).

* Touching any of the numeral plaques triggers a series of powerful magics.
	* A deep voice speaks (Mithric): “You have chosen to attempt the [First, e.g.] Labor of Arden! Pass through the portal if you dare. Return with proof of your success.”
	* A shimmering, colored (varies by labor), portal, 15’ in diameter opens in the sunken area.
		* Each portal allows access to a demi-plane upon which the labor may be attempted for 2 Turns before closing.
		* A given portal can only be opened once per week.  Once within a demi-plane, one must succeed or else be stranded (or die).
		* Returning through a portal bestows a token of Arden (av items).

* The chamber is perhaps the most important site in the sub-level, and one which might provide canny PCs with important, even crucial, assistance if they choose to fight Kauket (see 10-37).

The Labors of Arden
* The Cult of Arden that created this area wished to test its members by allowing them, to replicate any or all of the famous Labors of Arden.
* Through works of great sorcery (in which Kentillian the archmage was involved), expenditure of much treasure, and many years of plane-walking, the cult created 11 demi-planes in which these trials could take place.
	* The cult imagined that members would proceed through the labors, from easier (1st and 2nd) to more difficult (10th and 11th).
	* Each labor offers the chance (or occasionally the requirement) of difficult combat, but many of the Labors provide alternatives, and for some it is advisable to use stealth and guile rather than brute force.
* Completing the first eleven labors, moreover, allows one to meet Arden the Defender herself (see SL13-10L).
	* Arden, now a demi-god, bestows a powerful artifact, the Spear of Arden Ascended (new) on good-aligned parties who survive the labors. It is invaluable to those seeking to battle Kauket (see area 10-37).

##### SL13-10a: The First Labor: the Owlbears of Mount Juventus

* Fresco: Arden spears an owlbear.
* Pillar: Arden receives a commission from the Emperor, travels through villages, talks to goblin elders dressed in the flamboyant goblin style, climbs the mountain, enters a cave, and slays four owlbears with her spear, returning with feather and fang as proof.
* Portal: A pale yellow portal, leading to a stone column painted pale yellow on the demi-plane.

* The demi-plane consists of a narrow valley surrounded by steep mountain slopes.
	* A small village of 30 goblin miners occupies the valley floor, with their sheep and vegetable gardens.  
	* The mountainsides are riddled with mines and caves.
		* The owl-bear cave is near the top of the mountain, and consists of a 40’-diameter cave with five protruding tunnels that connect to varying layers of the mines.
		* One of the distant mine tunnels leads to a forgotten mine on the actual Mount Juventus, on Mithruin (see World of Archontos Appendix).
	* The goblins speak a debased form of Archontean, and mine the mountain for iron.
		* They happily point visitors towards the source of the problem, and reward their saviors with a set of ebony and silver ninepins (575 gp), a heavy silver soup tureen carved with images of heroic goblins warriors (225 gp), and as many iron ingots as they can carry..

* Labor: Kill all four owlbears.
	* Repeating the Labor: Owlbear eggs are hidden all over the mountain. By the time a week has passed, another group of owlbears will have been born on the demi-plane. If only a week has passed, the new owlbears will have only 2HD and do 1-2/1-2/1-6 damage; they will be fully mature after a month.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Bringing an owl-bear feather and an owl-bear fang to the pale yellow stone column causes the portal to re-open.

4 owlbears: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 5+2; HP 39, 33, 32, 29; #AT 3; Dmg 1-6/1-6/2-12. Special attacks: hug.

##### SL13-10b: The Second Labor: the Troll of Pelousia

* Fresco: Arden stands over a dismembered troll, brandishing her spear and gladius
* Pillar: Trolls pillage, murder, and rape human villagers; the villagers beseech an archon for aid; a logothete hands Arden orders; Arden speaks to a troll of unusual size, while surrounded by other menacing trolls; Arden fights a duel with the large troll; she dismembers it with her gladius; the trolls depart carrying the pieces of their leader, while she claims the collar.
* Portal: A lemon yellow portal leading to a stone circle painted lemon yellow within the demi-plane.

* The demi-plane consists of a 3-mile long canyon with steep, cave-lined walls.
	* The top of the canyon is forested, and home to woodland creatures.
	* A deep but narrow lake occupies the center of the canyon, filled with fish.
	* Thirty bands of trolls make their homes along the canyon walls; fighting each other constantly, subsisting on fish, rabbits and other small game.
		* They are ruled by one larger troll named Edda, who wears a silver collar.

* Labor: Defeat Edda and take his silver collar (50 gp).
	* Demanding to speak to the troll chief will prevent an immediate assault, and Edda is too proud to ignore a challenge to a one-on-one duel to the death / dismemberment.
		* If brought to negative hit points, Edda's collar can be taken. The trolls consider this fair and let the victor and friends depart in peace.
		* Should the victor attempt to burn Edda after his defeat, the other trolls will shout insults and grow menacing; soon attacking.
		* If the visitors’ champion is defeated by Edda, the trolls will enslave the rest of the party for a decade (50%) or kill and eat them (50%).
	* Repeating the Labor: If Edda has not been harmed with fire, he regenerates quickly and retains his office. If slain permanently, the trolls elect a new chieftain within a few days. It takes them a week to construct a new silver collar of office.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Bringing the silver collar to the yellow stone circle causes the portal to open.
	* The holder of the collar and any in a 10’ radius (including trolls) may pass the portal.

Edda the troll: SZ L; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 6+6; HP 40; #AT 3; Dmg 5-8/5-8/2-12. Special defenses: regenerate.

149 trolls: SZ L; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 6+6; HP as needed; #AT 3; Dmg 5-8/5-8/2-12. Special defenses: regenerate.

##### SL13-10c: The Third Labor: the Laughing Lord of the Grain Isles

* Fresco: Arden tosses a medium-sized metal box, within which is a twisted and contorted bipedal figure with tusks, into the waters. 
* Pillar: Three figures in baggy pants and tunics fly above many halflings; the figures stand in the door of a pagoda-like tower, while halflings pile tribute at their feet; halfling leaders consult with Arden; Arden has dinner with the figures, who are seen to have tusks; the tusked figures drink much wine, while Arden pours hers into a potted plant; Arden shows one of the figures an open box; Arden pushes him into it; Arden seals it with candle wax; the other two figures flee; Arden drops the box into water.
* Portal: An orange portal leads to an orange calcite rock, beside which is a lead box of trapping (new).  A pleasant pond stands nearby.

* The demi-plane is a 6-square mile plain, in the center of which is a pagoda of five stories.
	* The plain is planted with grapes, tended by 25 charmed halflings.
		* If the grapes are molested, the halflings attack. Dispel magic ends a halfling’s ensorcelment.
	* A band of ogre magi inhabits the pagoda; every hour one of them flies forth from the upper level to inspect the halflings’ work.
		* If offered a gift, the ogre magi invite the visitors to dine.
		* The wine is enchanted, and causes the imbiber to be susceptible to the ogre magi’s charm spells (-3 to save).
		* The bottom two floors of the pagoda are given over to a wine press and wine storage.
		* The next two provide luxurious living quarters for the ogre magi.
			* 3,412 gp in newly minted imperial coins; a set of 6 masks for a masked ball made of platinum and depicting birds (1,500 pp each); a set of silver and jet jewelry in six pieces (490 gp the set); potions of diminution, human control (x4), polymorph self, speed; a scroll of protection from magic; a pouch of capacity, a returning javelin, and a rod of turning (new for all three).
		* The top floor provides egress to the open air, and a portal to the Astral Plane.

* Labor: The party must get an ogre magi body into the lead box of trapping and drop it into water.
	* An ogre mage might be tricked to look into the box of trapping (base 25% chance w/ a reasonably clever rationale, +10% per flagon of wine they have drunk more than the trickster has, +10% w/ CHA 15 or higher, +5-15% if the plan is quite clever.
	* If the PCs entrap an ogre mage, the others will flee in dismay, and the halflings will be free of their charm.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Hurl the lead box of trapping, containing an ogre mage (alive or dead), into water (e.g. the pond by the portal). The portal to Arden Vul reopens. There is also a portal to the Astral Plane in the ogre magi’s pagoda.
	* Repeating the Labor: a new band of ogre magi occupy the pagoda within 1-6 weeks. It takes them an additional 3-6 months to acquire suitable halfling slaves.

25 charmed halfling vinicultivators: SZ S; AL NG; AC 7; MV 90’; HD 1-6 HP; HP 6(x4), 5(x4), 4(x6), 3(x6), 2(x2), 1(x2); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon (sling, spear, dagger).

##### SL13-10d: The Fourth Labor: the Three Berserkers of Westholm

* Fresco: Arden holds a necklace of bear-claws on the tip of her spear; she stands over the corpses of three barefoot, mail-clad Wiskin warriors 
* Pillar: An imperial emissary arrives at a Wiskin hall, carrying the fasces of authority; the jarl, who wears a necklace of bear-claws, refuses the emissary entrance to his hall; three barefoot Wiskinga, dressed in mail and furs, bite their shields and roll their eyes; they impale the emissary on their spears; Arden arrives; she dines in the jarl’s hall; she drinks horns of ale with a Wiskin; she arm-wrestles another Wiskin; she beats a third Wiskin in a foot race; the three barefoot Wiskinga appear again, biting their shields; the jarl folds his arms; Arden fights and slays the berserkers; the jarl bows his head and presents his bear-claw necklace. 
* Portal: A cherry red portal conveys the PCs to a wintry forest, where a red-painted standing stone marks the spot.

* The demi-plane is one of constant winter, snow and wind.
	* A faint track leads from the standing stone through the forest; after two miles it leads to a clearing, where two Wiskin structures sit.
		* Several packs of winter wolves roam the forests; 2-in-6 every hour to attract a pack.  Once in the Wiskin clearing, though, visitors are safe from wolves.
	* One is a sunken long hall, some 75’ long and 20’ wide. The other is a stable, 30’ long by 15’ wide, holding 8 reindeer, and two sledges.
		* The long hall is brightly lit, with wood smoke coming from its central fire hole. Those seeking hospitality are greeted in a surly manner, but eventually allowed to enter the hall.
		* Within Jarl Bjorn Bear-brother holds court among his thirty-six Wiskin warriors. The jarl is a huge man, 6’6” tall, and built like a bear. His supporters are lean and tough, and seem more like foresters than farmers or servants. The jarl offers hospitality for four nights. 
			* If all the Wiskinga are slain, a chest with 23,924 cp, 11,299 sp, sixteen heavy gold arm rings (100 gp each), and three potions of invulnerability may be looted.

* Labor: The visitors can either fight all of the Wiskinga, or attempt to complete four contests, one during each of the four nights allotted by the jarl.
	* Days are spent drinking, jesting, and playing games. At night, the contests occur.
	* The first night
		* A huge Wiskin named Thorir (CON 18) challenges the party to a drinking contest. Any or all of the party may join in drinking horns of ale.
			* Anyone can drink CON/3 horns easily; each extra horn roll under CON (initially 4d6, +1d6 per 2 extra horns).  Fail and vomit and pass out.
	* The second night
		* Another large Wiskin named Croul challenges the PCs to an arm-wrestling match, best of 3.  Each contestant rolls 3d6+(2x hit bonus from STR).
		* Croul has an 18/93 STR (+4 to rolls).
	* The third night
		* A slim Wiskin warrior maiden named Helga challenge the PCs to a footrace, four times around the long house.
		* A contestant’s time in minutes = d6+6 - (DEX adjustment to AC) - (CON adjustment to HP).  If results are tied, the race is re-run.
		* Helga has DEX 17 and CON 16 (D6+1).
	* The fourth night
		* Several (7 - 1 for each contest won by one of the PCs) crazed berserkers arrive and attempt to kill the PCs.  Jarl Bjorn refuses all requests for aid.
		* If they are defeated, the jarl voluntarily gives his necklace to the victors.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: To reactivate the portal to Arden Vul, one must bring the jarl’s bear-claw necklace (amulet of proof against detection and location) to the red-painted standing stone.
	* One of the forest paths leads to the most remote mountain forests of Borealios (see World of Archontos appendix).
	* Repeating the Labor: The jarl creates a new bear-claw necklace within 1-3 weeks. If slain, a new jarl occupies the hall in 2-4 months.

##### SL13-10e: The Fifth Labor: the Greedy Jarl

* Fresco: A yellow-haired, white-skinned giant prostrates itself before Arden, who carries her spear and torch. The corpses of two white wolves are nearby.
* Pillar: A trio of giants, accompanied by huge wolves, stride towards a village; villagers empty coins and food into their sacks; the giants visit another village; Arden and Vul appear at the giants’ hall; Arden slays both wolves; Arden kills two giants with spear and flame, while Vul blasts another with magic; they present the giants’ heads to the emperor on a round platter.
* Portal: A burgundy portal leads to a snow-swept forest and a horizontally-mounted, wooden, wagon-wheel painted burgundy.

* The demi-plane consists of a wide broken countryside of pine forests, ravines, and gullies, all covered with a foot of snow.
	* A simple log-and-daub fort, 100’ x 75’ x 20’, is found on the spine of a ridge two miles from the portal.
		* The fort contains a main hall, with fire pit, kitchen and long benches, plus three chambers and a pair of storerooms.
		* Three frost giants and their six winter wolf pets call the hall home.
		* They have 5,907 gp, 769 pp, three huge silver candlesticks (25 gp each), a golden crown one giant wears as a ring (75 gp), and a dagger +3.
		* The pelts of the winter wolves are worth 5,000 gp each. 

* Labor: The visitors must slay at least one frost giants.
	* If the PCs are lucky, they may catch a giant visiting the latrine outside the fort.
	* The winter wolves will attempt to flank the PCs, while the giants wade in with massive swords.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Placing a giant’s head on the painted wheel reopens the portal to Arden Vul.
	* A cave located deep within the forest leads to an alternate exit: a hidden cave in the snowy mountains many miles north of Arden Vul.
	* Repeating the Labor: The giants’ hall will be reoccupied within 1-3 months. 

3 frost giants: SZ L; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 10+1-4; HP 72, 70, 68; #AT 1; Dmg 4-24. Special attacks: hurl rocks (2-20 dmg). Special defenses: immune to cold.

6 winter wolves: SZ L; AL N(E); AC 5; MV 180’; HD 6; HP 44, 41, 40, 38, 37, 35; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: frost blast. Special defenses: immune to cold.

##### SL13-10f: The Sixth Labor: the Lost Legion

* Fresco: The kneeling heroes, Arden, Vul, and Lucius Minux (see SL4-24), present two items to the emperor, a triangular phlamoulon (standard) and a grapefruit-sized acorn.
* Pillar: A unit of heavy cavalry (kataphracts) rides forth carrying a phlamoulon bearing the numeral V; they ride through a canyon; a tunic-clad man greets the polemarch at the head of the column; the man stabs the polemarch; and barbarians ambush the troopers with arrows from the canyon heights; the tunic-clad man takes the phlamoulon; Arden, Vul, and a companion view the dead legionaries; the trio visit a Thorcin longhouse; they question several Thorcinga; they travel into the forest; they enter a clearing with several huts and a decrepit stone building; the heroes fight the man in the tunic, as well as several priests; they find the phlamoulon and two enormous acorns within the stone building; they present the phlamoulon and an acorn to the emperor.
* Portal: A sky blue portal leading to a massive beech tree. Nailed to the tree is a board with the words “Danger” painted in blue paint.

* The demi-plane is a vast, old-growth forest of huge beeches, oaks, and maples, studded with clear brooks and streams, extending for scores of miles in every direction.
	* The demi-plane is holy to Fenth, the harsh Thorcin lord of tree and forest, and a shrine to this deity lies at the center of the forest.
	* The shrine to Fenth consists of a crumbling, vine-encased, roofless stone building about 20’x40’. Nearby are two sturdy huts made of fallen tree limbs.
		* A necromantic ‘priest’ of Fenth lives in one hut, his 2 assistants live in the other.
		* Within the shrine is a blood-soaked stone altar surrounded by rose bushes. Hanging on the wall behind the altar is an Archontean phlamoulon (of the XV velites); atop the altar are two grape-fruit sized acorns of Fenth (new).
			* Buried under the stone floor of the fane are 8 copper pots: 4 pots have 6,000 cp each; 2 have 4,000 sp each, and 2 have 2,000 gp.
		* A trap door in the floor of the priest’s hut drops down 10’ to a 3’-diameter tunnel that, after many thousands of feet, ends in an elaborately carved wooden door.  Those exiting the door find themselves tumbling 5’ from a doorway carved into a living mallorn tree located in the heart of the elven realm of Lady Ellagel and Lord Gallador (see World of Archontos appendix). 

* Labor: The visitors must locate the shrine of Fenth and recover either the phlamoulon and one of the acorns.
	* Doing so requires defeating the priest, his assistants, and some summoned monsters.
	* Without a tracker, it takes 2-12 days to stumble upon the shrine to Fenth; a ranger can manage this feat in 3-24 hours.  Random encounters in the forest, with all manner of predator and prey, are possible if the GM wishes.
	* There is a 75% chance that the priest is making a sacrifice when the PCs arrive; if not, he is in his hut.
	* The assistants attack immediately. The priest first raises eight Fenth zombies (new) from the turf around the shrine, and then summons two harvest lords (new). Only then does he enter combat in support of his minions.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Bringing either the phlamoulon and an acorn of Fenth to the entry beech tree reopens the portal.
	* Repeating the Labor: A new priest of Fenth will be called to serve the god within 1-4 weeks. The priest will be a magic user (33%), druid (33%), or cleric (33%).

High priest of Fenth (formerly Bastolf of Narsileon), 8th-level male Thorcin magic user: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 26; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (staff of Fenth). Abilities: STR 12, INT 
17, WIS 11, DEX 16, CON 9, CHA 14. Possessions: bracers of defense (AC 4); staff of Fenth (see new magic items); amulet of spell turning (18 spells levels left); two potions of invisibility; eyes of Fenth (see new magic items).

8 Fenth zombies (see new monsters): SZ M; AL NE; AC 8; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 25(x8); #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/2-8; MR 25%. They cannot be turned while near the shrine.

2 harvest lords (see new monsters): SZ M; AL NE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 6+6; HP 43, 39; #AT 2; Dmg 2-12/2-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: ignite flammables (10%).

##### SL13-10g: The Seventh Labor: the River God

* Fresco: Arden and Vul are standing in a river; Vul holds a giant triton shell triumphantly in one hand, while Arden spears the water.
* Pillar: Arden and Vul climb a massive cliff, down which pours a waterfall; they attempt to cross the river to an island in its midst, but their pack horse is swept away by the river; Vul waves his arms in a spell; the water forms into a shape and attacks the pair; Arden uses her spear to attack the water creature; the pair rest; a second creature attacks them; Vul spies a giant triton shell lodged in a rock near the island and beneath the waves; Arden swims into the river to recover the shell; she is attacked by the water creature; while she fends it off, Vul smashes the shell on a rock.
* Portal: A navy blue portal leads to a 10’-diameter cave with a ledge that overlooks a massive saltwater grotto. On the floor of the entrance cave is incised a crude image of a triton shell.

* The demi-plane consists solely of the grotto, linked to the Elemental Plane of Water.
	* The grotto is a used by elemental lords of water to farm giant tritons, whose shells are used as symbols of authority.
	* The grotto is ringed on all sides by stone; the drop from the cave to the water surface is 30’. The grotto is 75’ deep and five miles in diameter, and strong currents run through the seawater.
	* The floor of the lake is covered with coral and coral-dwelling creatures, including large sea stars, sea cucumbers, and ten giant tritons (see new monsters).

* Labor: procure a giant triton shells and smash it on the floor of the cave.
	* In addition to fighting one of the giant tritons beneath the surface of the water, the party must repel the large water elemental that defends the grotto.
	* While it is relatively easy to target a single triton from the surface of the water, extended combat in one location has a 33% chance of drawing 1-2 more giant tritons within 3-6 rounds.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Smashing a giant triton shell on the floor of the entry cave reopens the portal.
	* If tracked, the current in the grotto leads to a second portal opening directly on to the Elemental Plane of Water.
	* Repeating the Labor: There are 10 giant tritons in the grotto. If all are slain, it takes the lords of elemental water 3-6 months to replace the stock. Slain water elementals are replaced in 2 days.

10 giant sea tritons (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 0 (shell) or 4 (body); MV 30’; HD 12; HP 88, 86, 84, 83, 80, 79, 78, 76, 75, 73; #AT 1; Dmg 6-24. Special attacks: paralysis; swallow prey.

1 water elemental: SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’, 180’ in water; HD 16; HP 103; #AT 1; Dmg 5-30. Special attacks: affect boats. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit.

Up to nine giant triton shells (one must be destroyed to exit the demi-plane, 1,500 gp each).

##### SL13-10h: The Eighth Labor: the Hidden Priest

* NB: replacing Jael priests with Apep priests.

* Fresco: Arden and Vul stand over a dead priest, holding up a torc from which depends a quarter-moon. 
* Pillar: priests of each of the Twelve gather in conclave, with hidden daggers and heap of wealth; a village headman and his daughter plead with a chartoularios seated behind his desk; the chartoularios consults with the priests; the chartoularios sends the man and daughter away with a beating; the headman is found dead; the daughter bows before Arden and Vul; Vul lurks in the temple of Osiris, while the Osiris priests surreptitiously steal from the faithful; Arden, disguised, begs / spies in the temple of Isis; Arden knocks the headdress from the priestess of Isis, revealing a diadem with the (kaliyani) Ouroboros symbol of Apep / Yig; Arden and Vul find a hidden shrine, with a Ouroboros-marked altar; they destroy it; they deliver the torc to the shamed chartoularios.
* Portal: A turquoise portal leads to a set of stone flagstones with a stone box atop a plinth.

* The demi-plane is a barren rock plateau one mile in diameter with a 100’-tall, 100’-wide mesa in its center.
	* The view from the portal is thus a towering rock face about 2/3 mile away.
	* Set into the rock face are shrines to each of ‘the Twelve’ (Anubis, Hathor, Horus, Isis, Khonsu, Osiris, Ptah, Ra, Set, Thoth, Bastet, and Sekhmet).
	* Each shrine consists of a 5’-deep hollow in the rock face; within each niche is a marble statue of the relevant deity, facing forward in the traditional pose.
		* The background of the shrines is carved like the interior of a temple, with numerous offerings piled up.
		* Each shrine except Isis has a hidden compartment, all associated with a depiction of wealth in the carved backdrop, containing a key.
		* The statue of Isis in her shrine has a subtle keyhole in the back of her head, unlocked by the key from any other shrine.  Unlocked it allows the headdress to be lifted off, revealing a compartment with a diadem of Apep (50 gp).
	* The top of the plateau is littered with broken skeletons and broken equipment.
		* A deadly iron golem constructed to resemble a priestess of Isis guards the top, attacking those who ascend from either direction.
		* Her headdress also has a keyhole (same key), which opens a compartment holding a lodestone pendant.
	* The rock face on the far side of the plateau appears void of interest.
		* A secret door leads to a shrine of Apep.  The lodestone pendant points to it.
		* Inside is an altar and statue of Apep.  Breaking open the altar reveals a platinum diadem of Apep (250 gp).

* Labor: The visitors must locate the shrine of Apep and recover the true diadem, ignoring the tempting but incorrect diadem from the statue of Isis.
	* Those climbing the plateau are confronted by the iron golem and must avoid it or defeat it.  It's lodestone will help find the shrine of Apep, but isn't required.
	* The golem is likely (66%) to hear those climbing either rock face, and attempts to dislodge climbers as they near the top. The golem is slow, so it might be possible to avoid it once the plateau has been reached.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: placing a true diadem of Apep into the stone box on the entrance flagstones reopens the portal.
	* Placing the false diadem in the box causes it to transform into a venomous serpent and strike at the one who put it there (save or die).
	* Repeating the Labor: There are a fixed number of true torcs, so if visitors remove or destroy all of them, all subsequent visitors will be stranded.

1 iron golem: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 18; HP 80; #AT 1; Dmg 4-40. Special attacks: poison gas. Special defenses: +3 or better weapons to hit; immune to all magic except electricity, which slows it; healed by fire.

##### SL13-10i: The Ninth Labor: Singing the Dead to Sleep

* Fresco: Arden and Vul stand inside a cemetery, with dead legionaries sleeping quietly within their stone sarcophagi. Arden holds her spear in two hands, but has a legionary’s trumpet hanging from a cord around her neck. Vul appears in his classic pose, arms crossed with each holding a wand; a lute is strapped to his back. 
* Pillar: Dead legionaries clamber from their crypts and tombs; the dead wander among a village; villagers flee and shutter their windows; Arden and Vul appear; Arden skewers many of the dead with her spear, Vul uses his wands, and a priest of Thoth (Ristus, aka Ptoh-Ristus – see 3-66) presents a holy symbol; the dead return; the trio fight again; an aulos-playing dead man appears; Arden blows a ram’s horn and Vul strums a lute; the aulos player drops his instrument; the other dead legionaries return to their graves.
* Portal: a pale green portal leads to a marble pedestal 15’ in diameter that stands 15’ above the floor of a vast crypt.

* The demi-plane consists entirely of a 300’x300’ x50’ space carved out of rock.
	* A breeze blows from vents in all four sides.
	* The entry pedestal is in the center of the chamber.  Surrounding it and occupying the rest of the crypt are endless rows of sarcophagi.
		* The sarcophagi are about 6’x3’x5’ and lack lids; there are 1,238 sarcophagi total.
		* Each sarcophagus contains a partially embalmed but quite decrepit human form (once a legionary).
		* Four of the sarcophagi are different, placed in the four corners of the chamber (210’ diagonally from the center), and made of well-carved white marble.
	* When the plane is entered, the haunting sound of a lone aulos playing a military march fills the crypt, and the legionaries begin to rise as ghasts.
		* Forty ghasts are active at all times, so as ghasts are slain or turned, more rise from their crypts.

* Labor: One must quiet the dead, either through prodigious feats of arms (1,234 ghasts!) or cleverness.
	* The ghasts can be turned, but those not turned attempt to overwhelm visitors and tear them apart. The ghasts even clamber atop each other so as to reach top of the central pedestal.
	* The most sensible solution is to quiet the dead by defeating the aulos-playing legionary.
	* The aulos player rises from the marble crypt in the northeast corner, and remains by his crypt, playing his haunting melodies.
		* PCs can attempt to slay him, but he is revealed to be a type of groaning spirit, and resists with keening voice and claws.
		* There are musical instruments (finely made, 100 gp each) in the sarcophagi in the other three corners (northwest, southeast, southwest); a lute, a trumpet, a cithara, and a pair of hand drums.
		* Should two PCs play any two of the instruments within 40’ of the aulos player, he is defeated: he retreats to his sarcophagus, and the ghasts return to their sarcophagi. 

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Bringing the aulos (an aulos of undead command, new) back to the raised pedestal causes the portal to reopen. 
	* Repeating the Labor: Four sets of musical instruments exist, one set in each of the marble sarcophagi. When all the instruments have been taken away, the magic of the demi-plane ceases to work; the portal will never open again.

1,234 ghasts: SZ M; AL CE; AC 4; MV 150’; HD 4; HP 30, 25, 23, 21, and as needed; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-8. Special attacks: stench; paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

Groaning spirit (modified): SZ M; AL CE; AC 0; MV 150’; HD 7; HP 47; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8; MR 50%. Special attacks: wail. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to charm, sleep, hold, cold, and electricity.

##### SL13-10j: The Tenth Labor: the Fallen Mage

* Fresco: Arden and Vul stand outside a crypt (identifiable by the skulls within it); Arden holds a round emblem embossed with an image of a heron eating a fish.
* Pillar: A mage advises the emperor; the mage is wearing a large brooch featuring a heron eating a fish; the same mage lies down in a crypt; the mage rises from the crypt, his flesh drawn and gaunt as if long embalmed; the undead mage points his finger at a courtier, who drops; the undead mage collects books from the dead courtier’s library; Arden and Vul enter a house with the heron-and-fish symbol; they defeat skeletons and ghouls; they enter a crypt, and defeat constructs made of clay or flesh; they face off against the undead mage; the undead mage presents the pair with a talisman with the heron eating a fish and returns to his crypt; Arden offers the talisman to the emperor.
* Portal: An emerald green portal leads to a dusty corridor, where a faded emerald green image of Arden has been painted on the stone wall.  A stone box on a plinth stands nearby, with the carved outline of a talisman with a heron eating a fish inside it.

* The demi-plane is actually the deadly crypt of the ancient archmage-turned-lich, Apollonius of Archontos.
	* Apollonius is more than 2,300 years old. He prepared this demi-plane as the site for his lichdom, whence he could travel the planes and acquire further magical power.
	* Apollonius is incredibly powerful and nigh invulnerable in his crypt, since he has stored pieces of his phylactery in three other small demi-planes.
	* Most of the time Apollonius spends his time in semi-slumber, while his mind pursues important magical threads through the Astral and other planes. His consciousness can return to his crypt, however, at which point his might and anger are formidable.
	* The crypt involves a long central chamber surrounded by an ambulatory corridor, from which radiate storerooms, libraries, a laboratory, and the crypts of his apprentices and minions. 
		* Apollonius’s lair is crammed with tens of thousands of gold pieces worth of art, antiquities, and other treasure, as well as scores of important magic items.

* Labor: One must acquire one of Apollonius’s talismans (with the symbol of Apollonius, a heron with a fish on them, 500 gp each) and escape before Apollonius turns the full might of his attention towards the intruders.
	* Apollonius resides in the central chamber of the crypt, in one of six identical thrones; the other five are occupied by his close advisors, who include a skeleton warrior, several ghoul lords, and three bound rending demons (see new monsters).
	* Other powerful undead flit about the chamber. More minions guard and occupy the radiating storerooms and lesser crypts.
		* Six flesh golems, each wearing a talisman bearing Apollonius’s symbol (a heron with a fish in its mouth), patrol the ambulatory corridor. It is possible – and recommended – for those completing the labor to fight the flesh golems, take one of the talismans, and thus avoid the more deadly denizens of Apollonius’s lair. 
		* PCs should encounter a flesh golem within 2 rounds of exiting the portal, before much of the complex can be explored.
			* At this time there is a 50% chance that Apollonius’s consciousness is present in his crypt; if so, his thin, reedy, menacing voice booms from the mouths of golems, inviting thieves to enter his sanctum and there meet their doom.
			* Doing so is foolhardy, and recommended only for very high level parties. A kind GM should drop further hints about the dangers of the crypt via Apollonius’s taunts.
			* If Apollonius’s consciousness is not present (50%), then the complex will be under guards and wards, the doors to the central chamber will be barred and wizard locked (at 25th level), and Apollonius’s voice will not be present.
			* Only if intruders spend more than 2 turns in his complex will Apollonius return to deal with the intruders. Defeating one of the flesh golems and taking its talisman is thus sufficient to accomplish the labor. 

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Unlike most other portals connected to the labors of Arden, this portal may be reopened simply by touching the emerald-green sketch of Arden on the corridor wall, even if one has not acquired one of the astral talismans.  Placing a talisman inside the box completes the labor.
	* Repeating the Labor: Each of the six flesh golems wears one of Apollonius’s talismans.  If somehow all six flesh golems are killed and all six talismans taken, Apollonius will replace the golems and talismans at a rate of one per month. If Apollonius himself is killed, then no new talismans may be created.

18 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 14(x4), 12(x4), 11x 4, 10(x4), 8x2; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm; 
turned as ghasts while in the domain of Apollonius.

##### SL13-10k: The Eleventh Labor: the Dragon’s Egg

* Fresco: Arden and Vul stand in front of an enormous, glowering red dragon; each of the heroes is holding a dragon’s egg.
* Pillar: A dragon breathes fire on Archonteans in a settlement by a river; Arden and Vul arrive; they follow the dragon to its lair atop a mountain peak; they fight the dragon with spear and spell; Arden slips past the dragon and inspects three eggs; Arden and Vul speak and gesture to the dragon; the dragon departs; the heroes take one egg and present it to the emperor.
* Portal: A forest green portal opens atop a stone circle set in the turf of a vast plain.

* The demi-plane consists of a classic plain of undulating native grasses, through which runs a wide river.
	* The plain is home to large herds of buffalo and is theoretically endless.
	* The only break in the plain is a cinder cone 12 miles from the entry point that rises thousands of feet into the sky.
		* A pair of huge ancient red dragons have their lair in a ruined building’s basement at the top of the cinder cone.
		* The reds hunt buffalo and occasionally use a second portal to visit the Prime Material Plane (see “exiting the demi-plane”, below). 

* Labor: The visitors must secure a dragon egg from the lair of the red dragons.
	* Currently there are three eggs. They can be obtained by force or stealth.
	* The dragons nest in in a caldera atop the cinder cone; the caldera has a lake and the dragons’ vast mound of treasure.
		* 23,192 cp; 6,873 sp; 88,135 gp; 85 gems; 10 pieces of jewelry; potions of climbing, diminution, fire resistance, growth, and levitation; a scroll (anti-magic shell, geas); a scroll (phase door, reverse gravity); a scroll (trap the soul); a scroll (monster summoning I, monster summoning II); a scroll (comprehend languages, tongues); a scroll (feeblemind, hold monster and stone shape); a scroll (reincarnate); a scroll (resurrection); a long sword +2, giant slayer; a suit of splint mail +3; a chime of opening, and a bag of holding (of largest capacity).

	* Since dragons are adept at detecting even the invisible, the stealth route require locating some lava tubes within the cinder cone, and using them to traverse the cone to emerge at the caldera.
		* The dragons aren’t aware of the tunnels. In the tunnels there is a 50% chance that PCs will encounter a troop of salamanders.
	* Once even one egg is in the hands of the PCs, the adults (if still alive) will negotiate, fearing to harm their progeny.
		* Their response depends on the number of eggs taken (or claimed) by the PCs.
			* If one egg is taken, Malliastorin bows her head and intones the following in Mithric: “So, the Compact is maintained even in these young days? Depart in peace.”
			* If two eggs are taken, Malliastorin responds: “You dare breach the compact? So be it. We have marked your scent, humans [or whatever], and will hunt you if we can.”
			* If three eggs are taken, Malliastorin snarls “Beware, thieves. Our wrath will follow you across the planes.”

* GM Note: the dragons are referring to the ancient Compact of Ennius, by which the Archontean Empire struck an alliance with dragonkind and surrendered some eggs to the service of the Emperor (see World of Archontos appendix).
	* Malliastorin is aware that the Compact was breached prior to the war of Sortians and Theosophs, but assumes the PCs wish to re-invoke it.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: Bringing a dragon egg (15,000 gp each) to the stone circle reopens the portal.
	* Two other exits exist: the lowest lava tubes lead to the Elemental Plane of Fire, while a silver portal in the sky leads to a similar portal 100’ above the ruins of Agoreon on the coast of Ostralios (see World of Archontos appendix).
	* Repeating the Labor: If only one egg is taken, the other two are still available for 6-18 months, at which point they hatch into baby red dragons. If all three are taken, it takes 18 months for the adults to produce a new egg.

Malliastorin, female huge ancient red dragon: SZ L; AL CE; AC -1; MV 90’, 240’ flying (Class E); HD 11; HP 88; #AT 3; Dmg 1-8/1-8/3-30.

##### SL13-10l: The Twelfth Labor: the Unknown Labor

* Fresco: There is no fresco; the wall is blank.
* Pillar: The pillar is uncarved; only the numeral plaque is evident.
* Portal: A white portal opens in an eerie landscape in which white fog rises three feet above a barren plain.

 * The demi-plane is endless and featureless, except for a 50’-diameter circle of marble pillars a mile away.
	 * In the center of the circle is a mosaic depicting an ancient legionary, next to which is a single word in Mithric: “Arden”.
	 * The demi-plane is empty, unless the other eleven labors have been completed.
	 * If the labors have been completed, Arden the Defender awaits the heroes within the circle of pillars, dressed in ancient legionary equipment, leaning wearily on her famous spear.

* Labor: One must complete all previous eleven labors (SL13-10a through SL13-10j). If one has done so, an avatar of the demi-god, Arden the Defender, awaits.

Arden
* Speaks slowly in Mithric.
* She congratulates good-aligned PCs on being true heroes, upon whose steadfastness and courage the empire’s foundations rest. She thanks them for defending the ‘sacred location’ that she and her partner, Vul, discovered and developed.
* Casual conversation with Arden is possible once the bona fides of the visitors have been established.
	* Although the mortal Arden died long before the glory days of Archontean rule in Arden Vul, Arden the demi-god possesses complete knowledge of the current layout of the complex, along with accurate information about inhabitants and their capabilities.
	* She is willing to spend 3-6 hours conversing with good-aligned heroes, and can, at the GM’s will, impart information about the Halls, about the Empire, and/or about any other subject of interest to the PCs.
* She tasks them with defeating ‘the ancient, amphibian evil that is rising in the depths’.
	* Refers to the heqeti, to Kauket, and to Rimmaq-Isfet (see Level 10 in general and 10-37 in particular).
	* To aid them in that righteous task, and to reward them for their obvious sacrifices, she bestows upon them the Spear of Arden Ascended (new).
		* The actual spear wielded by Arden in life (the ebon spear - new) is located at area SL5-13a, this spear is a divine weapon, with significantly greater powers.
			* Its use is also contingent on the mortal wielder’s morality and intentions; the spear will return to Arden if passed to an evil character, or even if a good wielder does not pursue the path set by Arden.
			* Arden will not permanently alienate her spear, and appears on the prime material plane at some point to repossess it.
			* PCs to whom she has gifted the spear have six months before she materializes and demands to know their progress. If the PCs can convince her that they are still actively working to defeat Kauket, she allows them to retain the spear for an additional 2-4 months (or more). If she is unconvinced, the spear flies back to her hand and she teleports away.
	* Should the PCs defeat Kauket with the help of her spear, Arden appears within 4-7 days to thank the victors and reclaim her spear.
		* It might be possible to convince her at that point that the spear is needed for another grave task; doing so would take tremendous diplomacy and tact on the part of PCs, and should require some serious role playing.
		* Only if specific and conclusive evidence of a great evil threat can be produced will Arden be willing to grant the PCs another six-month term as wielders of her spear.
		* Arden is fairly tolerant regarding the alignment of parties who have completed her labors. Only if a party is obviously evil, governed by selfishness and greed, does she withhold her favors. In such cases she slowly sizes up the PCs and then contemptuously notes “You are not heroes.” She then teleports away.

* Exiting the Demi-plane: The portal remains open so long as parties are visiting the demi-plane, regardless of whether Arden is present or not. 
	* Repeating the Labor: The spear is unique.

### SL13-11: Damaged Antechamber

* The northern wall caved in centuries ago, blocking all passage.
	* The corpse of an Archontean dekarch lies slumped against the west wall.
		* He holds a short sword (+1 luckblade, no wishes) and shield, his torso filled with crossbow bolts and broken spear shafts.
		* In his leather satchel is a deluxe, illustrated copy of the Twelve Labors of Arden (books).
	* Near him lie the corpses of three legionaries, killed by short-sword thrusts.
		* One has 15 ancient gold solidi concealed in a boot.
* Over the arch leading to the stairs to SL13-10 is the inscription (Mithric): “Fidelity was her guiding light.”

### SL13-12: Shrine and Preparation Chamber

* The door to this chamber has been broken down; it hangs in tatters on its hinges.
* A long stone bench parallels each of the diagonal walls. 
* In the center is a 10’-diameter pool of clear liquid. 
	* Anyone who strips and bathes in the pool benefits from cure disease and remove curse (once per year per individual).
* East of the pool is a shrine to Arden, a piece of red granite 8’ tall, with eleven niches carved into the side facing west.
	* In the niches are two 18” ivory statuettes of Arden as spearwoman (100 gp each), a cracked leather packet holding human hair, a decrepit leather thong strung through 17 ancient copper bits, and a small vial of evaporated perfume.
* The east wall is covered by two 15’-tall frescoes of Arden.
	* The left image shows her as a spatharios, or simple legionary; the right shows her in the toga of a decurion.
	* Inscribed between (Mithric): “Those who would take up the labors of the Great Defender must purify themselves.”

* GM Note: In antiquity those seeking to perform one of the labors (SL13-10) spent a day and a night here in meditation.

### SL13-13: Barricade and Corpses

* A crude barricade of barrels, spears, and ancient chains bisects this former guard point.
	* The time-rotted corpses of 7 ancient legionaries lie east of the barricade
	* 4 more corpses slump atop the barricade, as if trying to climb it.
	* Among the corpses are 57 ancient silver pennies and 19 ancient gold solidi. Their equipment is rusted and unusable.
* The south wall has a peeling fresco of Arden the Defender striding among legionaries.

* GM Note: The pentarch of the Guardians of Arden (see SL13-23) ordered his men to stay at their posts when the order came to evacuate the city and subterranean halls.
	* Half the legionaries revolted, and a desperate internecine struggle ensued; the corpses here are a sign of that fratricide.

### SL13-14: Chapter House

* The chamber is 20’ tall with a fine ribbed vault.
	* The center contains a fire pit, with long-cold ashes, and a rostrum facing west, towards the seats.
* Set into the walls are twenty stone stalls, one for each member of the Defenders of Arden.
	* Each stall is set 2’ into the wall, with a hinged wooden seat covering a cupboard beneath (all empty).  Above each stall is carved a unique image of an Archontean hero (one of the Twenty Worthies – see SL13-20).
	* The seats for Arden and Vul are directly opposite the entrance doors.
		* A toga-clad, desiccated, corpse is sprawled across the seat of Vul, stabbed with spears, one of which is still present in its throat.
			* A huge codex bound in red leather, the Red Book of the Defenders of Arden (books) has fallen from the corpse’s hand.
		* The stalls of Arden and Vul contain secret compartments.
			* In Arden’s stall, it opens by pressing the left eye of her image.
			* In Vul’s stall, it opens by twisting the entire face of Vul 90-degrees left.
				* Each compartment is only 4” square, and each contains a ring of Arden (av items).  Vul’s also contains a scroll with the Liturgy of the Strong (books).
					* Removing either ring causes the spirit of Justus to attack.
	* The stall of Phocion the Builder contains a secret door.
		* Normal to locate, flipping a catch under Phocion’s seat causes the door to spring inward, revealing a short corridor to the treasury.

* A ghostly spirit lingers near the corpse, whispering (Mithric) imprecations and blandishments.
	* Difficult to make out, but include phrases such as “Protect the relics,” “Do not let them take the relics,” “Duty is honor,” “Honor is duty,” “We must remain until summoned,” and so forth.
	* Benign unless one of several circumstances transpire, at which point it confronts the desecrators as an enhanced vengeful spirit (new) (arrives in 2-5 rounds to other rooms).
		* Taking either ring of Arden from the hidden compartments
		* Removing anything from the treasury (SL13-15)
		* Disturbing any of the relics of Arden (see SL13-22).
	* The spirit is not troubled by examination of The Red Book.

* GM Note: The leadership of the cult of Arden met here.
	* The corpse is that of the last pentarch of the Guardians, one Justus Faselton, killed by his mutinous men after he refused to let them abandon their posts.
	* The Red Book is a hint about the Labors of Arden (see SL13-10).

Justus, an enhanced vengeful spirit (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 1; MV 120’; HD 9; HP 60; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: STR drain. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire; reform in 1-6 hours so long as his bones remain unburied. Justus cannot be turned while he remains on SL13. 

### SL13-15: Treasury of the Defenders of Arden

* This small chamber housed the treasures accumulated by the cult of Arden.
	* Removing any of these valuables from the treasury causes Justus to transform into a vengeful spirit (see SL13-4).

Treasure:
* A 6’-tall blackware porcelain vase featuring scenes from the 4th Labor of Arden
	* Filled with 15,000 ancient silver pennies.
* A 5’-tall vase of ebony and ivory (5,000 gp).
* A pair of painted steel novelty andirons depicting Arden and Vul (250 gp).
* A battered bronze cauldron
	* Filled with 35,000 ancient copper bits.
* Sixteen 30-lb bars of smelted imperial gold piled into a pyramid (1,500 gp each).
* Two valuable ‘oriental’-style carpets
	* One depicts Arden’s 7th Labor and the other the Emperor bestowing arms on Arden and Vul (750 gp each).
* A large-sized Archontean chess set, containing 32 solid 2'-tall ivory pieces
	* The pieces represent Arden, Vul, other figures from the Twenty, and legionaries (750' gp each, but is heavy and bulky).
* A silk pouch containing four tokens of Arden and two rings of Arden (av items).
* A basket of woven reeds containing 150 small gemstones (10-20 gp each)
	* The basket is worth 1,500 gp to a collector of early imperial housewares.
* A wooden box holding 6 lb of incense (50 gp/lb)
* Ten doses of Gethite lotus powder (flora).

## Sub-Level 13: 16 - 39

### SL13-16: Barracks 

* The furnishings of this 15’-tall barracks are in relatively good shape.
	* Eight triple bunks made of iron-reinforced wood line the south wall.
	* Twenty chests are scattered among the bunks, their lids open and contents gone; only a few bits of decrepit linen and wool clothing remain, along with some personal items, including a razor, a mortar and pestle, a set of draughts made of wood, and a pack of playing cards made out of parchment.
	* To either side of the door are weapon and armor racks: two suits of ancient legionary armor (AC 4), six spears, three gladii, three war-hammers, and fifteen tower shields are still present and usable (one is a shield +1).
	* The corpses of three ancient legionaries lie in moldering lumps near the door. Their bodies display sword and spear wounds.

### SL13-17: Vandalized Guest Chamber

* A rather spartan guest chamber, with bed, wardrobe and writing table, utterly vandalized, with all furniture smashed to bits.
	* The corpse of an orange-robed priest of Thoth lies in the northwest corner, victim of multiple gladius thrusts.
	* 2 sets of robes of a priest of Thoth (20 gp, or 75 if mended); a gold holy symbol of Thoth (45 gp).

### SL13-18: Guest Chamber

* This guest chamber is intact, with dust-covered bed, wardrobe, and stand-up writing desk. There is nothing of value here. 

### SL13-19: Vandalized Guest Chamber

* The furnishings of this third guest chamber have also been destroyed.
	* Silk undergarments and several fine tunics strewn about the debris.
	* The surface of the smashed writing table has two objects pinned to it with daggers: a desiccated human finger and a scrap of parchment reading (Mithric): “the key is the Builder.”
		* GM Note: refers to the secret door to the treasury in SL13-14, in the stall under the carving of Phocion the Builder.  The mutinous legionaries thought it  referred to the statue of Phocion in the Hall of the Twenty. They tortured the chamber's occupant for more information before dragging her to area SL13-20.

### SL13-20: Hall of the Twenty

* This grand hall is 25’ tall and features beautiful rib vaulting and exquisite teak wainscoting (extending 10’ up the walls, 2000 gp in total). 
	* Twenty painted statues of the famous Archontean Worthies (see World of Archontos appendix) once stood in the chamber.  Nineteen remain, with one smashed.
		* Each statue is 8’ tall and is a composite stone (typically flesh is white marble or black obsidian, with granite clothing), examples of a master sculptor’s work.
			* Once painted in vibrant colors, faded but still evident.
			* 10,000 - 25,000 gp each, very heavy and difficult to move.
		* The nineteen remaining statues of the Twenty:
			* Vul the Sorcerer; Arden the Swordswoman; Licinia the Seer; Thrygga the Mighty; Plotinus Quartus Claudino; Yeth, He-Who-Sought-to-Bring-Law-to-Chaos; Horatius Interfector, sorcerer; Marius Tricotor, also called Marius Invictus; Crinius the Rector; Amalasuntha of Narsileon; Felix Minucius; Jixon of Archontos; Kalea the Theosoph; Pol, the Grinning Mage; Taticus and Thekla, the Twins; Ennius, the First Lord; Halduin the Citharist; and Terentius Borsa.
		* The smashed statue (was Phocion the Builder).
			* Hard to identify from the rubble.
			* On familiar with the Twenty might recognize a set of dividers in the rubble and conclude it was Phocion the Builder (see also 8-143), or 4d6 under INT for one with knowledge of ancient history.
		* The desiccated corpse of a woman lies near the smashed statue.
			* Dressed in a fine, blood-stained, silken tunic.  Missing one of the fingers of her left hand and has had her throat cut.
			* GM Note: this was an important visitor to the cult of Arden who had the misfortune to visit during the mutiny of the area’s legionary guards.
				* She was tortured in her chamber (see SL13-19) by the guards, who believed she knew where the cult’s treasury was kept; then she was dragged here, as the legionaries misinterpreted her comments about “the Key is the Builder” as referring to the statue here (instead of the stall in the chapter house).
		* 20’ up the south wall is a small hole, 3’ in diameter (easy to miss, unless explicitly looking at the ceiling and upper walls.).
			* It widens a bit into a 5’ tunnel leading south.

### SL13-21: Antechamber

* This antechamber is 15’ tall.
	* The pillar between the two entrances to SL13-22 is carved to resemble a 12’-tall Arden, in legionary attire and carrying her spear pressed against her body.
	* The corpses of 8 legionaries are scattered across the flagstones of the antechamber.
		* Their weapons and armor have mostly been destroyed by powerful blows.
		* 73 ancient silver pennies, 31 ancient gold solidi; 2 simple gold rings (15 gp each); three copper pectorals showing Arden the defender (5 gp each); a dagger +1.
		* These were mutinous Guardians, who met their fate at the hands of the stone guardians.
	* Two 9’-tall statues depicting Arden and Vul stand in the southwest and southeast corners.
		* Actually enhanced imperial stone guardians who rumble to life whenever anyone disturbs the artifacts of the reliquary (SL13-22).
			* Disturbing items from the reliquary also summons the vengeful spirit (new) of Justus the pentarch (SL13-14).

2 enhanced imperial stone guardians (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 9+3; HP 69, 64; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

### SL13-22: Reliquary of Arden the Defender

* This large hall houses the objects believed by the cult of Arden to be the true relics of the great heroine. 
	* The hall is completely sheathed with oak, including a striking barrel vaulting, floor-to-ceiling carved paneling, and interlocking flooring.
		* The paneling tells the story of the life of Arden (30,000 gp if somehow moved):
			* Her youth as a small girl living among the legionaries in the cantonments.
			* Her oath before the magistrates making her ‘sola’ (a woman legally free of male authority).
			* Her military career as spatharios, dekarch, kentarch and polemarch
			* Each of the twelve labors (see SL13-10)
			* Her triumphal procession through Archontos to meet the emperor.
	* Three stations in the hall contain the ‘relics’ of Arden.
		* Arden the Swordswoman (station left of the entrance): a 20’-long, 4’-tall stone block holds artifacts from Arden’s career in the legion of the XIV Scutarii.
			* A battered legionary’s tower shield +2; a short sword of sharpness; a badly-worn phlamoulon of the XIVth (bearing the broken slave-collar insignia of that legion); an actual broken slave collar; and a gold ceremonial polemarch’s helmet (500 gp, useless in combat).
				* The only item actually connected to Arden is the slave collar, which Arden struck from her mother’s neck when she earned enough solidi to make her mother a freedwoman.
			* A hidden compartment holds 3 tokens of Arden and a ring of Arden (av items).  Difficult to locate (1 in 8), must be pried open by force.
		* Arden and the Labors (station on the right) a 20’-long, 4’-tall stone block holds relics of the Twelve Labors (see SL13-10).
			* A necklace of bear claws strung on a silver chain (4th labor); a shell of a giant triton (250 gp; 7th labor); a circle of sardonyx, intaglioed with the image of a heron eating a fish (125 gp; 10th labor); a 3’-long tarnished brass trumpet (30 gp; 9th labor); two vials of dried troll blood (2nd labor); a pair of ogre mage tusks (3rd labor).
				* Only the bear-claw necklace is original to Arden, the necklace of the berserker (new).
		* Arden the Defender (station at the far end of the hall): a 10’-tall statue of Arden, shown as a weary soldier leaning on her spear. 
			* Mostly onyx, with ivory for face, hands, and other skin (30,000 gp).
			* It is draped with important personal objects (none ever actually possessed by the real Arden), removable without damaging the statue.
				* Helmet (guard cap, new)
				* Armor (imperial field plate +3, av items)
				* Spear (+4 life-stealing) (believed to be the Spear of Arden, but isn't).
				* A girdle of frost giant strength
				* A gold signet ring, featuring a stylized female legionary over the letter ‘A’ (375 gp).

* GM Note: Removing any relics from the reliquary causes the enhanced imperial stone guardians (SL13-21) to attack, and brings the spirit of Justus (SL13-14), now transformed into a vengeful spirit (new), flying to confront the desecrators within 2-5 rounds.

### SL13-23: Dekarchs’ Quarters

* Two dekarchs (junior officers) dwelled here.
	* Two beds, two wardrobes, two wooden chests and two racks for armor and weapons.
		* Equipment racks by the door contain a set of legionary armor (AC 4); a short sword +1; and several pairs of boots.
		* The corpse of one dekarch lies in his bed, killed while he slept.
		* Both wardrobes and chests have been ransacked, contents strewn about.
			* Among the debris (1 per turn of searching): a silver locket with a cameo of an Archontean woman (200 gp); a pair of jade earrings (100 gp); a high-quality box of writing styluses (50 gp); a dose of incense of attraction (new); a diptych of wax writing tablets with ivory covers carved with fantastic beasts (185 gp); and three 8” jesters carved of maple (35 gp).

### SL13-24: Lounge

* This 10' high chamber was undamaged during the mutiny.
	* Frescoes showing legionaries fighting, drinking, marching, and relaxing.
	* Ten simple wooden stools and four 4’-diameter wooden tables are scattered about. 
	* A bar in the southwest corner holds wooden cups and a 3 bottles of ancient Archontean brandy (85 gp each).
	* Three dart boards are mounted on the west wall.

### SL13-25: Barracks

* This chamber is 15’ tall, painted with flaking yellow paint.
	* Eight triple bunks made of iron-reinforced wood line the south wall.
	* Twenty chests are scattered among the bunks, their lids open, most contents gone.
		* A bottle of hair dye (dried out), a stone canister with fiery hot seeds in it, a crude set of Archontean chessmen carved of wood (30 sp), a whetstone, a flint, and a small teakwood box filled with narcotic powder (75 gp).
	* To either side of the door are weapon and armor racks.
		* 3 suits of ancient legionary armor (AC 4), 6 spears, a gladius, 2 javelins, and 14 tower shields are still present and usable.

### SL13-26: Pentarch’s Quarters

* The door to this chamber has been broken down, and its contents thoroughly vandalized.
	* There are even a few holes in the granite walls, as if someone were swinging heavy objects at the wall.
* A pastoral mural on the east wall shows an allegorical representation of good government.
	* Figures in the tunics of kritai, chartoularii and other imperial offices collect taxes, direct public works and issue judgments; the prosperity of their government is seen in verdant landscapes, with abundant harvests and ripe orchards.
	* Across is scrawled (Mithric): “May the pentarch suffer in the pits of the Abyss for his stubbornness! His honor has gotten us all killed!”
* Most of the furnishings (a bed, a wardrobe, a desk, some easy chairs, a low table, and several display racks) have been smashed to bits (vandals looking for valuables).
	* Among the debris of wood, linen, and silk:
		* A fragment of a painted teak folding screen: one panel – depicting a severe-looking, bald Archontean aristocrat – is in salvageable state (200 gp). 
		* An imperial rescript from Archon Pellas of Arden Vul to “Justus Faselton, pentarch of the Cohort of Arden”, dated AEP 1803. “Guard the sacred relics of Arden the Defender until your last breath. We are sending assistance and supplies. Good luck.” Scrawled across is the word “Lies!”
* Secret Door (north): difficult to find (1 in 8), opens by inserting the face of a ring of Arden (av items) into a depression on the west wall.

* GM Note: Justus, whose body lies at SL13-14, was the pentarch (commander) of a special cohort of legionaries tasked with guarding the shrine of Arden.
	* He tried to enforce the terms of the rescript sent him by Archon Pellas the Last during the final weeks of Archontean habitation in Arden Vul.
	* Half his men mutinied, and he and his dekarchs were slain. The mutineers could not get out through SL9-08, however, nor locate the secret door whose existence they suspected. Eventually they were killed by the imperial stone guardians.

### SL13-27: Narrow Stairs Leading Up to 6-144

* The 4’-wide staircase climbs steeply for 350’ before ending at a secret door (see 6-144 and 6-142).
	* Unless 6-142 has been thawed, the secret door to 6-142 can't be opened.
* The secret door from the stair to SL13-27 is obvious (1 in 3) and opens by releasing a latch near the ceiling.

### SL13-28: Unfinished Set Chamber

* Only the western portion of this chamber is worked, and there only roughly.
	* Hammered into the west wall is a sconce, from which hangs a silver holy symbol of Set (10 gp). 
	* The tunnel north (towards SL13-20) is hidden (as concealed door) behind a rockfall.
	* The other tunnels are narrow tubes, some 5’ in diameter.

### SL13-29: Stairs Leading Up to SL8-24

* The stairs, narrow and choked with cobwebs, lead up to SL8-24.

### SL13-30: Stalagmite Cave

* This cave is filled with stalagmites and stalactites, making movement slow and ponderous.
	* Ore gleams in the rock formations, suggesting possible iron or silver mining here.
* 15% per turn that a huldugritti (new) from SL13-34 visits this cave.
	* It will either attack (33%) or retreat to tell its comrades and plan an ambush (66%).

1 huldugritti (15%/turn): for stats, see SL13-34

### SL13-31: Damaged Cave

* Once filled with stalactites and stalagmites like SL-13-30, most of the rock formations have been recently shattered.
	* Among the rock debris are the corpses of two Priscian conversi (new), who scouted this area from 9-44 (via SL13-32) but were slain by the huldugritti (new) that inhabit these caves (see SL13-34).
	* The Priscians were killed by massive blows to the torso and head.
		* Most of their equipment is destroyed, save a dagger +1, short sword, sling; a pouch with 15 sardonyx gems (50 gp each), 73 gp; a potion of invisibility.
* 50% chance of attracting two of the huldugritti by spending more than 2 turns here.
	* If combat breaks out, the remainder of the huldugritti arrive in 1-3 rounds.

2 huldugritti (50%): for stats, see SL13-34

### SL13-32: Tunnel Leading Down to 9-44

* This tunnel corkscrews downward before reaching 9-44. 

### SL13-33: Tunnel Leading Up to 7-59

* Snaking upward at a steep pitch for 150’, this tunnel emerges at 7-59.

### SL13-34: Huldugritti

* The cave is 25’ tall and filled with spectacular stalagmites and stalactites.
	* Six huldugritti have been feeding on the rich ores left by the explosion that damaged SL13-36 and its environs in antiquity.
	* They are protective of the surrounding areas (SL13-28, SL13-30, SL13-31) and are unusually aggressive in seeking to expel intruders.
	* If alerted (see SL13-31) they may prepare an ambush here: lurking within the rock walls, only to emerge with fists swinging when the intruders present themselves.

6 huldugritti (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 0 or 2; MV 120’ or 60’; HD 8+8; HP 63, 61, 53, 51, 48, 44; #AT 2 (in stone form); Dmg 2-16/2-16; MR 25%. Special attacks: hurl boulders (2-8 HP each). Special defenses: meld with stone (cure 3-24 HP); assume spirit form; +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire, electricity, and mind-affecting spells.

### SL13-35: Water-Filled Cave

* Although the walls and ceiling of this area make it seem comparable to the neighboring caves, this area is actually a 60’-deep sinkhole filled with water.
	* Unwary explorers may turn the corner and step into the water. Those with heavy equipment may sink like a stone.
	* At the bottom of the sinkhole is the rotted corpse of a rudishva technician still in her orange jumpsuit, with a rust identity plaque.
		* She was killed in the blast that damaged area SL13-36, her body dragged here by animals, and gradually covered by the water of the hole.

### SL13-36: Damaged Plasteel Corridor and Door

* A section of the white plasteel corridor leading to the shuttle bay still exists.
	* The plasteel of the northern edge of the corridor is blackened, twisted, and scorched.
	* At the south end of the corridor is a rudishva iris door (dilates open to a silver or yellow identity plaque).
		* Two rudishva proximity-triggered anti-personnel mines (grey plasteel hexagons) are attached to the corridor walls 10’ from the door.
			* If previously encountered (cf. 5-118), they are instantly recognizable.
		* Approaching within 5’ detonates both, filling the corridor with shrapnel (each mine deals 5d8, save for half).
			* The mines have biometric scanners, simply rolling inert objects towards them will not trigger them.

### SL13-37: Rudishva Shuttle Bay

* The shuttle bay pod from the Beacon lies in this cave.
	* The rudishva expended substantial effort moving it from its initial crash site to this location, all in the hopes of someday activating one or both shuttles and returning to the stars. 
* The shuttle bay is a dome 25’ tall at its center point, built of white plasteel; all corners rounded in the usual rudishva style.
	* Bright LED lights turn on as soon as a life-form is detected within the bay.
	* The corpse of Lieutenant Svar-Loj, riddled with projectile holes, lies just inside the door from SL13-36.
	* It is guarded by a rudishva battle robot (new).
		* It's programming has failed slightly; it attacks instantly and without hesitation all those who enter the shuttle bay.
	* The bay contains two shuttles (SL13-37a and SL13-37b) plus a maze of high-technology equipment.
	* Huge plasteel airlock doors lie directly to the south of the operative shuttle.
		* They can be opened from the consoles amid the machinery of the shuttle bay, or from the pilot’s chair in the shuttle (SL13-37B).
			* It takes 1-2 hours of study and a successful roll of 4d6 under INT to figure out how to open the airlock doors.

Machinery and Equipment
* The east side of the bay is loaded with impressive and complicated machinery, most connected via thick cables to outlets in the floor of the bay.
	* Three centrifuges and a high-heat centrifuge
	* Four massive cylinders of rocket fuel
	* Several console computers
	* A refrigerated storage unit
	* An impressive amount of glass-steel chemical equipment
	* A dozen oval chemical storage ‘eggs’ (150 lb of crushed arcanum (new), 10 lb of rare minerals distilled from the mud flats of SL9, and a variety of other chemicals).
* Several technological items are stacked alongside.
	* A rudishva jet ski; a rudishva hover sled; 8 greater rudishva power supplies; a GnuCoder 3000 data recorder; and a GnuCoder 5000 Full-Immersion Sensory Experience (tech).

* The equipment can be used to create fuel powerful enough for the operative shuttle's (SL13-37b) jury-rigged star drive.
	* It is difficult to operate without thorough comprehension of the concepts of advanced science.  Even the most intelligent ‘ordinary’ fantasy humans or humanoids are unlikely to be able to use the equipment with facility. 
	* The data crystals in 9-94 (Solutions to the Propulsion Problem) and SL9-48 (Creating D-3He Reactions from Native Minerals) might permit highly intelligent characters to use the centrifuges and other equipment to make fuel for another 3-6 jumps.
	* Enough pre-made fuel to make a single FTL jump to an inhabited interstellar location may be found in 9-96.

1 rudishva battle robot (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’ flying (Class A); HD 8; HP 55; #AT 4; Dmg 3-9/3-9/3-12/3-18 (laser/laser/explosive pellet/gauss gun). Special attacks: attacks and saves as a 10th-level fighter; gauss gun strikes all targets within range each round. Special defenses: immune to fire, cold, electricity, and poison; immune to mind-affecting spells. Special: 56 explosive pellets remain.
* This battle robot’s programming has failed slightly. Possession of a plastic rudishva identity plaque or a rudishva command bracelet (new) does not render the bearer immune from the robot; it cannot be controlled or quieted.
* This robot has extra ammunition, allowing its gauss gun to fire for ten rounds instead of the usual five.

##### SL13-37a: Dismantled Shuttle

* This shuttle (designated LOAV-290) has been cannibalized for parts to enable the other shuttle to be ready to fly (see SL13-37B).
	* The airlock has been removed, and access to the interior is untrammeled.
	* The piloting and navigational stations are intact, but all of the propulsion systems (including fuel tanks) have been ripped out, as well as a lot of wiring and microchips.
	* Even non-technological explorers can see that this vehicle is not usable.
	* The central crew area is fairly comfortable, and could be used as a campsite.

##### SL13-37b: Intact Shuttle

* The second shuttle faces the airlock doors and is fully intact.
	* Its formal designation in the RISEA (Rudishva Interstellar Exploration Agency) is LOAV-291, for Low-Occupancy Atmospheric Vehicle (or shuttle).
		* The LOAV series was designed to resemble a creature from rudishva mythology, the Chamundi, which is superficially similar to an oriental dragon.
	* It is 20’ wide, 50’ long and 20’ tall, with plasteel decorations along the roof that resemble the Chamundi’s horns and flowing whiskers, with the viewscreen in the place of the creature’s gritted teeth.  It is painted in vibrant colors.
	* It has wings for use in atmospheric flying, retractable for deep space flight and  maneuvering in tight spaces (e.g. the shuttle bay).

Shuttle Layout
* Access is via the square-ish airlock at the rear of the shuttle (opens to a pale green, pink, orange, silver or yellow identity plaque).
* Beyond the airlock, a narrow 10’-long and 5’-wide corridor leads to the two crew areas.
	* Engineering and Science Station (4 crew seats)
		* This section has been clearly modified, most of the consoles ripped out and new equipment jury-rigged into the area.
			* One new component is a set of two large fuel tanks; labeled with the Rudishva glyphs for ‘star’ and ‘fuel.’
			* A second new component is a pair of cylindrical holes for canisters to be inserted: the glyphs beneath read ‘orange,’ ‘rock,’ and ‘compound’.
			* The third new component is a 5’ cylinder with a cylindrical slot at one end.
	* Astrogation and Command Section (6 crew stations: Pilot’s Chair, Communications Station, 2 Astrogation Stations, 2 Tactical Systems Stations)
		* Each station has a console, with slides, knobs, buttons, and viewscreens.
		* The pilot’s seat also has slots to receive astrogation crystals.
		* Using the stations is difficult, but some trial by error is likely to produce results.
			* It takes 6-8 hours of experimentation to learn the systems, with a cumulative 1% chance per hour of causing a fatal systems overload,  destroying the shuttle in a burst of energy (60d6 damage within the bay).
			* Reading and mastering the following data crystal "The Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven: Technical Specifications of this Yort-Class Exploration Vessel" (see 9-90 and SL12-28) makes this much easier. 
			* The AI AKL-600 (Akla-Chah) can explain the process to ready the shuttle for interstellar travel (see SL14-13).  In return, Akla-Chah requests that PCs download her personality and memory into a large crystal and bring her with them on the shuttle.

Activating the Shuttle
* To fly the shuttle out of the cliff face and into the stars, the following checklist must be completed. 
1. A drive rod from the main engine room (7-143) must be inserted into the cylindrical slot in the equipment in the engineering station of the shuttle.
2. Appropriate fuel must be added to the fuel tanks in the shuttle (available in the tanks in the shuttle bay).
3. Canisters of the special formula of arcanum-enriched deuterium must be placed in the cylindrical holes in the shuttle’s engineering area.
	* Enough of to allow for one FTL jump is found in area 9-96.  To make more than one jump, more of the formula must be synthesized (see instructions at SL13-37).
4. One or more astrogation crystals (from SL14-10) must be inserted into the receptacles in the astrogation station.
5. The inner door to the airlock must be opened (SL13-39), either from the cockpit of the shuttle or from the machinery.
6. The shuttle’s wings must be retracted so it can proceed down the runway.

Locations to Which the LOAV May Fly
* This product does not detail the mechanics of interstellar travel or the specifics of interstellar locations. The GM should select appropriate rules for space travel and design his/her own worlds and/or space stations. 

### SL13-38: Rudishva Teleporter

* The corridor is sheathed in spotless white marble and lacks right angles and ends in three semi-circular niches.
	* The western niche contains a 5’-diameter silvery disc inset in the floor, with a 10”x10” square of the same material affixed to the wall.
		* The silvery square has a rune etched into the silvery material. The rudishva built these niches to be part of their teleportation network. To activate it, one stands on a silvery circle and touches the adjacent silvery square; teleportation to the appropriate location is instantaneous. 
		* T20: access to 9-97
	* The other two niches are empty.

### SL13-39: Airlock and Runway

* The rudishva built this area in the anticipation that they would eventually be able to refit the shuttle for interstellar travel.
	* The airlock door leading to SL13-38 is a massive, dilating piece of reinforced plasteel.
	* It leads to a ‘runway’ 30’ wide and 30’ tall, also of reinforced plasteel.
	* The southern door leading to the exterior of Arden Vul was concealed behind the natural rock face.
		* The Archonteans never discovered the runway or its exit, and built the colossus of Arden the Defender over the exit.
		* As the shuttle accelerates down the runway, explosive charges will automatically detonate at the southern end, blowing the rock shield outward, allowing the shuttle to swoop out into the valley.
		* The exit is located about 100’ above the floor of the valley, roughly at the ankles of the colossus.
