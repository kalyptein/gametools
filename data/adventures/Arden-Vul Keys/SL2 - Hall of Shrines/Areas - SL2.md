## Overview

This sub-level comprises two distinct regions. The first, the Hall of Shrines, is one of the most potent and secret constructions of the priests of Thoth from the Archontean period of Arden Vul. The Hall is of polished marble and granite, and features the static, busy artistic program of the cult of Thoth. The shrines that radiate from the Hall are quite potent - for good or for ill - and the GM is advised to consider limiting access to them; a good rule of thumb is that Thoth only allows one shrine to be ‘open’ at a time. The other part of the sub-level contains a suite of chambers that were originally part of the Beacon. These areas are thus rudishva in feel and appearance, with rounded corners and metallic surfaces.

General Construction
* Rudishva areas: SL2-2, SL2-3
* Archontean areas: SL2-1

Access and Egress 
* To Level 2: stairs at SL2-1, leading to 2-45
* To Level 6: elevator at SL2-3, leading down to 6-95A
* To Level 9: tunnel at SL2-6, leading down to 9-131
* To various locations: Thothian teleportation ring at SL2-1
* To the Astral and/or Ethereal Planes: gates at SL2-1H


## Areas

#### SL2-1: Hall of Shrines

* A set of broad stairs leading up 75’ from 2-45 provides the traditional route to this site.
* A grand hall, with a tall ceiling (30’), all clad in gleaming white marble.
	* Two imposing rows of 8’-tall statues that face outwards, toward the walls
		* 28 plinths, but only 22 still occupied and bearing the names of their subjects, carved in Mithric on the plinth.
		* The names include many heroes of old -- warriors, sorcerers, priests, and lords -- Worthies of the Archontean Empire (e.g., Crinius the Rector, Amalasuntha of Narsileon, Felix Minucius, Jixon of Archontos, Kalea the Theosoph, etc).
		* They may be called to activate and attack as special stone golems. If destroyed, the name on its plinth is erased.
	* Rounded archways on each long wall lead to shrines, each devoted to a particular incarnation of Thoth, and decorated with vibrantly colored bas-reliefs representing the appropriate virtue or theme.
		* Roll 1d8 to determine which shrine is available on a given visit to the hall.  Once determined, it is ‘open’ through the lunar month.
		* The other seven will be sealed with walls of divine force, except SL2-1H, which is malfunctioning due to damage.
* At the south end, in a semi-circular niche, is a colossal statue of Thoth, 5' wide and 15' high, made of black basalt with a white marble ibis-head with lapis beak.
	* Enormous yellow topaz gem eyes (500 gp each) and lapis beak (500 gp).
		* Any effort to desecrate the statue rouses all remaining stone golems to attack, ensures the permanent enmity of Thoth, and automatic failure in any shrines.
	* From the ibis’s beak drifts a spiral of light orange vapor, the Pneuma of Champions.  It smells vaguely of ripe citrus and has magical effects (see below).
	* Verses in 2’-tall, gold-filled letters are carved into the wall on either side of Thoth (see below).
	* Along the plinth is series of icons of lunar phases, one for each day.
		* The current phase shimmers, moving along the series day by day.  This marks the time frame for the current shrine to be open (a new one opens when the series starts, with the full moon)
* In the northwest corner is a Thothian teleportation ring (address: YE-BL-RE-GR-BK-WH). 
	* No glass activation squares are present.
* Corpses of at six adventurers are strewn throughout the room, along with several piles of broken granite.
	* On the dead adventurers: 
	* 256 gp, 379 sp, 243 cp; 
	* two suits of chain mail; 
	* a ranseur +1; 
	* a battle axe +1; 
	* warrior in 1F
		* a suit of banded mail; a shield +2; 
		* a holy symbol of Thoth, 
	* two long swords; 
	* thief 1: a sling +2, with 20 bullets, 
	* bones in 1G: a scroll with four illusionist spells (dispel exhaustion, brain full of small spiders, brain full of large spiders, and warding chain of glyphs), a potion of gaseous form; and a potion of fly.

Golden Verses (beside the statue of Thoth)
* The inscription to the east of the statue reads:
	* Soft exhalations
	* Drift from the beak,
	* As the Lord’s Pneuma
	* Molds the champion
* The inscription to the western of the statue:
	* The Champion’s virtue
	* Is revealed in humility and wisdom,
	* While the lies of the proud
	* Find reward in self-knowing

The Pneuma of Champions
* The Pneuma is strongly narcotic.  If inhaled, it causes a number of effects.
	* Contemplation (1d6 rounds): stand still and contemplates the mysteries of Thoth.
	* Glow (~1 hour): the user’s head is wreathed in an orange, translucent nimbus and they experience a general glow of excellence and well-being.
	* Wisdom (1 day): WIS +4, INT +4
	* Weakness (1 day): STR -4, CON -4
	* Openness to Thoth (1d6 hours): attempts to contact Thoth (as a cleric, through spells, or via the shrines) are more likely to succeed.

21 stone golems: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 14; HP 60(x21); #AT 1; Dmg 3-24. Special attacks: slow once every other round. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to most magic.


##### The Shrines

* At the end of each sub-chamber chamber is a shrine reflecting the relevant incarnation.
	* Before each shrine is a circle of blue granite.
	* Above each shrine to Thoth is a gold-filled inscription in Mithric.
	* If a postulant stands within, the shrine is activated.
* The Voice of Thoth
	* In many of the shrines, postulants will hear the voice of Thoth, which is comprehensible to all.
* Attempts
	* An individual may experience negative effects many times, but once they gain the benefit once, the shrine is closed to them.

##### SL2-1A: Thoth the Arbitrator of Disputes

* Decorations: scenes of men judging a wide variety of creatures.
* At the end of the chamber stands a 4’-tall marble table, on which sits a set of platinum scales (with weights nearby).
	* One who has undergone the test may remove the scales (4,650 gp and enchanted).
		* Fail: the scales always weigh incorrectly and cannot be balanced; using them makes the PC liable to accusations of using false measures.
		* Pass: the scales are perfectly balanced, and for you give an accurate gp value of any gem, jewelry, or small object placed upon them. 
	* For others, they seem immovably fixed to the table.
	* If taken, a new pair appears when the shrine is next available (after a month).
* Above the table, the wall is carved with both an inscription and a trio of 3’-tall polychromed figures in high relief.
	* An ibis-headed man (Thoth) stands between a hawk-headed man (Horus) and a red-headed man (Set) and wraps a cord around the clasped hands of Set and Horus (representing concord between the two enemies).
* Inscription
	* The Champion’s Wisdom Ensures Peace 
* How the Shrine Works
	* One activating the shrine is frozen briefly in time, communing with Thoth who telepathically asks three questions of the postulant.  After each answer is registered, the ibis relief booms so that all can hear: “Thoth Hears!”.
	* Once all three questions have been answered, the ibis states “Now Thoth shall Judge.”  The postulant rolls 3d6 (equal or under Wisdom passes, higher fails).
		* The answers given modify the roll (among the sample answers, the "best" is marked with a \*).  Dodgy but not terrible answers give a +1.
	* Questions
		* A wise man walks with whom?
			* A. The wise* (-2)
			* B. The strong (+2)
			* C. Himself (+0)
		* In judging, a just judge seeks what?
			* A. To discover right (-1)
			* B. To apply the letter of the law (+1)
			* C. To bring harmony to the parties* (-2)
		* Law is always trumped by what?
			* A. Nothing (+0)
			* B. Informal agreement* (-2)
			* C. Might (+2)
	* Fail (d6)
		* 1) -1 WIS (permanent)
		* 2) Permanent -4 Reaction Roll to be applied to any attempt by the PC to persuade anyone of anything
		* 3) Buying or selling goods is affected by -25% (that is, prices are 25% higher when buying  and 25% lower when selling); lasts 1 year
		* 4) PC is 50% more likely to be found guilty of a crime of which he/she is formally accused in * a legal setting; permanent
		* 5-6) 2-4 stone golems activate and attack
	* Pass (d6)
		* 1) +1 WIS (permanent)
		* 2) +4 reaction roll in any formal legal setting (permanent)
		* 3) May summon this avatar of Thoth once in order to consult on the wisdom of a particular decision or action, or to intercede in a difficult set of negotiations. The avatar’s advice will be highly useful, even decisive, but it will not engage in combat
		* 4) PC gets 25% better prices for a year

##### SL2-1B: Thoth the Magician

* Decorations: frescoes showing arcane symbols, formulae, and objects (wands, librams, etc.).
* At the western end is a basalt table on which sit two wands, one carved out of simple oak with a few arcane glyphs and the other a piece of ivory chased with silver and gold. 
* Above the table is carved an inscription and a flying ibis with open beak, from which a long, twisting scroll descends to the hands of two sorcerers. The scene represents Thoth as the font of magic.
* Inscription
	* The Champion Taps the Arcane 
* How the Shrine Works
	* A booming voice which intones “Choose!” Both wands glow with an orange light until the postulant selects one (at which point the other returns to inert status).
		* Inert wands can be taken and used as arcane foci (50 gp).
		* Thoth replaces any missing wands within a month.
	* Regardless of which is chosen, the postulant rolls 3d6 under Intelligence.
		* Fail: the chosen wand is cursed.  Roll a the Wooden Wand; the postulant is convinced that is what the wand does, but it is actually a cursed wand of alarms (if wooden) or cursed wand of life-stealing (if ivory).
		* Pass: roll a wand type (d6); it has 40 charges.  It's nature and charges are instinctively known to the wielder (who is the only one who can use it, but can do so even if not normally able to use wands).
			* 1) Wonder (wood) or Illumination (ivory)
			* 2) Lightning (wood) or Magic Detection (ivory)
			* 3) Polymorph (wood) or Metal and Mineral Detection (ivory)
			* 4) fire (wood) or Secret Door and Trap Detection (ivory)
			* 5) Negation (wood) or Enemy Detection (ivory)
			* 6) Conjuration (wood) or Size Alteration (ivory)
* Modifiers
	* Postulant is a magic user: -2
	* Postulant is an illusionist: -1
	* Postulant is any other class: +2
	* Postulant is a follower of Thoth: -2
	* Postulant is a follower of Set: +2
	* Postulant has correctly and orally identified Thoth as the origin of magic: -1

##### SL2-1C: Thoth the Scribe

* Decorations: scores of scribes laboring to copy scrolls and codices.
* At the western end is a solid ivory table on which rests the Book of Thoth, an ebony inkpot, and an ibis-feather pen.
	* The Book of Thoth is an enormous codex, 3’x5’, with green leather covers and ivory plates for folios (see Arden Vul books).  Trying to read it without being under the influence of Pneuma inflicts a failed "Read" outcome.
* Above the table are carved an inscription and a fresco of baboon-headed Thoth handing scrolls to genuflecting humans.
* Inscription
	* The Champion Transfers Knowledge
* How the Shrine Works
	* The postulant must have breathed in the pneuma of Thoth (SL2-1).  A booming voice intones “Will you read or write?”
	* If the postulant says or thinks ‘read,’ the Book of Thoth opens to one of the pages determined on the table below.
		* Roll 3d6 under Intelligence to comprehend the cosmic secrets.
			* Fail: -1 Intelligence, then suffer confusion for 1 day.  Can never benefit from this shrine.
			* Pass (d6): +1 Intelligence (1), +1 Wisdom (2), permanent Comprehend Languages as the spell (3), gain a once per day 1st-level spell-like ability (4), gain Astral Spell as a once-per-week spell-like ability (5), gain a level or 10,000 xp, whichever is more (6).
	* If the postulant speaks or thinks ‘write,’ the ibis-feather pen floats to his hand, and the Book of Thoth opens to a blank page.
		* The postulant senses that they must offer up knowledge to Thoth, knowing that what they give will be gone from them forever.  Can give any number of things.
			* Base % (assuming you given anything): 20%
			* Spells: lose the spell from your list.  +(spell level x 10)%
			* Secrets or Knowledge: +(character level x 10)%
			* Roll %
				* Fail: the voice says "It is already known."  No harm, but no retries at this shrine either.
				* Pass: gain 1 benefit as new knowledge and memories flow into the place where old was given up.
					* Gain a knowledge-based class ability from another class (a thief skill, a fighter mastery), but not casting.
					* Add the spell list of another class to your own (mage can now cast cleric spells, etc).
						* Same number of spell slots.  Can use the best spell level from among the options.  Can use scrolls.  Casters must invent the spells through research / training, or gain from scrolls.
					* Mages (generalist or specialist) can gain the benefit of specialization in a school, with no drawbacks.
					* A specialist mage can lose their denied schools.

##### SL2-1D: Thoth the Judge of the Dead

* Decorations: the south wall depicts a line of many souls of various social classes progressing towards a set of scales. The north wall shows an enormous fresco of the scales, behind which crouch Thoth-as-baboon and Maat.
	* On one scale is a human heart, while on the other is an ibis feather. Five humans are lined up to be judged - a beggar, a great lady, a pudgy priest, a sorcerer, and a warrior.
* At the western end is a plain stone table on which stands a 3’-tall set of bronze scales. To one side lies a white ibis feather made of ivory; to the other side lie two apple-sized human hearts carved out of red garnet; one with a white painting of an ibis feather on it; one with a black spiral.
* Inscription
	* With Wisdom the Champion Judges
* How the Shrine Works
	* The voice of Thoth booms forth: “Thou must judge so that thou may be judged!”.  In turn, three of the judgement candidates on the wall animate and makes a short statement about the conduct of its life.  The postulant must place one of the two garnet hearts and the feather of Maat onto the scales.
		* Heart with a feather: the soul is without serious sin and thus worthy of joining the afterlife.
		* Heart with spiral: the soul does not merit the afterlife and is devoured by Ammit.
	* If all 3 judgements are right in Thoth's eyes, pass.  If all are wrong, fail.  If mixed, roll 3d6 under Wisdom, -2 if 2-of-3 are right, and +2 if 1-of-3 are right.
		* Thoth is a god of law, justice and equanimity; the ‘correct’ judgment is  a reflection of the absence of violent emotion, pride, or chaotic impulses. 
		* Fail: the voice of Thoth booms forth: “You lack the wisdom to judge justly.” -1 Wisdom and 3 stone golems animate and attack.
		* Pass: the voice of Thoth booms with satisfaction: “Wisdom is indeed the prerequisite for Judgment.” +1 Wisdom.
	* Either way, the postulant may take the hearts (500 gp each) and feather (200 gp).
		* Pass: the feather transforms into a Feather of Maat.

The Souls (d10, d8, d6 to avoid repeats within the soul type)
* 1) Wild-eyed beggar in tattered clothes (Maat)
	* My wife died, and I lost my job when I broke my leg. I have begged because I have nothing else to do. I am grateful for the charity showed to me by all.
* 2) Wild-eyed beggar in tattered clothes
	* I never deserved poverty, as I have had nothing but bad luck. My wife died and I hurt my leg working for an unjust overseer. In the afterlife I will become equal to those who have sprinkled a few coins on me.
* 3) Beautiful lady in glittering jewels and gown (Maat)
	* The gods blessed me with beauty and wealth. I have never listened to the insinuations of the envious, but rather have acted with equanimity towards all, offering pain where it is due and reward where it is due. I have exercised my rightful authority justly.
* 4) Beautiful lady in glittering jewels and gown (Sin)
	* The gods blessed me with beauty and wealth. Those who have envied my gifts cannot be trusted; my righteous anger has brushed them aside, and I have ferreted out their dens of iniquity. I act righteously in all matters.
* 5) Pudgy priest in soiled robes (Sin)
	* Curses on Set! It is the fault of the loathsome deceiver that I have been foiled in my efforts to lead a blameless life. To repay his deceit I have slain his cattle and will feast on them with my paramour.
* 6) Pudgy priest in soiled robes (Maat)
	* The ways of the Gods are unfathomable. I have sought only to follow the path of righteousness. I have rebuffed the amorous, distributed their gifts to the poor, and embraced the path of moderation. While I have erred, it has been accidental and not intentional.
* 7) Haughty sorcerer brandishing a wand (Maat)
	* With my mighty magic I have explored every facet of the universe. I have torn down, and I have built up. I have sought knowledge, and shared it with the learned. My life reflects the power of magic.
* 8) Haughty sorcerer brandishing a wand (Sin)
	* Magic has made me feared. My anger has wrought devastation on those who would dare to challenge me. My life reflects the triumph of magical power.
* 9) Stern warrior in imperial field plate (Maat)
	* Over the course of a dozen campaigns I have fought tirelessly with dripping blade to defend the Empire. I have slain and watched my comrades be slain. I seek rest.
* 10) Stern warrior in imperial field plate (Sin)
	* Brought unwilling to the army, I proved an eager disciple, reveling in the battle lust and the cleansing emotions wrought by slaughter. Promoted to Polemarch, I always sought the lead in battle, throwing my troops into the fray and following with shrieking war cry. Glory is my reward.

##### SL2-1E: Thoth the Self-Begotten

* Decorations: frescos of dozens of images of objects and incarnations associated with Thoth: ibis-headed men, ibises, baboons, apes, scroll full of writing, a sorcerer’s staff, a star constellation, a set of scales, the feather of Maat, an egg, etc.
* At the east end is a stone table sits beneath the inscription.
* On the table are ten miniature-sized (3” tall) objects representing each of the symbols just mentioned; each is made from a different precious material (gold, silver, ivory, ebony, gems, etc.).
* Inscription
	* The Champion’s Wisdom Knows Whence it Arrives
* How the Shrine Works
	* The voice of Thoth booms forth, asking two questions, after which roll 3d6 under Intelligence.
		* First Question: Whence Lord Thoth?
			* From Himself -5
			* From nothing -5
			* He is always -5
			* An egg +1
			* An ibis +1
			* A baboon +3
			* Any other answer +5
		* Second Question: What are the offspring of Lord Thoth?
			* He has none -3
			* All things -1
			* Writing -1
			* Magic/spells -1
			* The (other) Gods 0
			* Baboons 0
			* Ibises 0
			* Humans +2
			* Any other answer +1 to +3 
		* Fail: the voice intones: “You lack wisdom. Learn it, lest you be cursed! And now… choose your reward!”  The postulant can take object(s) from the table, but suffers a  curse for each.  If they refrain, they are not cursed.  Curses are permanent until dispelled by a 12th-level cleric.
		* Pass: the voice of Thoth intones: “Your wisdom is manifest! Choose your reward!”.  The postulant may take one of the objects, which sparkle invitingly, gaining its blessing.  Greedily taking extra objects inflicts their curses.
			* If they say something like “I choose wisdom”, the objects disappear and they gain +1 Wisdom and the blessings of two objects (as judged by the DM which they would most prefer).

Objects

##### SL2-1F: Thoth the Astronomer

First time it will be Scorpion (opposed by Bull)

* Decorations: frescos of the traditional zodiacal symbols, six on the south wall, six on the north wall.
	* South Wall (from east to west) Ram, Bull, Twins, Crab, Lion, and Maiden
	* North Wall (from east to west) Scales, Scorpion, Archer, Goat (w/ fish-tail), Water-Bearer, and Fish.
* At the east end of the shrine is a complex apparatus of arcs, circles and gears, all apparently made of gold. Twenty orbs made of various gemstones stud the apparatus.
* Inscription
	* The Champion’s Wisdom Brings Order to the Stars
* How the Shrine Works
	* When activated, the apparatus spins and gyrates for 1 round, then stops with the gemstones in the arrangement of one of the twelve zodiacal signs (1d12 for which).
		* Astronomic lore, player recognition, or rolling 3d6 under Intelligence can recognize what the pattern is.
	* The voice of Thoth booms forth “The stars must be aligned, and the signs opposed. Else chaos reigns!”  The wall fresco of that sign slowly comes to life, peeling from the wall and expanding into a full-sized being over 3 rounds.; 
	* The apparatus can be manipulated to move the gems, and must moved to form the opposing zodiacal sign (might require 3d6 under Intelligence, unless postulant has astronomical knowledge).  The pairs are: Ram - Scales, Bull - Scorpion, Twins - Archer, Crab - Goat, Lion - Water-Bearer, Maiden - Fish (each pair across from each other on the north and south wall frescos).
		* Pass: if done before the 3 rounds are up, the opposing sign also comes to life.  They two fight to mutual destruction.  The postulant gains +1 Wisdom and the treasures of the two signs.
		* Fail: the animated sign attacks the postulant, pursuing until one of them is dead.  Completing the opposing sign (perhaps guarded by allies) counts as a Pass.  Slaying the sign does yield its treasure.

Animated Zodiac Signs
* 1) Ram: An enormous white-and-red bighorn sheep, with fire-red, glowing eyes and a pair of sharp, golden horns
	* Stats: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8+8; HP 60; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12 (horn); MR 20%. Special defenses: immune to fire.  Vulnerability: Takes double damage from ice or water; is easily distracted by images of another ram/sheep (e.g., by an illusion, or even a mirror)
	* Treasure: 2 golden horns, each worth 500 gp. Excellent potential as musical instruments.
* 2) Bull: A huge, 5’-tall snow-white bull, with black ‘stockings’ markings on its feet, a black head, and black tail. Its eyes are limpid, grey and featureless. Its horns are ivory, carved with scenes of commerce presided over by bulls; blue dye highlights the carvings.
	* Stats: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8+8; HP 60; #AT 1; Dmg 5-16 (head-butt); MR 20%. Special attacks: breath weapon (slow, 2/day). Special defenses: immune to alteration magic.  Vulnerability: Waving the color red before the Bull causes it to attack wildly at -3 to hit; double damage from electricity
	* Treasure: 2 carved ivory horns, each 500 gp in value; potential as drinking horns.
* 3) Twins: Two muscular young men in loincloths, bearing polished wooden clubs. A 5’-long silver chain runs from a bracelet on one twin’s left hand to a bracelet on the other’s right hand. The Twins are agile and strong, but strangely anonymous; this is particularly of their faces, whose features are bland, unwrinkled, and disconcerting.
	* Stats: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8+8; HP 60; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12 (club); MR 20%. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd so long as joined by the chain; immune to cold, electricity, fire, and water damage.  Vulnerability: Breaking the chain linking the twins inflicts 50% of remaining HP damage, and large tears of blood start welling from the eyes of each. Chain: AC 0; HP 18.
	* Treasure: The red tears may be collected at the end of combat. There will be 2 tears for each round of combat after the chain is broken. Tears of the Twins (see new magic items) are small rubies worth 500 gp each; if swallowed, allow temporary regeneration of 2 HP/rd for 2 turns.
	* Note: Each individual twin has no fixed amount of HP. Regardless of how much one twin ‘takes’, the twins are only defeated once the pair has taken 60 HP, whether that damage is inflicted on one twin or is divided among the two.
* 4) Crab: A huge crab, with midnight black shell and pure white eyes.
	* Stats: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8+8; HP 60; #AT 2; Dmg 3-12/3-12; MR 20%. Special defenses: immune to cold and water damage.  Vulnerability: Takes double damage from fire.
	* Treasure: Eyes are pearls worth 250 gp each; if 450 gp is expended a good armorer could transform the chitinous shell into a shield +2, +3 versus cold.
* 5) Lion: An 8’-long, tawny gold lion with amber eyes
	* Stats: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8+8; HP 60; #AT 3; Dmg 1-8/1-8/2-8 (claw/claw/bite); MR 20%. Special attacks: stunning roar, 2/day (save vs. petrification or be stunned for 1-3 rounds). Special defenses: immune to fire.  Vulnerability: Susceptible to illusion (-3 to saves); double damage from arrows.
	* Treasure: Hide may be made into leather armor +2, with +2 to saves vs fire attacks; doing so costs 450 gp in materials and labor.
* 6) Maiden: A beautiful girl with long dreadlocks, chiseled facial features, and coal-black eyes. She wears a light-blue, diaphanous gown and a golden circlet from which dangle 20 enormous pearls on golden chains. 
	* Stats: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8+8; HP 60 each; #AT 1; Dmg special; MR 75%. Special attacks: touch petrifies if save is failed (petrification starts at point of touch and only spreads to cover the whole body in 2-4 rounds); charm person through her song.
	* Vulnerability: Has no magic resistance against any spell that affects the mind directly (e.g. suggestion, confusion, feeblemind).
	* Treasure: Golden circlet of pearls (see new magic items)
* 7) Scales: A pair of armored dwarfs, each holding a heavy weight on a short chain in each hand. Their eyes are blank, and their expressions featureless.
	* Stats: 2 dwarfs: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8+8; HP 30, 30; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 20%. Special attacks: they are +2 to hit when swinging the weighted chains as a flail. Special defenses: any hit to either dwarf is shared between the two (halve the damage total and apply half to each); immunity to fire.  Vulnerability: Any display of gold coins or gems will act as confusion spell
	* Treasure: Once the dwarfs are dead, the weights crack open. One contains a set of mithril scales, the other three contain sets of weights weighing a combined 100 lb. These weights are solid gold and can be sold for 3,000 gp. As a set, though, the scales can be used to determine almost accurate (+/- 5%) values of any object placed in the scales. 
* 8) Scorpion: A giant scorpion made of segmented, multi-colored alabaster. Its eyes are black jet gems.

##### SL2-1G: Thoth the Resurrector 

* Decorations: frescoes depict ibis-headed Thoth striding among brightly-painted sarcophagi, touching them with a white ibis feather. In half the images, the sarcophagi are opening, and the dead are rising.
* At the east end is an 8’ statue of an ibis of pure white marble, with a black basalt beak and blue sapphire eyes. One of the feathers extrudes from the statue and appears to be made of solid gold.  On a stone table before the statue is a mummified body.
* Inscription
	* The Wise Champion Raises the Dead
* How the Shrine Works
	* The postulant must be under the effects of Pneuma.  They behold labyrinthine paths through the Land of Reeds, navigating them to find the soul of the deceased.  Roll 3d6 under Wisdom, either finding the soul or giving up in despair.
		* Fail: the mummy crumbles to dust, leaving behind the feather, a cheap 25 gp copper curio.  The postulant ages, losing half their natural lifespan (full lifespan, not remaining; e.g ~35 years for humans).
		* Pass: the mummy rises, shedding wrappings to reveal a healthy person, then  fades away, replaced by the golden feather.  It is enchanted (touched to a victim and expended to raise dead or remove other states such as petrification, without any side-effects.  The subject is restored to perfect health.  The feather turns to dust).

##### SL2-1H: Thoth the Timeless (or, Thoth, the Lord of Time)

* A small collapse in the southeast corner has revealed a narrow, cramped tunnel to SL2-2.

* Decorations: the south wall is painted flat grey; amid which flit vaguely humanoid shapes in shapeless white. A few silver cords snake through the grey. The north wall features a grey mist within which are dim forms - bipedal, oval demi-planes, and a swirling vortex.
* Inscription
	* The Wisdom of the Champion Conquers Time
* How the Shrine Works
	* The postulant must have breathed in the pneuma of Thoth (SL2-1).  They enter a trance and attempt to commune with Thoth across space and time. After 1d6 Turns, roll 3d6 under Wisdom.
		* Fail: every time the postulant sleeps, there is a 50% chance they don't awaken as normal, but sleep another 8 hours, then roll again.  Their mind is adrift, dreaming of strange worlds.
		* Pass: a Scroll of Thoth's Gate appears on the shrine (as Gate, but only to summon Thoth himself).  For the postulant, this shrine will always be open.   The Astral and Ethereal murals become portals usable to enter those planes.  The postulant always has the Openness to Thoth effect of the Pneuma.
	* Modifiers
		* Postulant is...a magic user (-2), a cleric (-1), or any other class (+2)
		* Postulant has a holy symbol of Thoth (-1) and/or is a follower of Thoth (-4)
		* Postulant is evil +3
		* Postulant has visited...the Astral Plane (-1) and/or the Ethereal Plane (-1)

#### SL2-2: Deep-space Containment Units

* This chamber is 20’ tall, octagonal, and made of polished matte-white plasteel.
	* The joints between the walls and the ceiling  and floors are all rounded (without 90-degree angles).
	* In the center is a pool of gently burbling, pale-yellow, viscous, neuroderm (SL2-2a).
		* From the center rises a 1’-diameter translucent bioplas tube filled with the same stuff.
	* On the northwest side of the pool is a 4’-tall control console.
	* Against the walls stand thirteen 10'-tall opaque, hemispherical containment units resting on stone plinths.
		* The top, bottom and back are made of plasteel, while the curved front is of frosted plasglass.
		* At rudishva eye level on each unit is a 1’-square plaque of plastic on which is inscribed a Rudishva glyph (the numbers 1 to 13).
		* Flexible, lightly pulsing tubes of bioplas rise from the top of each unit, snake across the ceiling and connect to the tube rising from the neuroderm pool (SL2-2A). 
		* Channels in the floor lead from each unit to a floor drain.
		* These were used to cryogenically store wounded, ill, or criminally insane rudishva starfarers, as well as occasional strange specimens encountered during the Beacon’s far-flung travels. 
		* Status
			* Six of the thirteen units have been damaged beyond repair: the plasglass front panels of two have large cracks and spider-patterns on them.
			* The panels of two more hang open without any sign of power
			* The panels of two more are missing altogether.
			* Of the seven operable units, six are occupied and the seventh is vacant.
				* Roll, choose, or invent occupants for the six units.  It is recommended that at least one of the units contain a rudishva.

Containment Unit Operation
* Inhabitants can be released and revived using the console at SL2-2A.
	* If an inhabitant is released, the release on the plasglass screen will snap open, the yellow neuroderm will pour onto the floor and down the drain, and the subject will slump to the floor.
	* It takes 5-8 turns for the subject to recover from the experience.
* Loading a person into a containment units works in reverse.
	* The visitor steps into an empty, but usable, unit, the door is shut, and, once the console is properly manipulated, the bioplas tube fills the unit with neuroderm.
	* The effects of this process on a rudishva are these: curing of all wounds, cessation of aging, and preservation of life at a minimal state.
	* The effects on non-rudishva must be rolled on the following table (d100):
		* 1-40 Preservation of life, no other effects
		* 41-65 Preservation of life, plus full healing
		* 65-80 Incompatible: instant death
		* 81-88 Preservation of life, but inflicts a rare disease
		* 89-96 Preservation of life, but subject goes insane
		* 97-100 Preservation of life, but changes to subject’s biological makeup (GM’s choice)

##### SL2-2a: Neuroderm Pool and Console

* A pool of gently burbling yellow neuroderm in the center of SL2-2, with its control console on the northwest side of the pool. 
* Neuroderm
	* Neuroderm provides the nutrient bath through which cryogenic stasis is possible. Flexible tubes of bioplas run from the pool to each of the thirteen containment units. 
	* Neuroderm = Pa'ut (this where it was harvested by the Archonteans)
* Control Console
	* The console  is used to control the containment units.
	* It has three buttons, a smoky-gray plasglass screen, thirteen 3” slots, and a larger, 6”-wide slot.
		* Green button: activates the console, turning the screen on and allowing selection of individual containment units via the touch screen.
		* Blue button: opens the plasglass front panel of a selected containment unit.
		* Yellow button: activates the flow of neuroderm from the pool to the selected containment unit.
	* Six of the 3" slots are currently occupied by "cryogenic storage protocol" control cards (as opposed to various other bio-manipulation possibilities).
		* The control card informs the neuroderm entering the unit how to behave.  Removing a card causes the neuroderm to neutralize and become inert (fresh neuroderm is needed to receive a new program).
	* The 6" slot can intake 2 lbs of bioplas and fabricate a new, blank control card.
* Removing an Occupant
	* Turn on the power (green button), select appropriate unit on the touch-screen, removes the control card from that unit’s slot, open the plasglass front panel (blue button).
* Installing an Occupant
	* The process requires an open unit.
	* Turn power on (green button), select a unit via the touch-screen, insert a control card into that unit’s slot, open the unit (blue button), install subject in unit, close the plasglass screen (blue button), fill unit with neuroderm (yellow button).
* Creating New Control Cards
	* New protocol cards could be made for other bioengineering, medical, or analytic purposes.  It would require opening the developer console (turn on console, hold green for five seconds), knowledge of rudishva coding and bioscience, and a blank protocol card.
 
##### SL2-2b: Oval Door

* A rudishva iris door.  When opened, plasteel plates slide open in semi-circles, revealing a 4’-diameter entranceway
	* Activated by a sky blue, pale green, orange, pink, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaque).

#### SL2-3: Elevator to 6-95A

* Beyond the oval door is an elevator shaft leading down to the Arena (6-95A).
	* The walls of the shaft are undecorated stone, save for a bit of lapis inlay next to the oval door, showing a 6” orb circled by three 2” orbs. 
		* Touching the lapis inlay summons the elevator in 1 round from 6-95A.
	* If the elevator is present here (50%), it is a slab of polished blue granite, with another lapis inlay at the center.
		* The inlay shows a 1’ orb with three 4” orbs around it (the rudishva homeworld with its three moons). The elevator activates by stepping on (or placing something on) the inlay. Travelers will experience slight nausea as the elevator travels plunges down about 1,050’ to 6-95A.
	* If the elevator is not present, there is merely an empty granite shaft 1,050’ deep. 
* There is a 1% per use (cumulative) that the elevator breaks, grinding to a halt in the middle of the transit.

Elevator use: 2%

#### SL2-4: Crevasse

* The crevasse extends downward about 50’, its walls sloping gently inwards as it descends.
	* Composed of rough stone, it shows signs of having been scraped flush and/or fused into a glassy-surface at some point in the past.
* The floor of the crevasse is damp, littered with chunks of rock intermixed with brightly colored pieces of plasteel.
	* A patch of 2’-tall white mushrooms (slow stepper mushrooms) grows thickly on the floor.  If crushed or damaged (such as by landing or stepping on them) cause a slow effect (save vs poison to avoid).
	* Among the mushrooms lie numerous skeletons (4 rudishva, 2 varuda, and 3 heqeti.  The rudishva and varuda skeletons still wear pristine orange jumpsuits that.
		* Among the skeletons: a greater rudishva power supply; a laser pistol with 7-26 charges remaining; a laser rifle with 5-16 charges remaining; a sonic fence; two communication bracelets; four lesser power supplies (d20 charges each); six rudishva identity plaques (2 rust, and one each of copper, bronze, pale green, and platinum). 
	* A still-operative rudishva battle robot has sat for centuries among the corpses. 
		* It was one of two maintained by the Beacon's  crew (the other is in SL13-37).
		* It lurches into action at any sign of non-rudishva activity, having been last ordered to guard the area.
		* The crevasse is too deep for it to use its levitation beam to escape.
* GM Backstory
	* This area was once an important rudishva security office, where a team constantly guarded the valuable neuroderm and the containment units.
	* When the heqeti launched their surprise attack on the rudishva, they undermined the security outpost from below, triggering a massive collapse occurred that left the crevasse where the outpost once stood.
	* The security officers were slain instantly, but the battle robot merely received dings and dents.  It still carries out its orders to guard the outpost from all non-rudishva.

1 rudishva battle robot (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’ flying (Class A); HD 8; HP 51; #AT 4; Dmg 3-9/3-9/3-12/3-18 (laser / laser / explosive pellet 50' range (save for half) / gauss gun 30' range). Special attacks: attacks and saves as a 10th-level fighter; gauss gun strikes all targets within range each round. Special defenses: immune to fire, cold, electricity, and poison; immune to mind-affecting spells. Special: 56 explosive pellets remain. Special: those holding a plastic rudishva identity plaque will not be targeted; the robot can be controlled by a Rudishva-speaker who possesses a command bracelet.

#### SL2-5: Heqeti Staging Ground

* A long-abandoned cave dug at the end of the long tunnel from Level 9 (SL2-6).
	* The heqeti used it as a staging ground for their attack on the rudishva security outpost at SL2-4.
	* A 5’-tall statue on a 2’-tall pedestal stands to the west, roughly carved of the local granite.  It depicts as a thick-legged heqeti holding a staff in one hand and pointing towards SL2-4 with the other.
		* This is Laydassa, the heqeti builder who conceived this daring attack.
		* The statue might be sold as a curio for up to 750 gp.
	* In the center of the room is a heqeti spore bomb filled with green slime.
		* Direct handling by warm-blooded creatures has a 20% chance per round (cumulative) of activating the bomb.  Proximity to warm-blooded creatures has a 10% chance per Turn (cumulative).
