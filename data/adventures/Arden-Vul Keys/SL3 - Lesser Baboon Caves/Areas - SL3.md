## Overview

This sub-level extends from the Howling Caves (Level 2, especially 2-56F) south to the external cliff face (EX-12, aka SL3-30). It features few iconic or unusual encounters, save the precipice at SL3-25 and the (hidden) upper reaches of the Great Hall (SL3-2 through SL3-11). The tunnels leading north from SL3-30 to 2-56 are narrow, steep, and sometimes frequented by troops of albino baboons. They are not at all easy to traverse, being filled with rough 
protuberances, small stalactites and stalagmites. Unless otherwise indicated, the caverns are dark.

## Areas

#### SL3-1: Transit Cave

* A 35’-tall cave.
	* Serves as a transit point between the main colony of baboons (2-56) and those inhabiting the lesser caves of Sub-Level 3.
		* 1d4+2 large albino baboons are hanging out or passing through.
		* 25% chance of a spider from SL3-12.
	* The passage to SL3-12 emerges 30’ above the floor of SL3-1; it is invisible to casual scrutiny.
	* A secret door leading to the upper levels of the Great Hall (SL3-3), and a little-known passageway (SL3-12). 
		* Easy to spot (1-in-4) but locked (-5% and difficult), with a fresh poison needle trap (3-24 HP damage, or half on save.

3-6 large albino baboons (see new monsters) (25%): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20, 19, 18, 18, 17, 15; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

##### SL3-1A: Secret Passageway

* Dust and debris line the walls of this passage, but recent footprints (those of Tikun Thane - see SL3-2) and marks of activity make a path down its center.
	* A set of thick iron restraints for hands and feet lie near the secret door to SL3-1, along with a huge iron collar attached to a thick chain/leash.
		* Coarse white hairs (albino baboon fur) coat the restraints and collar.
	* Almost completely unknown to adventurers, and only infrequently used during the years when the cult of Thoth was at its peak.

#### SL3-2: Residence of the Overseer of Thoth

* The door to the chamber is stout wood with iron bands.
	* Its hinges have been freshly oiled and it is clean of dust and cobwebs.
	* The door has been wizard locked by a 16th-level magic user.
	* The frieze above the door reads (secret tongue of the cult of Thoth) “Kel Bormol, archmage and Overseer of Truth.”
* This chamber was home to the archmage Kel Bormol, Overseer of Truth in the precincts of Thoth.
	* In good repair, with a continual light shining from the center of the 25’ ceiling.  The colors are bright, with blues, golds, greens, and whites.
			* 150 gp of gilt could be pried out of the decorations.
	* The walls are painted in evocative Thothian-style imagery
		* Men receive wisdom from ibis-headed beings (in the form of scrolls flowing from the mouth of the ibis), then are seen dominating others, releasing powerful sorceries, and enjoying great riches.  Friezes of arcane symbols and hieroglyphs run above and below the main pictorial scheme.
	* A fire pit occupies the center of the room, burning continuously without smoke or need for fuel. A leather settee and two leather chairs are arranged around the firepit.
	* West of the door on the north wall is a basin with a bronze ibis (50 gp) in the center.
		* Water burbles from the ibis head into the basin, which will not overflow.
			* Ripping out the basin destroys the perpetual fountain effect.
	* Installed by Tikun Thane:
		* Iron rods are fixed to the walls and floor on the west side of the chamber, supporting simple black drapes, which enclose a plain bed and chest.
			* Mundane clothes, 756 gp, 6 black opals (500 gp each).
		* Two sets of iron manacles on chains are set into the east wall.
			* The restraints allow some movement, but not enough to reach the worktable.
			* Tikun Thane uses these to restrain captured baboons for training.
				* Their struggles have weakened the wall at this point (subtle to notice). With work, it could be broken down, providing a permanent entrance into SL3-14.
	* A stone table (5' tall and 5' square) is beside the north wall, to the east of the door.
		* A linen cloth is draped over a pyramidal object some 15” tall that rests at the center of the table.
			* Optional DM-niceness: a neatly printed note attached to the linen cover (Thorcinga and Archontean) “Absolutely no guest is to touch this case, lest we all die. TT.”
		* Beneath is a beautiful chessboard of ebony and ivory and silver inlay (100 gp).  The board is covered by pyramidal glass dome.
			* Most of the chess pieces have been turned into piles of white or black dust.  The black king , two black pawns, a black bishop, and a black knight remain. These pieces are of porphyry with lapis insets.  They are recognizably Archontean, but feature archaic attire.
			* An unusual brightly colored ‘piece’ sits on the board.  It has copper-rown skin, wears a tall conical hat and a bright yellow robe covered with blue eyes, and carries a crooked wooden staff.
				* This is Kel Bormol, trapped in his own chess set by a rival and kept alive in a stasis field under the glass lid (SL3-2A).  Hes moves imperceptibly  slowly in the stasis field.
	* A long wooden worktable occupies most of the south wall.
		* Littered with bits of magical apparatus (including a full alchemical set-up) on its surface and lone shelf.
			* 7 potions (philter of persuasiveness, potion of climbing, diminution, growth, invulnerability, speed, and sweet water)
			* 6 packets of dried red veil mushrooms
			* 2 parchment scrolls detailing experiments with charm, domination and mind control (250 gp to a high-level wizard)
			* A spell notebook (the Thane’s betrayal, the Thane’s collar, and the Thane’s vengeful veil)
			* A full set of glass activation squares (Tikun Thane hasn’t figured these out yet)
			* Bits of broken magical items (a pommel, a broken ring, a chipped ruby, a partly melted amulet; 25 gp each; the right artificer could salvage and combine them into a magic item).
			* A quire of parchment, titled Kel Bormol’s Chess Diary, vol. 3.
	* A 5’-tall, wooden frame, decorated with faded paintings of white ibises, stands on two legs in the southwest corner, containing a shimmering black field
		* It teleports to its twin portal, currently in Tikun Thane’s town home, the Tower of the Ape in Newmarket.
	* A 10’-tall, stone, baboon-headed figure stands in classic Egyptian pose against the northeastern wall.
		* This is Rixit, Kel Bormol’s stone golem. Its last instructions were “Wait here”, and so it hasn't moved and probably won't, unless Kel Bormol is released.
		* Rixit will not pursue enemies unless explicitly commanded to do so by Kel Bormol.
	* The secret door (west) is activated by pressing the eye of an ibis on the western wall.
*  At present the chamber is occasionally occupied by Tikun Thane, a wizard from Newmarket who found Kel Bormol’s chamber.
	* He began using it as a sanctum and staging point for capture and training of albino baboons.
	* There is a 25% chance that Tikun Thane is present, acompanied by 3 disciplined  and 4 trained large albino baboons (see new monsters).

##### SL3-2A: Prison of Kel Bormol, Archmage 

* The ancient Archontean archmage, Kel Bormol, was imprisoned within his own chess set for a millennium.
	* During the long centuries of his imprisonment, Kel Bormol won the game, disintegrated  all the white pieces, and has been fuming, waiting to be released.
	* Time passes slowly in the stasis field, and he does not know he's been imprisoned for more than a millennium.
* If the glass dome is lifted from the board, there is a hiss of escaping gas will be heard and Kel Bormol is released, springing forth in a towering rage.
	* Kel Bormol is 5’ 6” tall, slender, with a gaunt copper cheeks, closely cropped black hair, two warts by his nose, and long spidery fingers. 
	* He barks in the secret tongue of Thoth: “Are you minions of Hithra Paleologos? Answer!” If no one can understand him, he repeats in Mithric.  If this still fails, he uses Comprehend Languages.
* He states baldly: “I will ask four questions. You will answer. At the end we shall see if I let you live.”  These are his questions:
	* Are you minions of Hithra Paleologos? (for Hithra, see 3-36))
	* By what right do you enter the precincts of the Overseer of Truth? 
	* Your attire is unbecoming and ridiculous. Are you tomb robbers? 
	* Who now rules in Agoreon?
		* (GM Note: Agoreon, the ‘second capital’ of the empire was sacked in 1775 AEP, that is during Kel Bormol’s lifetime, but he assumes it was rebuilt.)
* He does not comment on answers, but interrupts with the next question if the answer drags on for very long.
	* Kel Bormol is convinced the visitors are low-class foreign tomb robbers.
	* He responds better to truth than to lies or bluffs., believes he is due respect and submission, and treats any sign of arrogance, implied entitlement (for freeing him), or physical threat badly.
	* After this ‘dialogue’, roll d20 for his reaction, using appropriate modifiers:
		* 0-) Alliance
		* 1-4) Cautious friendship

Results of Reaction Table:
* Alliance: Kel Bormol is convinced the visitors are humble and deserving of his patronage. 
	* He looks on them as small children in need of a firm but loving paternal hand. He won't  aid them directly in their endeavors, but might provide them with a lover’s tokenwith which they can contact him in dire emergencies.
* Cautious Friendship: Kel Bormol decides the party intended no evil, and are either too weak or too stupid to do him harm.
	* He is grateful for his release and for the party’s humility. He encourages them to come to the Great Hall (SL3-3 and 3-123) when they need to ask him for advice (50% chance he is spying on the area through the statue and responds in a booming, echoing voice, probably attracting beastmen).
* Neutrality: Kel Bormol decides the party is indeed a pack of lying, thieving tomb robbers, but that they intend him no harm and are unlikely to pose him any threat.
	* He orders them to disperse. Should they reenter the precincts of Thoth, he claims that the Overseer of Truth will know instantly and immediately eliminate them.
* Hostility: Kel Bormol doesn’t like the PCs’ demeanor and answers, and suspects that they are either in league with his (long-dead) enemies or are potential rivals to his power.
	* He command to his stone golem, Rixit (see SL3-2) to dispose of them, then teleports away. He should remain a recurring, if occasional villain.
* Mortal Enmity: Kel Bormol decides the lies and arrogance of the party suggest they are somehow connected to Hithra Paleologos and require instant punishment.
	* Uttering an activation command to his stone golem, Rixit (see SL3-2), he attacks with the full power of his wizardry. Should the party survive somehow, he becomes a central and active antagonist to all their endeavors.

* Kel Bormol has hidden lairs within and without the Halls (8-133, SL6-79, and AV-47).
	* If driven from this location (his preferred home), he visits 8-133 first, then AV-47  and SL6-79; he will bide his time and build his power, intending to return to the Halls and re-establish his rightful lordship here.
* He will move swiftly to assess his resources.
	* He will certainly visit the Hall of Eleven Pillars (SL4-14) to recover the Codex Sequentis hidden there.
	* Once he has learned that he has outlived the collapse of Arden Vul by 1,200 years and that all his allies and enemies are long dead, he will begin to plot a strategy designed to restore the city to its former glory.
		* This will involve locating and contacting imperial officials in Narsileon and Archontos, seizing control of the upper levels of the Halls, subjugating the goblins to his power, and so forth.
		* He will soon clear the Upper Hall of enemies, but will not initially disturb the beastmen (Level 3).

##### SL3-3a: Portico

* The east side of the Great Hall features a square room with four pillars holding up its 15’ ceiling.
	* The pillars are plain, and the walls of the room are undecorated. The portico is dark and dusty, with clinging cobwebs.

##### SL3-3b: Stone Bridge

* This 5’-wide bridge extends across the Great Hall at a level of 75’ above the floor.
	* It is lined by a low, 2’-tall wall, on which are found six 4’-tall statues of ibises (actually gargoyles).
		* The gargoyles fly to attack all those crossing the bridge.  They will try to crowd enemies over the railing and cause them to fall 75’ to the floor below.
		* Note: if Kel Bormol (SL3-2A) has been free for more than a day, then these gargoyles will have been turned into inert stone statues and will not animate.

6 gargoyles: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’, 150’ flying (Class C); HD 4+4; HP 31, 30, 28, 27, 26, 25; #AT 4; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6/1-4. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit.

##### SL3-3c: Arcade

* A 10’-wide arcade extends around the upper level of the Great Hall, 25’ below the ceiling of the hall.
	* A low, 3’ wall provides some protection from falling over the edge.
	* Four sets of obvious 2" spy holes can be found 5' up on the east, west, and south walls, connecting to dark chambers (SL3-6 and SL3-11).

##### SL3-3d: Statue of Thoth the Overseer of Truth

* An open balcony extends into the upper galleries of the Great Hall. A 15’-tall statue of Thoth, shown as a great ibis with open wings and mouth, peers vulture-like down into the Great Hall from the edge of the balcony.
	* The statue is stone, with a strange, articulated metal head, and was originally painted in vibrant colors, shreds of which remain.
	* The head swivels slowly from side to side and up and down.
	* The rear (south) side of the statue is partly hollow, allowing one to mount a low platform and peer through the eyes in the ibis head and swivel the head to view most of the hall (except directly under the balcony).
		* The viewer has perfect vision of anything in the upper or lower reaches of the Great Hall (to a distance of 150’), piercing darkness, invisibility, and stealth (as true seeing).
		* If Kel Bormol has been freed, there is a 10% chance at any time that the statue is peering around under his control from SL3-11.
	* The eyes of the statue are cylindrical diamonds (5000 gp each)with magical lenses of blue crystal (450 gp each).
		* Removed and mounted in frames, they would be ugly and ungainly with a range of only 20', but would retain their True Seeing power.  Kel Bormol will be most unhappy if the seeing apparatus is destroyed.

##### SL3-3e: Pillars and Gargoyles

* The western side of the Great Hall features an unlit, trapezoidal room with multiple undecorated pillars supporting a 15’-tall roof.
	* Along each angled wall are 4 half columns on which rest 4’ statues of ibises, actually ibis gargoyles, which animate and attack once intruders are amidst the pillars.
		* Note: if Kel Bormol has been freed, these gargoyles will still be active, as he is content to use them for security].
	* Five torn and shredded corpses of beastmen molder on the floor, dead a long time.
		* 5 sets of beastman ring mail, 5 spears, 5 short swords, and 3d6 sp per beastman.

	* Living Mosaic #1 (north)
		* Depicts the lower great hall (3-123). It shows a beastman patrol moving through the Hall.
	* Living Mosaic #2 (center)
		* Depicts a pavement with columns, and large mushroom shapes to the sides. It is the parvis of the great cavern (3-175). There is a 33% chance that a robed figure (Trocadero, 3-176) is moving across the mosaic.
	* Living Mosaic #3 (south)
		* This mosaic depicts the Thothian Hall of Judgment (2-35), a room with two triangular platforms and many dots (pillars). There is a 75% chance that baboons and Gerrilad the Grey (2-69) are moving back and forth between the triangular platforms and the pits.
	* Lights will attract any ibis gargoyles (SL3-3e) to attack.

#### SL3-5: Looted Chamber

* The living quarters for the personal guard of the Overseer of Truth, looted and pillaged long ago.
	* Piles of wood, masonry, and organic matter have been pushed against the south and western walls.  Two wooden benches are all that remain.
		* 2 Turns of searching turns up a scorched ivory scroll case (a scroll case of potency). The scroll within has been burned beyond recognition.
	* Secret Door (west): speaking the name Thoth causes it to swing open.

##### SL3-5a: Spiral Stair up to the Tower of Scrutiny (TS-19)

* The granite spiral stair is covered in a thin layer of dust, unused for 1,200 years.
	* It leads up 250’ to the basement of the Tower of Scrutiny (TS-19).

#### SL3-6: Spy Chamber

* This room is empty, dark and undecorated.
	* A pair of stone steps on the east wall provides access to two leather "helmets" hanging on pegs and the spy holes leading into SL3-3, 5' up the wall.
		* The helmets resemble WWI aviator helmets: cracked leather cowls with 2”-diameter circular yellow lenses embedded in the eye holes.
			* One of has ceased to function (both its lenses are broken).
			* Within 100 yards of the statue (SL-3D), donning the working helmet lets one see through the eyes of the statue and mentally swivel the head to examine any portion of SL3-3 or 3-123.
			* Beyond this range, it acts as goggles of seeing.

#### SL3-7: Former Barracks

* The door to this chamber has been barred from the corridor side.
* Within is a jumble of broken furniture, torn-up wall hangings, and scattered movables.
	* Six desiccated corpses lie amid the rubble; they wear copper armor and helmets, all with ibis symbols on them.
		* 6 sets of archaic banded mail; 6 zircon gems (50 gp each); an ivory token stamped with an ibis and the words (Mithric) “Overseer of Truth” (50 gp, referring to Kel Bormol in area SL3-2A).
	* The guardsmen entombed here have all become shadows.

6 shadows: SZ M; AL CE; AC 7; MV 120; HD 3+3; HP 24, 22, 20, 19, 18, 17; #AT 1; Dmg 2-5. Special attacks: STR drain. Special defenses: 90% undetectable; +1 or better weapons to hit;

#### SL3-8: Looted Room

* A storage room containing only a few crumbling shelves and broken bits of equipment.
	* A cord dangles from the exact center of the ceiling of this storage chamber. Attached to it is a hard-soled leather boot.
	* A large piece of parchment is attached to the boot.  In Mithric text large enough to be visible from the door, it reads, “Danger!”
		* The reverse side of the parchment reads: “Georgios, your feet stink. Take a bath.” The boot is harmless and was left as a joke many centuries ago when Georgios and his crew looted the room.

#### SL3-9: Circular Stair down to Level 3 (3-135)

* A broad circular staircase leads down 100’ to 3-135.
	* On the east wall is the blank face of a door without a handle (it only opens from the other side (SL3-10)).

	* In the southeast corner is a stone seat with broad armrests.  Jointed Iron rods stick up from the left and right armrests.  They can be moved to position their ends.
		* The left rod is tipped with a dully-glowing sapphire (2000 gp).
			* If spoken into like a microphone, the words boom forth from the Thoth statue at SL3-3d.
		* The right rod ends in a pair of spectacles with 1" thick yellow crystalline lenses.
			* These allow one to see through the eyes of the ibis statue at SL3-3D, swivel the statue’s head, and hear any sound made in 3-123, no matter how quiet.
		* As Overseer of Truth, it was Kel Bormol’s (SL3-2A) duty and delight to scrutinize the goings-on of the priesthood of Thoth, and act as an oracle that answered their questions.
			* Tikun Thane is aware of the chamber, but makes no use of it.
	* The chamber contains two stone chests, on the east and south walls.
		* Eastern chest: poison needle with time-weakened venom (3d6 dmg on failed save, not death).  2 extra sets of yellow lenses (1000 gp to a mage, 150 gp as curios, won't fit the goggles in SL3-6) for the apparatus, an extra blue microphone sapphire (unenchanted, 1000 gp).
		* South chest: untrapped, unlocked, and empty.
	* Secret door: opens to a thin rod

#### SL3-13: Cave-In

* The tunnel walls have collapsed, leaving a narrow 3’-tall, 30'-long tunnel bounded by rubble.
	* The legs of a buried adventurer stick out of the rubble halfway through the cave-in.
		* Purse with 25 gp, a fine pair of burgundy boots (10 gp), and a wand of secret door and trap location with 8 charges.
	* A medium creature crawling (+1x difficult terrain) through the tunnel must save vs spells at +1 to avoid further cave-in of the rubble (d8 for effect).
		* 1-2) Warning: dust and a few stones clatter around the PC
		* 3-4) A big chunk falls on the PC’s head, for 1-4 HP damage; the way is still (relatively) clear
		* 5-6) Wall collapses, partly burying the PC and inflicting 2-8 HP damage

#### SL3-14: Lesser Baboon Cave

* The floor of this large cavern undulates in a series of rocky ridges and depressions (+1x difficult terrain).
	* The caves are lit by phosphorescent lichens which offer a dim glow.
	* Several rock outcroppings of varying height (5’, 8’, 12’ and 15’) dot the cavern.
	* The cave serves as spill-over space for the baboons when the Howling Caves (2-56) grow too crowded.  They frequently sit atop the outcroppings and groom themselves.

6-15 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20, 20, 19(x3), 18(x5), 17, 17, 16, 16, 13; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

#### SL3-15: Baboon Watch Post

* A flattened pillar of rock 10’ tall and 12’ long looms near the entrance to this cave.
	* On top are 3 watch-baboons (actually watching for Ranko, from SL3-16). 
		* They have a 3-in-6 chance of surprise.  They attack any non-baboon intruders with loud hoots and screams, drawing the remainder of the pack from the main cavern (SL3-14).

3 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 19, 18, 18; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

	* A wooden chest sits by the west wall.
		* Ranko stores red veil here (3d10 dried specimens), as well as a bronze ritual dagger stolen from the priests of Set (10 gp, or 50 gp to a Set cultist), and three ‘pretty rocks’ (two chunks of coal and a chrysoberyl worth 100 gp).
* Ranko, one of the giant intelligent baboons is addicted to the red veil, and has decamped to this cave with his followers.
	* They set up the skull fetish in SL3-20, and cultivated mushrooms around it. 
	* They are ostracized by the other baboons for their chaotic and cannibalistic ways.
	* There is a 75% chance that Ranko will have just ingested a red veil mushroom, and a 25% chance for each of his followers.
		* Red Veil: ingested, lasts 1d6 Turns, -8 Wisdom, +2 defense, +3 attack, +10 tHP.  Dropping below 3 Wisdom means berserk lunacy (each round roll d4: attack nearest (1), sprint in a new direction (2), discard/smash a piece of gear and fall into stupor (3), hurl self against wall for 1d6 dmg (4))

Ranko, giant intelligent baboons (see new mon-sters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 9; HP 65; #AT 5; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-10. Special attacks: rend. When on the red veil, Ranko

#### SL3-17: Sortian Face

* A portion of the north wall of this cave, opposite the tunnel towards SL3-19, was flattened in antiquity and a Sortian face carved into it.
	* The baboons do not like the bas-relief, and tend to avoid this cave. 
	* Placing Sortian eyes into the sockets of the Sortian face activates it.
		* Only a few combinations of eyes are unique to an individual face; the rest are standard (detailed in items description).
		* Gold-Gold: all within 5’ are teleported to area 6-48
		* Gold-Sapphire: a magic mouth speaks (Mithric) from the face: "All those with the spark must be trained, regardless of their origin. The empire will be better for it. Once you have found a suitable recruit, visit the sanctum so that training may commence. Recall that proper vision comes only with yellow or blue eyes. I, Priscus the Hekate, have spoken! Oh, and if exigency requires it, you may seek our outpost along the wall of the chasm, near where the falls crash to the floor. Do not alert the Theosophs to your passage!"
* GM Notes: This cave is the destination for a Sortian face found at 6-48.

#### SL3-20: Crossroads

* In the center of the cavern is a large rock, on top of which is a small cairn of stones topped with an enormous bleached-white baboon skull.
	* The skull gleams with a low-intensity red light, barely illuminating a 10’ radius around the rock.
		* A fist-sized red garnet set beneath the skull glows with a red light (500 gp).
	* Around the rock are 4d4 small red veil mushrooms (about 3’ tall and 1’ in diameter).  Ingesting one will cause violent madness for 1-6 turns.
* Any noise or light here likely (75%) draws the attention of the baboons in SL3-22.

#### SL3-21: False Lead

* An upward-sloping tunnel, wide and clear as it leaves SL3-20, but after a turn to the north it narrows into an impassable crack.
	* At the very end of the lead is the corpse of a beastman.
		* 12 sp, a beastman-sized suit of ring mail, a spear, a dagger, and a badge (mailed fist) of the lost 3rd Cohort of the Imperial Tagmata (10 gp).

#### SL3-22: Baboon Cave

* A small troop of adolescent male baboons has been exiled to this distant cave.

#### SL3-24: Sandy Cave

* The steep tunnel from SL3-26 empties into a wide cavern with a sandy floor.
	* Rock formations jut out of the sandy floor of the cave.
	* A pod of ravenous sand worms inhabits this cave, hoping for the occasional baboon to slip off the rocks and fall onto the sand.  The mature baboons know to leap from rock to rock to avoid the sand worms.

6 sand worms (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7/2; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 14, 13, 12, 12; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attack: slurp blood (1-4 HP/rd).

			* Inkor shoots his great bow, while the baboons hurl coconut-sized rocks, accompanied by great hooting and barking.
			* Inkor shouts commands in a guttural and debased Archontean: e.g., “Rocks. Rocks! Rocks!!!”, “Kill”, “No climb!”, etc.
			* Those hit while attempting to climb the cliff must save vs Doom or fall.
* In a small "camp" are 6 dead goats, a stone basin filled with water.

Inkor, giant intelligent baboon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 59; #AT 5; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-10. Special attacks: rend. Possessions: great bow (1-10 damage).

* An upward-sloping tunnel with the remains of two adventurers, a human thief and a human magic user.
	* The thief has been badly mauled and is unrecognizable; her armor is also destroyed.
		* A short sword lies nearby, and a scrap of parchment is stuck in her boot.
	* The magic user is better preserved.
		* His pouch contains a set of mapping tools (parchment, ink, quills), some chalk, a large star rose quartz worth 50 gp, and a silver Sortian eye.
* The parchment scrap (Archontean): 
	* Howling Caves: bring light.
	* Pyramid: the suckers’s entrance.
	* Obsidian Gates: beneath the precincts of Thoth.
	* Flooded Vaults: hold the key, but to what?
	* Ask Gog for direction to the Troll Court and to the Inn of the Lost.

#### SL3-29: Crossroads

* The entrance tunnel forks here.
	* The northeastern passage begins immediately to slope steeply upwards (about 40-degree slope), 
	* The eastern tunnel is relatively flat. 
	* A carpet of bones (mostly goat, some humanoid) covers the tunnel floor here, the result of baboon feasting.

#### SL3-30: Entrance Cave (see also EX-12)

* A fold in the cliff face conceals a 4’-wide and 7’-tall crevice that leads to a set of tunnels which eventually emerge at the Howling Caves (2-56).
	* Careful observation may note animal prints (baboon) and the smell of animal urine. 
	* The tunnel to SL3-29 is only 5’ wide and varies between 5 and 8’ in height.
