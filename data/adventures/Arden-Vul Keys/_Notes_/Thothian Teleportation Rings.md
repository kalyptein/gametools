Appearance
* A set of 2”-tall paving stones arranged in a 6’-diameter ring.
* Inset into the floor next to the ring is a rectangle 48” long by 8” tall, divided into six 8” squares.

Activation
* Place six colored glass activation squares into the inset according to a sequence that matches the ‘address’ of the ring to which one wishes to travel.
	* Once placed, a brief shimmer of energy is visible over the ring.
* The user has 1 round to collect the squares and enter the ring, after which anyone in the ring is teleported without error to the address indicated by that sequence of squares.
		* If the glass activation squares are not collected they may be stranded.
