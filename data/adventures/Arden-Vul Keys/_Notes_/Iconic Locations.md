A few locations remain better known and exercise a talismanic attraction among the civilized peoples. These “iconic locations” are those which the cognoscenti might be expected to remember, even if in only a partial or even faulty manner.

Almost no common folk outside of Burdock’s Valley will know anything about Arden Vul; iconic locations are those likely to be known by sages, scholars working in the imperial or collegial libraries, and a handful of retired adventurers.

### The Arena (6-68)

The Scuttlebutt: A neutral ground deep within the mountain, where gladiatorial bouts are presided over by a fearsome undead warrior. It’s a good place to gain experience by fighting, as well as the best spot to gamble and seek information. Bring your purse, 
because the arena isn’t cheap. Although anyone can participate in arena bouts (if they dare), the house gladiators rarely lose. The Arena is hard to find within Arden Vul.

Veracity: Mostly accurate. The Arena Lord (6-85) is not undead, however, and the house gladiators do actually lose. The Arena Lord enforces peace within the Arena precincts, and anyone is permitted to participate ... if they dare. The Arena is actually easy to find, especially if one employs the Troll Lifts (e.g., 5-55 and 6-1)

Prevalence: Common

### The Court of the Goblin King (SL4-23)

The Scuttlebutt: A powerful goblin refugee from Archontos holds court in set of halls located in the upper levels. The goblin king’s powerful sorcerers and ogre guards are the source of his power. The court is a swirling hotbed of intrigue, backstabbing, and information-trading. It’s necessary to propitiate the goblin king in order to travel to the deeper levels, where the real wealth is to be found. The goblin court is best accessed through the pyramid.

Veracity: Partly accurate. The court of King Weskenim (SL4-22) is busy, but its rituals are mostly empty, and the king is eager to talk to (and impress) visitors. The goblin halls do not actually block access to the lower halls, although befriending the goblins will make it easier to access the chasm and the Sundered Span. Many informants seem to have conflated the goblin court with the larger and more dangerous court of the varumani thegn (7-75).

Prevalence: Uncommon

### The Drowned Canyon (SL6-24)

The Scuttlebutt: The Drowned Canyon is an El Dorado-like location, where the un-plundered tombs of ancient imperial officials lie ripe for the looting. Most informants will confidently 
claim that one of the great lost treasures of antiquity is definitely to be found there: e.g., the iron circlet of Ghanor, the bone ring of Jagri-Naz, the armor of Sulla, or any of the unique, named magic weapons (see new magic items). Of course, most of those rumors are not true. Reports about why the canyon is ‘drowned’ vary, with most speaking of a vast lake that covers the tomb entrances. Most reports claim that there is only one entrance to the canyon, and that it is to be found in a hidden location within the old temple precincts (e.g., Levels 3 or 4). 

Veracity: Some of the general information is accurate, including access routes found at 3-87 and 5-115, but the information about specific treasures is entirely false.

Prevalence: Rare

### The Forge of Zhorak (8-100)

The Scuttlebutt: Attracted by the magical properties of Arden Vul, the legendary dwarven smith Zhorak set up his forge under the cliff of Arden Vul. The forge can be used to create magical items to this day, provided the smith knows the correct formulae, is strong 
enough to operate the forge, and/or can master the magical stone within which the forge was carved. Reports vary about Zhorak’s fate: some think he is still living within Arden Vul, forging esoteric items. Others believe that, having been betrayed by imperial authorities, he ‘took to the stone’ somewhere within Arden Vul, leaving his stash of enchanted equipment to be plundered by the canny and bold. 

Veracity: The basic report that Zhorak’s forge remains open and usable is true. The report that Zhorak ‘took to the stone’ is interesting, if ultimately incorrect (for Zhorak’s fate, see 8-97); it’s interesting because most Archonteans don’t know almost anything about Dwarven culture, let alone this closely-guarded secret. Of course, most rumor-mongers don’t really know what ‘took to the stone’ means. The other details are mostly fabulous. 

Prevalence: Esoteric

### The Forum of Set (4-2)

The Scuttlebutt: Although it has been proscribed for centuries within all civilized territories, a cult of the god Set (one of the Twelve) has risen again, and has reoccupied the old market forum within Arden Vul. The forum is easy to access through a hole on the cliff-face. The cultists welcome those who show respect to their dread Lord, and particularly to those who bring valuable goods to trade in the Forum. The Forum is the best site from which to outfit 
expeditions to other parts of the Halls, at least for those strong enough to resist the nefarious slavers guild, known as the Guild of Service. The high priest of Set commands the loyalty of lots of monsters, who provide security for the Forum.
 
Veracity: Mostly accurate, especially about the trading function of the Forum and the access point on the cliff-face. 

Prevalence: Common

### The Glory of Thoth (3-2)

The Scuttlebutt: A glorious, bejeweled statue depicting the god Thoth (one of the Twelve). The statue is said to lie directly beneath the Pyramid of Thoth (AV-15). One must beware, for 
the Glory comes to life to protect followers of Thoth and to smite evildoers. It is said that placating the Glory with gifts of gnostic knowledge will secure a blessing from the god.

Veracity: Mostly accurate. The statue is located directly beneath the pyramid, and offerings of scrolls do produce a blessing of sorts. The statue does not come to life but is, however, part of a complex puzzle leading to the hidden treasury of Thoth (3-23 and 3-24).

Prevalence: Common

### The Great Cavern (3-163, 3-172)

The Scuttlebutt: The priests of Thoth discovered in antiquity an enormous underground cavern containing a river, lake, and giant grove of mushrooms. Strange creatures lived in the groves, but the Thoth priests tamed them. The temple used the fungal forests not only for food, but also as a site in which to conceal the tombs of their favorite priests, including the legendary Ptarmis, who discovered the grove. Today the Cavern is nearly empty, and ripe for pickings. Watch out for the dragonflies, though!

Veracity: Almost entirely true. The dragonfly reference refers to the automatons of Kerbog Khan (SL12-25), which can be either helpful or harmful.

Prevalence: Common

### The Great Chasm (2-63A, 3-38, 5-34, 6-108, 7-3, 8-2, 9-1) 

The Scuttlebutt: A giant chasm at least 1,000’ deep bisects all the underground region of Arden Vul. It’s the best way to travel between the multiple levels, especially since a giant staircase has been cut into the walls of the chasm. The only danger are the cave worms that dwell within holes in the chasm wall. It is said that six waterfalls plunge down the chasm! One hot tip is that the shrine to the great Archon Marius is located just off the chasm about 
halfway down the shaft.

Veracity: Partly accurate. The chasm does extend from level 2 to level 9, and does provide the surest method for quick ascent or descent. While the staircase is a myth, the system of troll lifts (5-55, 6-1 to 6-5, 7-1, 8-1) provides a relatively safe way of traversing the chasm. The shrine of Marius (6-154) is not really located ‘just off ’ the chasm. The story about the cave worms is a total urban legend, created centuries ago by bored adventurers; other threats, including cavern cephalopods, do lurk within the chasm, though.

Prevalence: Uncommon

### The Great Hall (3-123)

The Scuttlebutt: A giant hall of crucial importance to the exploration of Arden Vul. Some argue that the Great Hall is the same as the Hall of Forty Pillars, while others claim it holds the Obsidian Gates, and still others speak of it in hushed tones as the punishment hall of the priesthood of Thoth, where the barks and whoops of dead prisoners still echo today. Only a handful describe it as two- or three-story hall filled with broken pillars and strange statuary, lying moreover in a strategic position on the borders of the territory of some deadly humanoid warriors. All agree, however, that the Great Hall is an essential landmark, one that provides a jumping off point to (fill in the blank with a specific location - the most reputable accounts accurately note that it leads directly to the Great Cavern). 

Veracity: Mixed, mostly because the name of this location is vague enough that explorers have been willing to identify many locations (2-35, 5-66, 6-68, 8-7, etc.) as the ‘true’ Great Hall. After all, any imposing hall may well seem ‘great’ to a visitor. The GM could use the general confusion about this location to seed false rumors, or, conversely, to provide useful information to those exploring the upper levels. Ironically, none of the accounts realize that one of the greatest treasures lost within Arden Vul - the iron circlet of Ghanor - is located in a secret tomb just off the Great Hall (3-127).

Prevalence: Common

### The Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6)

The Scuttlebutt: A dark, ominous hall filled with heavy, squat pillars. Croaking sounds emanate from the very pillars! Although the Hall of Forty Pillars contains no treasure itself, it is essential to locate, since it leads directly to the fabled Obsidian Gates. Some dark rumors suggest that the souls of dead adventurers are imprisoned within the pillars. The Hall is said to lie on the level below the old Archontean temples. A few claim it was not built by human hands.

Veracity: Mostly accurate, although the rumors that the pillars contain souls are false. The croaking noises come from the strange toads that inhabit the hall.

Prevalence: Rare

### The Howling Caves (2-56)

The Scuttlebutt: A series of natural caves abutting the old precincts of Thoth in the upper levels. They take their name from the howls and moans that emanate from them. Explanations for the howling vary. Most attribute them to the hunger of a battalion of ghouls created from the corpses of long-dead priests abandoned during the Archontean retreat. Others claim the howls are produced by a series of mutant dogs that roam the ruins. All, however, claim that it is best to exercise extreme light- and noise-discipline when exploring the precincts of Thoth. No treasure rumors are associated with the Caves; they are mostly cited as a sort of ‘bogey-man’ designed to frighten or intimidate new explorers.

Veracity: Mixed. The literal Howling Caves are indeed found to the south and east of Level 2, but most explorers use the phrase to describe all of Level 2. The ghoul story is erroneous (although some nasty ghouls can be found nearby, at 2-20 to 2-22). The ‘mutant dog’ story is closer to reality, as the howls are produced by the large albino baboons that hunt in packs. Most accounts are hazy about which parts of the precincts of Thoth are affected by the Howling Caves; for instance, Level 3 is part of the precincts of Thoth but lacks baboons and howls.

Prevalence: Uncommon

### The Inn of the Lost (6-7 to 6-20, 6-28)

The Scuttlebutt: A welcome beacon of refuge amid all the hazards of Arden Vul. This inn is operated by a kindly old gentleman, whose magical abilities ensure that no monsters enter 
the Inn. Rates are reasonable, given its location, and the common room even features decent entertainment. Look for the Peace Door (6-7A), which is located in a corridor lying just east of the Chasm.

Veracity: Accurate. It is true that the Inn offers protection versus all external threats; the rumors do not reveal, however, that the proprietor, Thegan Whitemane, is not always as kindly as he seems (nor is he a sorcerer).

Prevalence: Common

### The Obsidian Gates (5-6D)

The Scuttlebutt: A gigantic pair of black, stone doors, beyond which lies the fabled wealth of several lost civilizations. Although famously difficult to penetrate, each report about them 
usually includes a ‘sure-fire’ way to get past them. Some of those schemes include tracing the strange glyphs on the doors three times, sacrificing to the correct god in front of the gates, locating a stone guardian whose fingers act as keys to the gates, and so forth. Regardless of the variety of methods for breaching the Gates, the reports uniformly describe vast and unique treasures to be looted behind the Gates. The more sophisticated reports add that these treasures come from an ancient lost civilization that predates the Archonteans. A handful of accounts reveal that the Gates are warded against most ordinary magic, including knock and teleport. The rumors place the Obsidian Gates at the end of, or 
just beyond, the Hall of Forty Pillars, in the middle levels of Arden Vul. All agree that the Gates were never penetrated by the great sorcerers of antiquity.

Veracity: Accurate, except concerning the methods of penetrating the Gates (some of which are downright dangerous!). 

Prevalence: Uncommon

### The Pyramid of Thoth (AV-15)

The Scuttlebutt: A huge pyramid standing in the ruins of the above-ground city of Arden Vul. The pyramid was a central site for the worship of Thoth, and still contains a bejeweled cult statue. More importantly, the pyramid contains the best and most reliable way of entering the dungeon levels. It is said that placating the cult statue is the way to open the route to the dungeons. Wise speakers might comment on the strange fact that the pyramid is one of 
the few structures in the city that was not ruined by the (dragon, Sortian magic, giants, divine anger - the cause varies by speaker) that destroyed the city. 

Veracity: The basic facts are accurate, except for the causes for the city’s destruction.

Prevalence: common

### The Red Bridge (4-120A)

The Scuttlebutt: A bridge made of red stone spanning a depthless chasm and leading straight to the Forum of Set. Reaching the Red Bridge is a sign that one is safe within the precincts of Set. Most agree that the Red Bridge is also enchanted such that it prevents those intending harm to Set from passing. The Bridge is best accessed through a cave on the cliff face, to the west of the waterfall; one must traverse several ruined halls before reaching it.

Veracity: Mostly accurate. Although located on the southern borders of the safe zone delimited by the cult of Set, the Bridge is not entirely safe, as cavern cephalopods often threaten those who traverse it. The Bridge is enchanted, but not in the manner suggested by the rumors; instead, it amplifies footfalls so as to alert the Set guardsmen of approaching visitors. 

Prevalence: Rare

### The Sundered, or Imperial, Span (5-35)

The Scuttlebutt: A prominent landmark within Arden Vul, this bridge crosses the Great Chasm at a point about halfway down the chasm’s vertical distance. It marks the boundary between the territory of the goblins to the west and the vicious trolls to the east. The name given to the Span varies by the teller; those of a more historical or scholarly bent might accord the bridge the name ‘Imperial Span’ as a memory of its role in helping ensure the Archontean hegemony; more casual or more recent travelers might call it the Sundered Span, noting that it has been broken in the middle (although a jury-rigged repair job still allows passage). A few accounts warn of the swarms of goblins and/or Arden Vul trolls that guard either end of the Bridge; these enemies must either be defeated or bribed to allow passage. There’s a small chance that an interlocutor describes an ‘island’ floating in the chasm below the Span (i.e., 6-4).

Veracity: The basic facts of the Span’s location, status (sundered), and proximity both to the goblins and the varumani are accurate. The stories about hordes of goblins and ‘trolls’ are 
alarmist; the goblins to the west welcome visitors willing to pay a small toll, while the varumani outpost to the east is in fact the topmost station in the system of troll lifts (5-53 to 5-55).

Prevalence: Rare

### The Troll Market (7-76)

The Scuttlebutt: An exotic market in the lower levels where all manner of bizarre goods - from coins, statuary, gems and magic, to living creatures and strange plants - are sold by traders hailing from deep beneath the earth. The Troll Market is operated by the band of 
vicious trolls that control the lower levels; they patrol the market atop giant riding lizards and tolerate no disturbances. In fact, unless they are well lubricated with coin and/or information, they are likely to take offense and sell the incautious into Underearth slavery. Still, the Market is said to be the best place to acquire relics from the lost civilizations that occupied Arden Vul before the Archonteans. To reach the Market, one needs to pass the Sundered Span and traverse the Great Chasm almost to the bottom.

Veracity: Partly accurate. It is true that exotic goods are traded here, and that the market is located a good ways down the chasm. The scare stories about the vicious trolls are exaggerated, however; the varumani warmly welcome those traders whom they have invited to the market (by granting them a troll thegn’s passport).

Prevalence: Esoteric

### The Well of Light (2-1)

The Scuttlebutt: A man-sized well leading from the surface of the ruined city to the private precincts of the old priesthood of Thoth. By all accounts, the Well is extremely dangerous, and only the most experienced and well-warded adventurers are advised to even consider testing it. Some accounts emphasize the blinding glare or even burning interior surface of the well; other accounts focus on the troops of undead, including magic using creatures, that lie at the foot of the well. Still, a common refrain about the Well links it to the lost library of Thoth, which is said to contain much lost and valuable knowledge (2-7); for this reason, there 
seems to be no end of adventurers willing to risk the well. It is easy to find the mouth of the well amid the ruins of the northeastern quadrant of the city, not far from the pyramid of Thoth.

Veracity: The basic facts are fairly accurate, as the well is located near the pyramid, and does debouch near both the library of Thoth and the secret library of Thoth (2-72). The dangers of 
climbing up and down the well are largely exaggerated, as are the threats awaiting those who successfully make the climb: rather than undead, it is the packs of feral baboons who pose the greatest threat to adventurers.

Prevalence: Rare

### The Ziggurat (10-32 to 10-37)

The Scuttlebutt: A cursed ziggurat built of cyclopean blocks of pitted, greasy stone occupies the lowest levels of Arden Vul. The ziggurat serves as the focus for a demon-prince of great power and malevolence. His servitors periodically restore the shrine, from which emanates great evil and corruption. The archons of old cleansed the ziggurat thoroughly, but (say some) evil has crept back into the site. Perhaps a new alliance of heroes is needed to cleanse 
it for good? Reports are vague about the location of the ziggurat, except to note that it lies below the foot of the Great Chasm.

Veracity: Mostly accurate as far as it goes. The ziggurat is devoted to the worship of the demon-prince Kauket, and the heqeti have indeed restored the site. The ziggurat can be accessed through tunnels leading downwards from the chasm floor (see 9-82).

Prevalence: Esoteric
