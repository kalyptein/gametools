plasteel and plasglas = eld-steel and eld-glass, to the ancient archonteans?

archontean called the rudishva "eld", drifted to "elves"?


## Rudishva

Isoc-Crix (6-20)
- survived the plague because vampire, still alive because vampire

Melok-Ri (SL10-32)
- survived the plague because vampire, still alive because vampire

Psalor-Ki (5-74)
- survived the plague because born on this world (proto-elvish?), still alive because blood sorcery and weird science, a "blood lich"
* half attuned to this world and sorcery
* loathed by the other survivors
* works
	* developed the Hybridization used to transform into elves
	* co-developed the treatment that creates nano-encrusted xeno-undead
	* tried to create a superior varumani strain using his own blood

Crelik-Var, the Arena Master (6-85)
- survived the plague because genetic lottery (damaged by fever, already some brain damage), still alive because extensive over-use of auto-doc and cybernetics, which have further eroded his personality
* political / morale officer
* he loved the contests in the arena during the Rudishva heyday, and so gravitated back there and drifted into his current role

The Arena
* Arena is actually a 4000 year old Heqeti arena, passed through many hands.  Crelik-Var made it the modern arena post-archontean collapse, assuming his current persona.
* Arena's symbol is a green field emblazoned with a black image of a six-sided die


Reiv-Tor (SL7-23)
- survived the plague because emergency bio-engineering with aquatic DNA (heqeti, plus piscine), still alive because further (endless) genetic tinkering
* obsessed with creating new lifeforms, mad scientist

Naik-Lir (SL7-13)
- survived the plague along with early forms of Reiv-Tor's piscine treatments.  Served as Reiv-Tor's aide until used as a lab rat and then turned into a giant rudishva skeleton after being tortured to death by Reiv-Tor.
* security officer

Artax-Ris (3-39)
- was infected with the plague, sought to slow it with medtech, working with Psalor-Ki, they developed the nano-undead treatment.  He thought he could use it "correctly" and Psalor-Ki didn't.  Artax-Ris stole a hyperbaric chamber they'd been working with and turned himself into a giant rudishva skeleton.
* was a science officer, kind of arrogant (surgeon), clashed with Reiv-Tor

Grev-Kilj
* “Grev-Kilj the Far-Seer, Tamer of the Winged Ones, Lord of Air and Earth, Student of Subterranean Life Forms, Slayer of the Hopping-Ones.”
* After speaking with Psalor-Ki, chose to became undead to watch for the return of the Heqeti to wreak vengeance on them.

4 in deep storage (SL2-2): Triv-Lok, Plec-Gris, Kelo-Rep, Talg-Roe

Giant rudishva skeletons
* A dangerous nano-conversion mixed with principles of necromancy to keep flesh from dying.  A desperate attempt to stop the heqeti plague.  It seemed to work at first, but gradually overran the body and turned you into a hulking nano-encrusted skeleton cyberundead.
	* The encrustations can be broken off and thrown ("bones"), rapidly regrowing.
	* Could be done to dead Rudishva, reviving bodies but not minds.
	* Only works on beings with extensive Rudishva tech in them; Varumani, Varuda, and Rudishva.  Probably not elves, and not trollkin.


## The Beastmen, Children of Deino

- Deino is a quasi-immortal priestess of Isis.  Her blood "phylactery" keeps her alive, but whatever humanity she had has degraded over the centuries until she's just interested in her own schemes and pleasures.
- Beastmen are created from an alchemy somewhat like the homunculi, but she has no paut, nor all the expertise the old priest-sorcerers could muster (and maybe rudishva).
	- They aren't fertile, though they do have sex.
	- Instead Deino uses an "inverted rebirth of Osiris"
		- A freshly dead beastman is cut into pieces (often 7) and these are rendered down in cauldrons containing various ingredients, including a drop of blood phylactery and transformation wine.
		- Like homunculi, the cauldron brews congeal and form into young-adult beastmen.  They are new people, no trace of the flesh donor.  They are near-mature, but ignorant and must be trained up, roughly adolescent.
		- Aged beastmen may be euthanized with her poison brew, giving their lives to produce the next generation.
	- The beastmen are truly unable to be free of Deino, if they even wanted to be.  She is truly their mother.
		- Only she has the seceret of the blood phylactery brew.
- Can play up the divide in the beastmen between imperialistic bent and more willing to live-and-let-live, but for them to be free, not only must the imperialists be defeated, but some solution to Deino's stranglehold on their breeding must be found




## Goblin Kingdom


## Poisoners & the Crimson Trust

Phlebotomas Plumthorn's Crew

* The Poisoners are an independent group, but allied with the Crimson Trust, who are buying their product.

	* Parames Plumthorn (Phlebotomas Plumthorn) - archontean
	* Rosk Winterclaw (Roskelly Winterleaf)
	* Blandveg (human mage)
	* Loma Fleetpaw (Carloman Fleetfingers)



## The Heqeti



## The Kaliyani & Lizardmen

The kaliyani / ophidians are native to this world, from a lost prehistoric age of reptiles.  For reason they don't understand, they have degenerated over time, yielding the primitive lizardmen and fewer highly intelligent psionic sorcerers.
* They allied with the Rudishva when they arrived, seeing in their advanced bioscience (used to create the Varuda and Varumani) a chance to reverse their decline.  Eventually they became convinced the Rudishva were never actually going to share their tech, maybe were even withholding the answers.  They colluded with the heqeti to kill the Rudishva, planning to seize the tech for themselves.
	* ??? In return to the rudishva, they provided native guides and sorcery / psionics, which the rudishva could not practice due to their bioengineering and cyberware???
* Ultimately, they weren't able to get the answers they wanted.
* Did they fail to make off with the tech?  Maybe the rage of the surviving Varumani, their own losses in the struggle, and the heqeti turning on them (or their plague and/or slimes being indiscriminate) forced them to flee.
* Now the would-be Eleventh Consortium has come back, hoping they can finally get that tech and solve the issue, which would definitely make them heroes to their kind and 

Skreel Lizardmen


## The Cult of Set


## The Sun-Scarred Knights

what are the Sun-Scarred Knights and Melok-Ri up to?
* shepherding civilization in AV: goblins, beastmen, varumani, and now setites
	* but they don't like the heqeti, and ignore lizardmen, fishmen.  kaliyani, priscians are new and small; what status quo have they been protecting?
	* what about the bast temple, why not including them?

* Isok-Crix and Melok-Ri create the Harmonious Brotherhood (total 7 members), believing since the rudishva are here for a good long while, they should shake off complacency and colonize the region and bring local humans into the hegemony.  They start ranging into the surroundings. 
	* They found the sun-scarred hold and operate from there
* The encounter an elder vampire, who overcomes and turns them.  Their alien biology / psychology isn't enslaved by his power (elves are immune to charm after all), so they overwhelm the unsuspecting master.
* They can't range outdoors anymore, oops.
* The Brotherhood dissolves
	* IC and MR slay the others because they want to turn all the rudishva into vampires
* 
* Heqeti return, rudishva are destroyed
* 
* IC and MR covertly help the varumani survive and establish elsewhere?
* IC and MR split acrimoniously, MR retains their hold as his base.  IC leaves, disgusted by his vampiric nature
* 
* Archonteans inhabit AV, heqeti driven out, rudishva survivors make nice, varumani bend the knee
* 
* Arena Lord takes over the abandoned heqeti arena and reopens it.  Popular with varumani and archonteans.
* 
* 
* 
* Collapse of AV, Theo-Sort War
* 
* * MR creates a New Harmonious Brotherhood using human vamps, driven to protect civilization, which is once again crumbling
	* Rud vamps can't be controlled by their master, and turn out not to be able to control human childer?  (or he just won't?)  His kids grow increasingly evil and plot against him
* MR slays his human spawn, except Cinna Minux, who escapes into hiding
* 
* MR founds Sun-Scarred Knights w/ normal humans
	* They are to protect "civilization" in AV from further disasters, morphing into a weird neutrality code
	* he feeds them his own alchemically altered blood (do they know what it is?), empowering them, this one-step removal from actual vamping, plus the sun-scarring ritual protect their minds.
	* When they grow old, they "go to the master", and he drains them, reclaiming the blood and preventing them from rising as vamp spontaneously after a lifetime of vitae-consumption.  This happened a few times and they had to be put down (one or two might have been taken into Cinna Minux's court)
		* Play up Minux's desire to destroy the Knights and IC, to rule civilization in AV instead of just protect it (a warped version of his old ethos, he was a knight of the prior order)
		* the knights know to recover the bodies of their fallen comrades and deliver them to the master
* 
* 
* IC creates the Inn of the Lost as a refuge and reason to get up in the morning (750 years ago)
	* sought to create a place all would be welcome, and no violence
* 
* Deino arrives (pronounce DAYN-oh, not DINE-oh?)
* 
* Heqeti return, Sun-Scarred resist them
* 
* Failed Archontean expedition, Deino creates beastmen, Knight accept them as part of civilization
	* Thegan Whitemane imprisons IC, takes his place.  Uses the blood-alchemy trick that the Sun-Scarred Knights use (from IC's notes, who worked it out with MR, translated with help from Deino, starting their partnership)
* 
* Setites show up, Knights concerned, give them a pass as a useful weakening of the varumani trade monopoly
* 
* Varumani considering enslaving the goblins, Knights subtly resist


What will the Knights think of the returned Kaliyani?  Traitors or acceptable civilized elements?

Interests
* 

Missions
* 

Specific: Spes has an original phlamoulon (triangular battle stand-ard) from the 4th cohort of the II Legion (Sheepshead Rangers), who were slain to a man in Adrienic’s ill-fated expedition versus the troll thegn (7-76); the phlamoulon is worth 10,000 gp to a current officer in the Imperial infantry.

knights who require some space for meditation. Sir Spes, the beastman knight, frequently comes here to meditate and practice a series of poses that resemble tai-chi. A few other knights, both past and present, have secretly used the chapel to worship solar deities from ‘real’ pantheons (e.g. Horus and Seker in the old days, and Mitra and Atashak in the present). Of the current knights, only Sir Hegemon (SL10B-19) harbors any such religious beliefs.

Larel also has a wooden specimen box with 24 compartments, each carefully labelled and 
holding a dried specimen of exotic mushroom (including each of those in the new flora appendix). Finally, Larel has also begun a sketchbook featuring chasm cephalopods, including several exploded views of their anatomy, complete with annotations showing features and abilities. Anyone spending an hour with his notes will have a good understanding of them and will gain a permanent +1 to hit versus chasm cephalopods. The sketchbook also offers a theory on the origin of chasm cephalopods, suggesting they were released by ‘the travelers from the Beacon.’

Inhabitants: Sir Larel is currently in the library (SL10A-22). See his stats at that location.

He has hung a silk banner over his bed on which is an insipid motivational phrase (“Fight Some of the Bad Days to Earn Some of the Good Days”), albeit in a beautiful formal Archontean calligraphic style. He has the tips of four stalactites on his desk, ranging in size from 6” to 2’ and in hue from pure white to creamy yellow in color. A drawer of his desk contains a set of wooden racks containing a fine example of a silver penny from each of the last 117 imperial reigns (worth 50 gp as a collection).

##### Melok-Ri, Master Malachite

* goals / schemes

messages left for M-R
1. “Master, allow me to search for Sixth. His return is badly overdue. [signed] Spes.” GM: Sir Sixth is currently senseless and lost in area 6-39; Sir Spes requests permission to locate and aid him.
2. “Master, I am concerned at the paucity of postulants. Allow me to take several goblins, humans or halflings from the upper levels and subject them to the trials. [signed] Calculor.” GM: Sir Calculor is currently away on a short mission; he hopes his request will be addressed before his return.
3. “Master, [the GM should write a short note describing a recent adventure/action taken by the PCs within Arden Vul.] This group is dangerous and needs watching ... or elimination. Give me the honor of seeing to it. [signed] Discord.” GM: the point is to convey to PCs that their actions have been observed by the knights, and that one – Discord – would like to take proscriptive action against them. Discord is currently located at 8-116.
4. “Master, the new group of human mages has mustered a large expedition into the old heqeti areas at the foot of the chasm. They are well-organized and extremely dangerous. I fear that, if left unchecked, they will disturb the balance of power we have so carefully worked to achieve. Their strength is such that a combined assault may be necessary to eliminate them. Your wisdom in this matter is desired. [signed] Ennius.” GM: Sir Ennius (SL10B-29) is referring to the Priscian encampment at 9-31.

## Priscians, the Eigth Collegium

	* He's created a secret collegium, training illegal mages from students unable to get into collegia for various reasons but who have a spark fo magic.
		* He is using the Sortian idea of democratizing magic, but combined with a cult-like indoctrination and "keeping magic for the worthy".  He uses them as his agents.
		* He's crafted a hierarchical mystery cult, initiating his apprentices into new tiers when they prove loyal enough.  Subordinates are not to question the judgement of higher initiates.



## The Varumani

	* seeking Gislu, Pillik learned they knew and is pestering them (they want the sceptre for the heqeti)
	* killed a band of kaliyani at 8-8 and are redeeming the bounty on fangs, earning favor

* Gaius Christopher
	* grizzled, polite knight of the azure shield; here offering friendship with Lady Alexia and lordship of the Halls in return for the archon's regalia.  Varboka has decided to obstruct this, as he doesn't want powerful archonteans reclaiming the halls (but hasn't told Gaius, leaving him twisting)

Others

* Ludrig
	* recently depetrified true varumani ambassador to the ancient Arden Vul archon.
	* 
	* Ludrig is quite intelligent, and fluent in Mithric. He served as an advisor to the Archonteans during the period in which the troll thegn (7-30) accepted imperial suzerainty. Ludrig’s appearance at the varumani court (7-75) would create a major stir; still, once his identity was established, many varumani would shun him as a collaborator.

### Faction Relations

##### Internal

* Waning of the Varumani
	* The varumani are breeding less and less true over the centuries.  Beyond Arden Vul, with its plentiful arcanum, the degenerate into trolls much quicker.  They are low-key concerned about this.
		* Rudishvan bioscience in its full flower might be able to correct / stabilize this.  In lesser form, it might allow a controlled descent to trollkindom.
* The Ancestral Halls
	* Varboka and Ashoka know the ways to the ancestral halls on Level 5, but haven't found Vanara's resting place (they would pay well for the info).
* Hunter's Fate
	* The Hunters wish to know the fate of Bedara, a member (taken by heqeti on level 9, imprisoned in 10-8).  Rescuing her brings friendship with the hunters.
* Jealous Hraskaya
	* Envious of Varboka, seeks to undermine his rule and advance himself.  Clear evidence of misdoing would let Varboka move against him confidently.
* Framing of Gog
	* Gog was known as upright and honorable, a shock that he did a crime and had to be exiled.  Varboka and a few others suspect he was framed.
		* 
		* WHAT WAS HIS SUPPOSED CRIME?
		* Muq framed Gog for a crime, something treasonish?
		* Conspiring with the kaliyani against the thegn / court for gain.  Actually it's Muq who cut this deal, framing Gog, helping the kaliyani by disrupting the court.
		* what proof is there to be uncovered?
		* detail the site of the supposed crime for investigation
		* 
	* Framed by Muq (8-151).  Clearing Gog's name brings thegn's favor.
	* 
	* This was a ploy by Hraskaya to hassle Varboka, as Gog was a friend and supporter, and Varboka's tolerance and mercy was cast as weakness.
	* 

##### External

* Cinna's Influence
	* he seeks to manipulate the varumani to advance his power
	* willing agents
		* ???
	* mesmerized victims
		* Janara, Gog, Muq, Lithric, Riglon (other lift overseers?)
* Kaliyani Interlopers
	* The Varumani know there are Kaliyani in the Halls, at least one scouting party-worth, maybe more?  Varboka would gladly lead a war against them if he realizes there is a whole base.
		* Varboka has placed a 100 gp bounty per kaliyani fang
		* Varboka hopes this might be his path to glory, smiting this ancient, hated foe.
* Arcane Resources
	* Ashoka would like to expand the varumani's arcane capabilities.  He knows the Priscians are snooping around, and hopes he might be able to follow them to Sortian or Thothian lore, or take something from them directly.  Fears they will poach secrets from the Halls first.
* Heqeti Hunting
	* The varumani hunt them as worthy prey and mostly see their presence as a steady-state thing, a foe to fight, all good fun.  The Hunters have begun to see an uptick in their boldness and numbers.
* Gevorda's Feud with the Khan
	* 
	* People know she's domineering, so they're not exactly surprised she got in a spat with the Khan.  No one is immediately leaping to help her out of insult to the varumani people (she should have been able to take care of herself, or she was dumb).
		* She's happy to promise loot and favor to raiders who join her, so she doesn't need them to act out of ire.
	* Her getting slapped down and captured mays some of them to who just see him as a toymaker wonder if he could be a threat.
	* 
	* the Khan has blood samples from both Ashoka and Gog, and probably a number of other varumani.  This may make them hesitate to clash with him, but Gevorda may use that threat over them as a reason to deal with him now, before he uses it against them (as clearly he will, seeing how he treated her)
	* 
* Priscian Presence
	* suddenly appearing the lower halls, very concerning.  Ashoka and Varboka are suspicious of them, but permit them in the market blandly polite.
	* Glif and Nogli captured a Priscian while out hunting, they and Ashoka hope to extract info.
		* The Priscian prisoner (7-24) is named Noredden. Glif and Nolgi encountered Noredden in the Nether Reaches. After slaying her conversi, they captured her and brought her back to the varumani court for interrogation. Noredden has thus far revealed little, and Glif and Ashoka are growing frustrated; more advanced torture is imminent. The sorcerers are seeking specific information on the access points to the Priscian areas (9-58 to 9-64), and details of its layout. The thegn fully supports the sorcerers’ efforts, as he worries about the existence of a powerful force in an unknown location. Varboka is unaware that Ashoka is also interrogating Noredden with the hopes of extracting information about a hidden tomb connected with the Sortians (i.e., the Tomb of Isadora at Sub-Level 11). Unfortunately Noredden knows nothing of that tomb, nor even much about Isadora. 
* Setites
	* Didn't like this reminder of Archontean domination, but while they remain in the upper halls, they are too far away to bother with.  Just watched them.
	* Lost some business to the Forum, but not too bad.  Weren't sorry to see them go.
	* Intef and his fellow Setites (Lithiric, Jodran Rivulus, etc) seek to spread Set's gospel of domination to the Varumani and rise again
* Sun-Scarred Knights
	* Respect their individual prowess, don't get their ethos, but don't see them as rivals.  Their advice and ways are mysterious but clearly potent and draw intrigued attention from the varumani, more than they realize (maybe a bit of vamp gaze to assist that).
* Subjugation of the Goblins
	* 
	* ??? why moving to do this now, when Weskenim is paying tribute?
	* 
* Doppels
	* The doppelgangers seek to establish a beachhead at the troll market for deep expeditions.
* 

The Survivors
* Isoc-Crix / Thegan
	* He remains a welcome neutral place for factions.
* Melok-Ri / Sun-Scarred Knights
	* Few varumani know anything more than the vague name "Master Malichite".  Varboka, Ashoka and maybe a few others know Melok-Ri leads them.  Respect and caution for the Knights
* Crellik-Var / The Arena
	* He remains a welcome neutral place for factions and entertainment
* Psalor-Ki
	* Aloof and enigmatic sorcerer to be left alone or rarely parleyed with.
* Reiv-Tor / Fishmen
	* Lost track of him centuries ago, know nothing of him.



The Logbooks of the Thegns: This title comprises a collection of 103 quarto codices bound in grey lizard hide. The logbooks annalistically record the deeds and events of the varumani, both good and bad, in the voice of every varumani thegn from the 8th to the 37th (i.e., to Varboka in the present). The earliest codex (the sole logbook of the 8th thegn) records the submission of the varumani to the archon, Marius Tricotor, called ‘invictus’ (see 6-154); the third logbook of the 16th thegn records the retreat of the Archonteans; the fourth logbook of the 31st thegn records the glorious varumani victory over Adrienic at the Cave of Blood (7-76); and so forth.  The number of logbooks produced by a given Thegn varies by the length of that thegn’s reign and by personal proclivity; it is evident to any serious scholar, for instance, that the logbooks have become terser and less polished in the past century or so.

A Rudigaya’s Best Friend: The first ten folios are written in formal Rudishva Glyphik, and describe a score of plots conceived by Rudiga and his friends that were then carried out against the heqeti and other enemies. The remainder of the text is in Semi-glyphik, and describes centuries’ worth of secrets, plots, counterplots, and betrayals relating to the period of Archontean hegemony in Arden Vul. Readers of this tome gain a +1 bonus on to hit and damage rolls against heqeti.

### Kerbog Khan

* A brilliant Khumus sorcerer who came to Archontos decades ago as a youth, joining the Nova Schola Auctoritatis after a bravura display of natural talent before the masters.
* He eventually stole several highly valuable tomes and fled, with rumors and sightings placing him western Thorcinga, in the vague area of Arden Vul.
* Kerbog is trying to emulate to himself, crudely, what the rudishva once were, becoming cybernetic.  It seems much more intriguing that lichedom.

### Craastonistorex

Craastonistorex, huge very old green dragon: SZ L; AL LE; AC 2; MV 90’, 240’ flying; HD 9; HP 63; #AT 3; Dmg 1-6/1-6/2-20. Continual abilities: infravision; detect hidden or invisible (70’); talking (Archontean, Elvish, Thorcin). Special attacks: breath weapon (gas); fear aura (+1 to saves). Special defenses: saves as a 15 HD monster. Spells: identify, protection from good, read magic, shield; darkness 15’ radius, ESP, invisibility. 

Goals
* Has the beginnings of a fair hoard, pillaging what he can find and stealing what he can take.
* Canny and inquisitive, he uses his fear aura to interogate sentient creatures in the area.
* He'll learn of the PCs arrival within 2 days, and will watch the characters for another couple of days before introducing himself, choosing an advantageous time and place (e.g., when a wounded party is exiting the halls)for a dramatic appearance.
	* Speaking politely but firmly, and likely pursues one of the following strategies: 1) if the PCs are powerful, simply warn them not to interfere in his hunting; 2)  magnanimously allow them to carry away whatever spoils they can find in the dungeons with a 50% tithe; 3) bully the PCs into serving him, perhaps eliminating a rival or by locating a particular object.
* He will make occasional reappearances so as to keep the PCs on their toes.

Relations with others:
* Tufwillig: aware of a ‘force of nature’ in the area, but not Tuftwillig specifically. If aware, he will plot Tuftwillig’s demise.
* Kronos Kettle-Belly and Estelle (AV-22): They entrepreneurs act with respect towards him,  providing a weekly offering of game to the dragon.  Unknown to Kronos, Estelle has also been providing curative and information services in lieu of a monetary tribute.
	* Each month there is a 10% cumulative chance, however, that Craastonistorex begins to demand the more traditional tribute.
* Galeth, Master of the Long House (AV-43): a bit intimidated by Galeth’s evil and age, and avoids him. In the right circumstances, the wyrm might trade information about Galeth in return for valuables.
* The Cult of Set: Stephania the high priestess (4-51) pays a tribute of 100 sp per month to ensure that her minions remain unmolested.  As Craastonistorex grows older, he will wish to change the terms of this bargain in his favor.
	* He knows who the cultists at AV-44 are, having tortured and eaten several.
* Deino and the Beastmen: he has only heard of Deino.  She recently refused to pay tribute, and he now hunts the beastmen when he can find them.
* Lizardmen: rarely venture to the top of the cliff, and always offer small, but symbolic, gifts to the wyrm.  Craastonistorex mostly ignores them.
* Trollkin (EX-5): they are terrified of the wyrm but, as they have little treasure, Craastonistorex mostly ignores them. If pressed he will confess that they taste ‘a little off.’
* Knights of the Azure Shield: perceived to be his greatest threat.  He might try to persuade PCs of the knights’ ‘untrustworthiness’ and of the danger they pose ‘to equilibrium in the valley’. He might ally to oppose the knights (leaving the hard work to the PCs). Those publicly allied with the knights, find him to be a permanent and implacable foe.
