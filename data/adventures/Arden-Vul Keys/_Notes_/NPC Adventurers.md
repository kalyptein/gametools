* Three sets of statistics for each group are offered: for low level (levels 1-3), middle levels (levels 4-7), and high levels (levels 8-10).

Some NPC groups also may be encountered as a fixed encounter in certain parts of the Halls 
(e.g., the Bad Neighbors, at 6-113 and 6-129). If such a group is indicated in the random table, the GM may wish to select a different group in order to preserve the integrity of the fixed encounter for that group. Of course the GM could always substitute one of the random parties for a group indicated as a fixed encounter.
