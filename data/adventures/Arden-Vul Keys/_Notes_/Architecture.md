## General Construction Features

#### Heqeti

* First to delve within Arden Vul. arriving from the Underearth ~3,600 years ago.
* Erected the colossal ziggurat of Kauket within the mephitic marsh (10-15) and colonized the floor of the Great Chasm (i.e., Level 9).
* Limited delving of upper Great Chasm, including the pukel-manders, the Obsidian Gates (5-6D), the Hall of Forty Pillars (5-6), and an upper temple to Kauket (7-79).
* Driven from Arden Vul twice, first by the rudishva in 32 AEP, later by the Archonteans in 1942 AEP. 
* Returned 300 years ago (2682 AEP) and restored the ziggurat.

Stonework
* Most heqeti construction is ancient, dating to the period between 32 and 1942 AEP.
* Surfaces are worked (with hand tools), but not smoothed; leaving a pebbled, bumpy texture, treated with special, non-lethal slime giving these surfaces an oily, greasy feel. 

Doors
* Doors are stone and typically unlocked

Ceiling Height
* 10’, unless otherwise indicated

Sculpture and Art
* Infrequent carving of statuary and relief images.  typically of the struggle against their enemies and/or images of their great dread lords, Kauket and Rimmaq-Isfet.
* Their art has a heavy, oppressive feel, such as in the great pukel-manders.

Locations
* Mention should be made of the pukel-manders scattered throughout the upper levels. 
* 2-48, 2-49, 2-56C
* 3-51, 3-117
* 4-51A, 4-51B, 4-74, 4-151A, 4-152
* 5-6, 5-18, 5-25, 5-41, 5-42, 5-46 to 5-49, 5-52, 5-104
* 6-1, 6-50, 6-51, 6-54, 6-68, 6-92 to 6-98, 6-104 to 6-107
	* Areas 6-41 to 6-43 and 6-55 to 6-91 were originally heqeti, but have been repurposed over the millennia and lost some of the pebbling and most of the oiliness of typical heqeti chambers.
* 7-78 to 7-84, 7-138, 7-139
* 8-25, 8-26, 8-76, 8-159, 8-162, 8-165
* 9-31 to 9-48, 9-76 to 9-82, 9-108 to 9-126
* all worked areas of Level 10
* SL5-32, SL5-36 to SL5-42
* SL6-4, SL6-6, SL6-35
* SL9-27, SL9-30.

#### Rudishva

* The rudishva arrived in 32 AEP when their starship, the Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven (aka, the Beacon), crashed into the cliff, its matter-phased pieces scattered at various depths. 
* Once it was clear that rescue was not imminent and that the Beacon would never fly again, the rudishva began constructing permanent dwellings. They drove the heqeti from the upper reaches of the Great Chasm and established a base on what is now Level 5, locating it behind the ancient heqeti Obsidian Gates. These dwelling were connected to the surviving modules of the Beacon by a network of teleportation nodes.
* As the years of exile turned into decades and the heqeti resistance stiffened, the rudishva established breeding nests for the varuda and growth tanks for the varumani (the Troll Pits, 5-132). With these additional forces, the rudishva went to war against the heqeti and drove them from Arden Vul (77 AEP)
* Over the next century, the rudishva expanded into other portions of the halls, delving new halls on Level 9 and elsewhere while hegemony scientists attempted to engineer a new propulsion formula for their shuttle craft (SL13-37).
* During these years, the heqeti returned in secret to Arden Vul. Allying themselves with the traitorous kaliyani, the heqeti launched a surprise attack on the rudishva hegemony in 193 AEP; the heqeti slimes were deadly, and wiped out the rudishva, the varuda, and half of the varumani. The rudishva halls have remained unoccupied ever since.  

Stonework
* Modernistic, ‘clean’ style in which right angles were absent.
	* Chambers and halls have rounded corners and no ninety-degree angles; rendering corridors tunnel-like and chambers ovoid.
* The surfaces are typically sheathed in hexagonal tiles of highly polished marble, pure white or dark black; fit together perfectly without grout lines (thanks to the advanced mining and cutting tools available to the rudishva).

Doors
* 8’-diameter oval dilating irises made of grey plasteel.
	* A 6" tall oval panel is set in the wall on the right side of the door; this panel flickers with a colored light that runs successively through the color spectrum.
* Each door was originally installed with security protocols that allowed only those crewmen of a particular rank to open the door.
	* A rudishva identity plaque (new tech) of the correct color must be placed against the panel, at which point the plasteel irises open.

Ceiling Height
* 12’, unless otherwise indicated

Sculpture and Art
* The rudishva did not typically adorn public areas with sculpture or painting, so most of the ancient areas connected to the survivors of the Beacon are featureless. A few exceptions exist, especially in areas connected with the kaliyani, as the kaliyani culture did favor sculptural art (see below). 
* One important exception is the Midnight Road itself (5-91), along which runs a kaliyani-inspired frieze of complex, kinetic sculpture of writhing figures surrounded by floral and geometric patterns. 

Locations
* 3-39
* 4-156, 4-157, 4-158

* SL13-37 to SL13-39
* SL14-6 to SL14-14

#### Varumani

* The varumani survivors fled the collapse of the rudishva hegemony in 193 AEP. After wandering in the middle levels for several decades, they finally settled into a series of caves halfway down the Great Chasm (Level 7).
* Over the following centuries they developed a powerful, if insular, society centered around the four clan-holds (7-17, 7-18, 7-25 and 7-26), the thegn’s court (7-75), the audience hall (7-27), their ‘great pit’ (7-32), and a trading center known today as the Troll Market (7-76). * As befit security personnel on the Beacon, the modern varumani have labored to ensure that entrance to their halls is protected by a handful of choke-points. Aside from the system of troll lifts developed close to 500 years ago, the varumani have seen little reason to expand beyond their carefully-guarded hold.

Stonework
* The varumani halls feature carefully-worked and polished native stone (granite, mostly).

Doors
* Varumani doors mimic Archontean ones; that is, they are formed of wood with iron bands for extra support.

Ceiling Height
* Varumani ceilings are 10’ high unless otherwise indicated.

Sculpture and Art
* Influenced by long centuries as tributaries to the human archons, varumani art is clearly modelled on Archontean forms and styles. It includes brightly painted walls, life-sized statues, the occasional fresco representing a thegn or some heroic feat of arms, etc. In terms of quality, though, varumani sculptors and painters are more enthusiastic than skilled.

Locations
* 7-1, 7-8 to 7-33, 7-65 to 7-77

#### Archontean

* The Archonteans arrived at Arden Vul in the century after two Archontean heroes, Arden the Defender and Vul the Sorcerer, ‘discovered’ the area in 829 AEP.
* The surface city was chartered by imperial decree in 893 AEP, and, seeking arcanum and ancient artifacts and knowledge, the Archonteans began delving into the subterranean areas shortly thereafter.
	* The powerful and wealthy temples of Thoth and Set were major pioneers in this effort, together developing much of Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and Sub-Levels 2, 3 and 8.
	* Building projects sponsored by the (secular) imperial administration were responsible for developing sections of Levels 6, 7, 8, and 9, and Sub-Levels 4, 6, 7, and 13. 
	* Individual Archontean officials also developed tombs and other hidden retreats throughout the complex; two of the most significant were the famous tombs of the Drowned Canyon (SL6) and the almost unknown tomb of Isadora (SL11).
 
Stonework
* The quality of Archontean masonry is generally high, with neatly trimmed native walls covered (originally) in plaster. Most plastered surfaces were painted with bright colors, with some carrying painted frescoes appropriate to the purpose of their chamber.

Doors
* Doors are wood, with iron bands for support.

Ceiling Height
* 10’ unless otherwise indicated.

Sculpture and Art
* The ancient Archonteans favored representational art. As a result, important public chambers were typically plastered and then either painted with frescoes depicting scenes appropriate to the function of the chamber, or painted simply in a vibrant color. Sculpture was typically highly realistic, taking either the form of free-standing statues or of relief sculptures of varying depth.
* Modern Archontean art is frequently less realistic, although still representational, favoring wispy, elongated, ethereal depictions of idealized persons; it is typically found only in those areas occupied by the failed expedition of Adrienic (e.g., 5-15, 5-16, 5-19 to 5-24, etc.).
* It is possible for a viewer well-versed in ancient iconography to deduce the builders and purposes of individual chambers from the garb of figures depicted in frescoes: regions  built by the priesthood of Thoth, for instance, will include images of priests in tall cylindrical headdresses and heavy vestments (in orange), as well as repeated use of ibis, baboon, and other appropriate images.

#### Kaliyani

* Arriving in modern Arden Vul some twenty-one years ago (in 2972 AEP), Tsilliv’s band of renegades have developed a small consortium in the kaliyani style on Sub-Level 9.
* While they are eager to locate traces of their former presence in Arden Vul, they have so far been unwilling to expand beyond the well-guarded precincts of their new consortium.

Stonework
* The kaliyani are expert stone carvers. Walls, ceilings and floors within the consortium are neatly worked, and all feature the distinctive “no 90-degree angles” style inherited from the ancient rudishva days.
* As noted below, the kaliyani prefer to carve low-relief sculptures into all stone surfaces, including floors (although they may place mats atop such carved floors to protect the ceremonial carvings).

Doors
* oval in the tradition of the ancient rudishva dilating iris doors.  Made of stone, and do not require identity plaques or high-technology to open.  Rarely equipped with locking mechanisms (an exception is SL9-73); most can be pushed or pulled open easily.

Ceiling Height
* Ceilings are 15’ tall unless otherwise indicated.

Sculpture and Art
* for public areas, the kaliyani favor busy, low-relief sculpture that covers every square inch of walls, floors and ceilings. The subject matter of such sculpture is typically kinetic, depicting kaliyani (and other allies) writhing in contest with foes; surrounding and interspersed among the action are floral and geometric images (e.g., 6-32, 6-33, SL9-60 to SL9-63, SL9-66, etc.).
* Private quarters are typically left uncarved. The kaliyani do produce statues, but rarely; their statues are designed to enhance the glory of a consortium, and are placed accordingly.

Locations
* SL9-60 to SL9-77
