## The Underclock

- Start with a count of 20.  Each interval, subtract 1d6, exploding to 1d6-1.
	- Count < 0: encounter occurs, reset clock to 20
	- Count = 0: set clock to 3 (a sign happens)
	- Count = 3: sign of impending encounter occurs
- Notes
	- Average of 5.9 Underclock rolls before an encounter.  0.3% chance of an immediate encounter (enough exploding rolls to go from 20 to encounter immediately).
	- About 33% of encounters have a sign beforehand.

## Encounter Distance

* No surprise (dungeon): 2d6 x 10 feet (limited by sight)
	* Both surprised: 3d6 feet
	* One side surprised: 4d6 feet
* No surprise (outdoors): 4d6 x 10 feet (limited by sight)
	* Either side surprised: 1d4 x 10 feet

## Reaction

* 2-) attack
* 3-5) hostile, may attack
* 6-8) uncertain, confused
* 9-11) indifferent, may negotiate
* 12+) eager, friendly

## Morale

* 2d6 > morale rating (ML 12 never fails)
	* Situational Modifiers: -2 to +2
	* Failed: surrender or flee
* Check
	* On side's first death (group) / first harmed (solo)
