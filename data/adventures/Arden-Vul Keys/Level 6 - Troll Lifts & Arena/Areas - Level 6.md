### Overview

Level 6 is known to the denizens of Arden Vul for three main attractions, the Troll Lifts (6-1 to 6-5), the Inn of the Lost (6-7 to 6-20) and the Arena (6-55 to 6-94). Each of these areas is potentially a place of peace, as each plays an important role in the political and social lives of the intelligent factions of Arden Vul. Those who visit any of these three locations with open arms instead of unsheathed weapons can be assured of a neutral reception and relative security, for the inhabitants of these three regions enforce peace and security with an iron hand. The regions that surround these three islands of relative peace are, however, quite deadly, and include several extremely dangerous locations: the Lock Cavern with its oozes and deranged Sun-Scarred Knight (6-39), the domain of the Frost Mother (6-137 to 6-142), the slime-choked Crew Quarters of the Beacon (6-113 to 6-124), and the lost tomb of the Archontean hero, Marius Tricotor (6-154). The Great Chasm (6-108) allows travel up to level 5 and down to level 7.

General Construction Notes
* Heqeti areas: 6-1, 6-50, 6-51, 6-54, 6-92 to 6-98, 6-104 to 6-107. 
	* Areas 6-41 to 6-43 and 6-55 to 6-91 were also originally heqeti areas; they have been repurposed over the millennia, and have thus lost some of the pebbling and most of the oiliness of typical heqeti chambers.
* Rudishva areas: 6-4, 6-5, 6-27 to 6-38, 6-95A, 6-99, 6-100, 6-102, 6-103, 6-109 to 6-111, 6-113 to 6-124, 6-162 to 6-164 
* Archontean areas: 6-7 to 6-16, 6-18 to 6-20, 6-40, 6-44 to 6-49, 6-52, 6-53, 6-130 to 6-160

Significant Regions of Level 6

The Troll Lifts (areas 6-1 to 6-5, 6-50)
* The Troll Lifts provide a means of traveling up and across the Great Chasm (6-108). The Lifts themselves are essentially large baskets attached to ropes and pulleys, which giant bestial varumani hoist up and down under the direction of a true varumani overseer. On Level 6, the Lifts provide access up to Level 5 (at 6-3), down to Level 7 (at 6-5), down to Level 8 (at 6-1), and across the chasm itself (at 6-1, 6-4, and 6-5). Each lift is operated by an overseer appointed by the troll thegn (7-30). Fares are fixed by the thegn at 10 sp per leg per voyage, although some overseers extort a bit more from weak travelers.
* Factions
	* The varumani own and operate the Lifts. An attack on any of the Lifts constitutes an assault against the varumani people. None of the other factions would dream of challenging varumani authority here.
* Construction
	* 6-1 and 6-50 were originally of heqeti construction
	* 6-2 to 6-5 were built by the rudishva. No doors in this region, 10’-12’ tall ceilings.
* Environment
	* The region is moist, humid, and noisy thanks to the waterfalls at areas 6-6A and 6-6B


The Inn of the Lost (6-7 to 6-20, 6-28)
* A functioning inn, with guest-rooms, kitchen, and a common room, occupies a suite of ancient Archontean administrative offices. Formerly known as the House of Isocorax, the area is now more commonly referred to as the Inn of the Lost.
* The current innkeeper, Thegan White-Mane (6-19), has proclaimed that the Inn defines a zone of peace, within which other grudges, disputes, and feuds must be put aside; this zone commences at the ‘Peace Door’ (6-7A) and includes all rooms in the Inn. Not surprisingly, the inn has become a place of refuge for those fleeing from more powerful enemies (i.e., ‘the lost’). 
* Beneath the veneer of peace and understanding, however, Thegan carefully maintains several deep, dark secrets. A small band of traders gathers in a chamber (6-28) near the inn; although not formally under the protection of the Inn’s peace zone, long custom has ensured that this area, too, is one in which enmities are laid aside. Thegan makes good use of the traders’ connections outside Arden Vul, especially so as to ensure his continued access to rastite lotus powder (see new flora), which he trades to Deino (3-158).
* Factions
	* None of the main factions controls the Inn. Thegan receives the mostly tacit, but occasionally explicit, support of the other factions, including the varumani thegn (7-30), the goblin king (SL4-22), the Lord of the Arena (6-85), and even the beastmen (see 3-138 to 3-162).
* Construction
	* Typical Archontean construction. With the exception of the Peace Door (6-7A), which is highly enchanted, other doors are new-ish models of wood with iron bands. Most have functioning locks, the keys to which either are found at reception (6-7), or in the hands of Thegan (6-19) or Justin the Nose (6-7, 6-9A). Ceilings are 10’ tall.
* Environment
	* An ancient anti-magic shell covers the chambers of the Inn; spell-casting does not work within the shell, unless one possesses one of the rings of higher purpose (see new magic items).

The Domain of the Arena Lord (6-55 to 6-94)
* This region is centered around an ancient heqeti gladiatorial arena, one that has seen consistent use by successive civilizations for almost 4,000 years. Today the Arena is operated by one of the apparently ageless rudishva survivors, a being known only as ‘the Lord of the Arena’ (6-85).
* The Arena Lord rules his domain with an iron fist and strict neutrality; those visiting the Arena are expected to abide by the general rules, which forbid physical altercations of any sort other than those taking place in the Arena itself. 
* Access to the Arena is easy, whether from the Troll Lifts or through corridors leading to the other major centers of intelligent habitation in the Halls (e.g., 6-65 through 6-67). 
* The Arena provides an important economic function within the halls: the Lord pays well for monsters and slaves, and offers a convenient means for the newly rich to spend their winnings.
* Factions
	* This region constitutes its own lesser faction. The leaders of the other factions appreciate the entertainment and economic role the Arena plays and are hence uninterested in efforts to eliminate the arena or its Lord.
* Construction
	* Most of the stonework of the main areas of the region is very old, dating to the heqeti period. Due to millennia of occupation and modification by successor civilizations, however, the usual pebbled, oily nature of heqeti stonework is less pronounced here. Area 6-95A is of rudishva construction. Doors are standard wooden doors. Ceilings, unless otherwise stated, are 10’ tall.
* Environment
	* The area is humid and hot due to the high density of inhabitation.

Former Archontean Administrative Offices and Shrines (6-136 to 6-160)
* West of the chasm the Archonteans built a series of administrative offices, shrines, and tombs, including those of Marius Tricotor, the great archon, and Lucius Cornelius, his biographer.
* Factions
	* None of the intelligent factions controls this region, and none see much reason to explore here, both because of the dangers posed by the Frost Mother (6-136) and because of the (erroneous) perception that there is little of value to be found here.
* Construction
	* Stonework is typical of the Archontean era. Doors are wood, with iron bands; due to their age, they are easier to burst open (+1 to chances to open doors). The north side of the door at 6-136 is rimmed with frost and cold to the touch. Ceilings are 10’.
* Environment
	* Most of the region is cool and dry. The areas controlled by the Frost Mother (6-136 to 6-142), however, are bone cold (20 degrees F) and covered with drifts of frost and snow.

## Level 6: 1 - 6

### 6-1: Eastern Troll Lift

* This impressive hall is home to one cog in the extensive Troll Lift system owned and operated by the varumani. 
	* It was carved by the heqeti millennia ago, and the pebbled walls are slightly oily to the touch and detect faintly of evil. 
	* The floor is paved with blue granite. 
	* 2 weathered statues of largely shapeless, crouching bipeds flank a platform extending into the chasm. 
		* Their aura is still menacing and vaguely evil. 
		* The southeastern statue has a cavity, holding 2 tears of Kauket (new).   Recovering them would require destroying the statue; Reith is unlikely to approve of this.
		* The official fare-chest (locked) is located at the foot of the southern statue.
			* 1,188 sp, 574 gp; Reith’s silver baton of authority (250 gp); a scroll with detect magic, and a wand of magic missiles with 3 charges.
	* The heqeti spy on the Troll Lift via a spyhole cleverly set into the southeastern wall.
		* They are situated in 6-51.  Reith is unaware of them.

* 1 in 6 chance another group is present in this chamber (roll below).
* When no travelers are present, the varumani are often lounging in their quarters (6-50). 

* A team of three varumani under the leadership of Junior Overseer Reith operates both the lift to Level 8 and the cross-chasm ferry between 6-2 and 6-3.
	* Those wishing to use the Troll Lift to descend the 400’ down to Level 8 must negotiate with Reith. 
	* The official tariff set by the troll thegn is 10 sp per leg for delivery from 6-1 to 8-1. 
	* Reith is too stupid to attempt graft or much else, thus he has been assigned to this spot in the Lift network, where he is unlikely to have to make decisions on the fly.

* The Troll Lift is composed of several parts:
	* A rectangular opening (10’x10’) in the pavement, a pair of 10’-tall iron poles on either side of the hole supporting a wooden frame over the hole, guy-lines extending from the side of the platform to the iron apparatus, a pair of iron cranks, over 450’ of heavy silk rope coiled around the upper portion of the apparatus, and an iron and wood cage which descends through the rectangular opening some 400’ to area 8-1 below.
* 2 bestial varumani crank the winch to raise or lower the cage. 
	* Passage up or down takes 11-20 minutes of swaying, creaking, and generally nauseating stops and starts of the cage.

Reith
* Reith is jocular, and enjoys teasing passengers about their goals and likely fates. 
* Any who ask about the Inn of the Lost are directed to 6-7A and immediately teased about the causes of their ‘flight’. 
* For all of that, Reith sees himself as a guardian of the Inn’s famous ‘peace’, and has a good working relationship with Thegan White-Mane. 
* If Thegan needs muscle, Reith and his boys will be summoned to help deal with any peace-breakers. 
* If asked about the thegn’s court or the Troll Market, Reith is 75% likely to remind them they need a passport to visit either location; he is 25% likely to have one for sale (300 gp).

	* He will not gossip about the thegn’s court.
	* He knows of the effects of both the lover’s aid and the green water (6-4), but only warns visitors who are respectful and deferential. He and his boys are quick to relieve any who succumb to either effect of their valuables.

		* Dirt and humus cover the structure.
		* The garden is lush and verdant, with a number of exotic, tropical species. Most are alien, resembling the following Irthuin species: mango trees, coconut palms, camellia-like shrubs, lianas, orchids, and ferns.
		* A wide variety of insect life fills the air with the sound of whirring and chirping.
	* A central ‘hill’ rises 15’ above the floor of the garden.  Paths of crushed pink granite wend through the garden, although none climb the ‘hill’. 
		* At its summit is a pool of warm, emerald green water.
			* Due to unusual minerals, it acts as a narcotic healing potion (heal 4d4, but fall into a blissful trance lasting 2d4 turns; movement is possible, but reaction times are slowed considerably and 50% chance of experiencing pleasant hallucinations). 
		* A heavy, circular hatch is concealed under a tuffet of moss (secret door).
			* Opens by spinning its wheel.  Inside is a metal ladder leading down to a ==storage room==.
	* A quasi-dangerous variety of orchid, the ==lover’s aid== (flora, 5 specimens), grows at the northwestern edge of the garden.
	* The underside of northern end of the garden houses a forgotten hangar, built into the stone and now concealed by hanging vines and mosses.
		* Inside is one of the few remaining rudishva hover-sleds (tech), fully charged.
			* Requires a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque to activate.
			* Only those inspecting the underside of the garden have a chance to spot this hangar.

Lover's Aid
* Smells of honeyed raspberries.  Breathing its scent (within 10’), makes ones highly susceptible to reasonable suggestions for 1-6 turns.
	* Aged Lishna, a courtier at the troll thegn’s court (7-75), knows of this plant and sometimes collects specimens for use in the affairs of court.

Storage Room
* A cramped stone chamber 5’ high, 5’ wide, and 10’ long, originally a storeroom for gardening tools.
	* Rudishva herbicide dispenser (11-30 doses) (tech)
* A pair of adventurers were inadvertently locked inside by colleagues drunk on narcotic water.  Some virulent fertilizers in the chamber dissolved their bodies, yielding a new "red pudding" which waits mindlessly for fresh food. 
	* Absorbed: 23 ancient silver pennies; 117 gp; 3 tourmalines (100 gp each); 6 stones of striking (7th-level, new); a badly tarnished silver torc of authority (new); a long sword; a mace; a black glass activation square and several bits of unidentifiable metal scraps.

1 red pudding (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 4; MV 30’; HD 10; HP 75; #AT 1; Dmg 2-16; MR 25%. Special attacks: bloody healing; corrodes leather, clothing, wood. Special 
defenses: immune to electricity and cold; slow regeneration.
* See notes in appendix for how, even if defeated, the red pudding might nevertheless spread into other areas of Arden Vul.

### 6-5: Western Troll Lifts

* This former rudishva observation chamber is now a key link in the Troll Lift network.
	* A cross-chasm ferry transports passengers to 6-3/6-4.
	* A lift carries visitors down 200’ to the thegn’s court (7-1).
	* Given its importance, the area is supervised by Overseer Gorlen, the true varumani supervisor of the entire Troll Lift network.  Two bestial varumani aid him.
		* Fares are standard, and Gorlen attempts no extortion: 5 sp per leg for travel to Level 7-1 (11-20 minutes) or passage to the floating garden (2 minutes). 
	* The lifts are constructed in the usual way (see 5-55, 6-2 and 6-3).
	* Gorlen has mounted heads of a goblin and a human on stakes near the Lift, and takes ghoulish pleasure in informing all travelers that ‘Such is the fate of those who cheat the thegn!’
* The chamber is noticeably cool (due to the frozen regions 6-137 to 6-142) and damp (due to waterfall spray).
	* A huge stone seat facing the floating garden dominates the chamber. 
		* Once enchanted, the glyphs of power on it were gouged out in antiquity.
		* The fare chest is next to the seat, in which Gorlen likes to lounge imperiously.
			* 2,731 sp, 829 gp; Gorlen’s gold baton of authority (510 gp); 2 vials of poison, a scroll of find traps, and a scroll of invisibility.
	* 2 staircases lead to the southwestern segment of the chamber, where the varumani keep a roaring fire stoked with whatever fuel they can find.
* Gorlen has rigged a wicker, rope, and leather gate across the arch to 6-136. 
	* He warns the curious about the terrible ‘icy monsters’ that live to the south but will admit that ‘some fancy tomb’ lies somewhere to the west. 
	* He charges 1 gp/person for entrance to the west.

Golen
* Gorlen has been charmed by Cinna Minux, the vampire lord (7-122), who visits him to learn about travelers on the Troll Lifts.

Gorlen, a true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword; ring mail; key to door in 6-136.

2 bestial varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 55, 49; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; immune to poison.

### 6-6: Waterfalls
##### 6-6a: First Waterfall

* The spillway from the Drowned Canyon (6-143) empties into the chasm here in a torrent of rushing water.
	* The spray is not as intense as it becomes further down the chasm.

##### 6-6B: Second Waterfall

* The waterfall from 5-2a pours down the chasm here in a zone of spray 20’ in diameter.

## Level 6: 7 - 20: The House of Isocorax, or The Inn of the Lost

* An Archontean administrative bureau in antiquity, this area was refurbished 750 years ago as an inn by the legendary figure known as Isocorax.
* Two principles motivated Isocorax: a) anyone was welcome at his inn; b) no violence would be tolerated within its walls.
	* These policies gave the inn its colloquial name, “The Inn of the Lost”; a place anyone could become lost / lose themself from past and/or enemies.
	* One firm exception to the Inn’s open door policy is enforced by all of the Inn’s staff: no Sun-Scarred Knight may stay the night, and only rarely will the proprietor allow one of the knights to drink in the common room.

* Although the Inn appears to possess no elaborate defenses, its role as a sanctuary has been, and continues to be, respected by all the major factions of Arden Vul.
	* All factions have been known to collaborate in tracking down and punishing any who break the peace of the Inn of the Lost.
	* This zone of ‘peace’ is widely understood to begin with the so-called peace door (6-7a), although most would also count the trading area of 6-28 as lying within this protected space.
	* It is not uncommon to find exiles, criminals, and those on the wrong end of a vendetta making a dash for the safety of the “peace door”.
		* While any are welcomed to the Inn and given security therein, that peace lasts only as long as one’s purse is full. Once the money runs out, guests are politely asked to leave, and will be bodily thrown out if necessary.
		* In the case of obstreperous guests, the proprietor may seek the assistance of Reith and his bestial assistants (6-1) to help in the expulsion.
* A sort of anti-magic shell operates throughout most of the Inn (areas 6-7 to 6-19).
	* Inherently magical items still work (e.g., continual light cast elsewhere and brought here, magic swords, etc), spell-casting does not.
	* Only those (like Justin the Nose) who wear one of the rings of higher purpose (new) are exempt from this effect.

* The proprietor is Thegan White-Mane, a muscular and hearty male human in his early 60s, with pure white hair, a few scars, and piercing grey eyes (for more, see 6-19).
	* Only a few of the oldest and most intelligent inhabitants of the halls remember that it was Isocorax who originally established and operated the Inn.
		* ‘Thegan’ has only been the proprietor for just over 200 years.
		* These denizens - among whom Deino (3-158), Varboka the troll thegn (7-30), Kerbog Khan (SL12-25), and the Lord of the Arena (6-85) - know that Isocorax was a rudishva and an original member of the Sun-Scarred Knights.
		* They assume that for his own obscure reasons, Isocorax invented the “Thegan” identity some 200 years ago.
			* The deeds and motives of Isocorax/Thegan intensely interest these faction-leaders, who might pay well for news of Thegan.
		* None who assume Thegan is Isocorax would divulge this information to mere adventurers, but they might mysteriously observe to those they favor that Thegan has been the only proprietor the Inn has ever had for about 200 years.
	* In reality, Isocorax is alive, but a prisoner of “Thegan” these past centuries.
		* “Thegan” is actualy Maurikios Ligareon, taxiarch of the 3rd Cohort of the Imperial Tagmata.
		* After his cohort was defeated 230 years ago during the disastrous imperial attempt to retake Arden Vul. Maurikios saved himself by drugging Isocorax and using the latter’s strange blood (see 6-20) to give him extraordinary longevity. 

* Thegan employs 12 staff, including:
	* 2 human barkeeps, 2 goblin cooks, 1 human and 1 beastman housekeeper, 2 human serving wenches, 3 guards/suppliers (1 lesser varumani, 1 goblin, 1 human), and Justin the Nose, the sacristan and Thegan’s chief assistant.
* The Inn sends its team of ‘suppliers’ on regular missions to buy supplies at both the Forum of Set (4-2) and the Troll Market (7-76).
	* These suppliers are shielded by the same peace as the Inn itself, at least among intelligent denizens.

* Those who annoy the factions leaders and escape to the Inn will be monitored.
	* A scout or two from the now-inimical faction lounges in the Common Room, watching, recording, and reporting, perhaps making the Inn a prison.
	* Factions may arrange for such enemies to be met with overwhelming force in the  halls outside the Peace Door when finally they leave.
* Thegan White-Mane is mostly content to play by the rules he created.  Occasionally he will abduct guests via his network of secret tunnels (see 6-19) to become nourishment for Isocorax (6-20).

### 6-7: Inn of the Lost, Reception

* This plain chamber is lit brightly by a continual light spell cast on the ceiling.
* A 10’-long counter of aged and polished mahogany runs along the center of the room.
	* Behind the desk sits Justin the Nose, the sacristan of the Inn, waiting to greet and register new guests.

	* This room is under the effect of the partial anti-magic effect (as from 6-7 to 6-19).
* Thegan White-mane is likely (75%) to be hanging around reception or the common room, and may greet new guests personally after Justin has registered them.

Rules
* Those seeking a meal or drinks are directed to the common room; those wishing a room should check for vacancy.
* Cash up front; early departures forfeit any remaining balance on a long-term stay.
* If new ‘guests’ are unruly or violent, Justin will warn them once.
	* If they remain disruptive or violent, he uses his wand of paralyzation to good effect and summons aid from the common room (6-8).
	* Any guests whom Justin (or others) is forced to subdue in this way are sold as slaves in the Forum of Set (4-7) or the Arena (6-68).

* Private Rooms (x7) 40% for 1, 20% for each additional

Thegan White-Mane (75%) (for stats, see 6-19)

##### 6-7a: Peace Door

* This heavy door is made of ironwood and is banded with steel. 
	* It is well oiled, opens easily, and detect as magical.
* A square sign made of oak is affixed the door (Mithric) “House of Isocorax.”
	* Below is neatly printed in white paint (Archontean): “Feeling Lost? Let our warm beds and delicious meals bring you back to the light. Welcome to the Inn of the Lost.”
* Assorted graffiti has been scrawled around these signs.
	* Most of which are paeans of thanks to Thegan (e.g., “My refuge for the past 2 months,” “Thanks, Thegan. I owe you everything!” and “Ha! Escaped those vengeful in-laws, didn’t I?”)
	* A few are desperate pleas for admittance (e.g., “Four days of flight, and the Peace Door is closed? Bastards!” and “So much for mercy! Dumped outside for my enemies to find.”)

* There is a 1 in 10 chance that Thegan has closed and locked the door.
	* Can be passed by a Knock spell or other such magics.
	* If locked, 50% chance that some unfortunate is groveling outside it, begging for admittance, and 20% chance that pursuers are 1d3 turns away from reaching the door and that unfortunate.

### 6-8: Common Room

* The common room is cool and dim, lit only by a pair of crystals mounted on the walls that emit low, blue-tinged light.
	* The bar to the northwest and low stage in the southern niche dominate the room.
		* The barkeeps are two:
			* A handsome, but rather dim human named Boots after the extravagant red, leather high-boots that he sports.
			* A sour, toothless crone named Dirty Betsy; she warms to any who attempt to charm her.
		* The wenches are named Lily and Theudelinda; they are kind but not stupid, and never cavort with guests.
		* Thegan likes to hire entertainers for a ‘season’ of 3-6 months.
			* Currently a fine Thorcin lutist, named Aethgrim Fleet-hand, is in residence.
				* He was an adventurer (T4) whose party was decimated in the Nether Reaches and who managed to convince Thegan to let him stay on as an entertainer.
				* Fleet-hand knows a lot of songs, and takes requests in return for a 1gp tip; when left to his own devices he specializes in flowery, classical laments and in murder ballads.
	* A dozen tables fill the main area, and several booths fill the northeastern corner. 
	* The east wall has a large wooden frame (10’x10’) with a canvas stretched over it.
		* Every year, Thegan replaces the canvas and invites artistic-minded guests to add images. Depending on the time of the year, there may be some interesting and potentially useful images on the canvas.
			* Usually, by December there are 3 imaginary monsters, 4 real monsters (15% chance of an architectural detail or caption to help locate the beast), 5 representations of locations (20% to identify, or 75% if the viewer has actually been there; 10% chance the image imparts some truly useful information, like a secret door), and 10-20 caricatures of guests of the Inn.
		* In front of the mural are a couple of large piss-pots (that are periodically emptied into the Great Chasm).

### 6-9: Guest Rooms

* These private rooms feature two bunkbeds, a dresser, a chest (without lock), a bistro table with two rickety chairs, and a stinky chamber pot (guests must empty their own pots, typically into the Great Chasm).
* Brackets in the walls permit torches, which customers must provide at their own expense.

##### 6-9a: Sacristan’s Quarters

* Thegan grudgingly gave Justin the Nose the quasi-permanent use of this chamber.

		* The chest is locked; the key is provided to those who pay for a week’s stay.
	* On the southwest wall is a 2’-wide, 4’-tall window which looks into the chasm.
		* Thick wooden shutters are attached to the window, allowing guests to protect themselves from chasm cephalopods and other nasties.
	* Secret Door (north): difficult to detect from this side (1 in 10), and -33% to pick.
		* For Thegan to pay nocturnal visits to guests he has selected for this ‘favor.’

### 6-11: Guest Rooms with a Twist

* These private rooms are identical to the others (6-9), save for the secret doors in the north walls (installed by Thegan).
	* Thegan won’t rent these rooms to those with keen sense, as he is worried they would detect the doors.
* Secret Door (north): difficult to spot (1 in 8), -25% to pick, Difficult.

	* Western (opens into the corridor): linens, torches, candles, loose bits of wood for bed repairs, and spare chamber pots.
		* Keys: Thegan, Justin the Nose, and the two housekeepers.
	* Eastern (opens onto the common room): crammed with foodstuffs, liquors, spare pots, and kitchen utensils.

		* The chefs and Justin the Nose know about this door, but have never been beyond it.
	* Secret Door (west): difficult to locate (1 in 8), opens when a stud located 7’ up the wall, just above the door, is pushed. 

### 6-16: Secret Cellar

* Opening the door pulls a tripwire, dumping a carboy of acid onto the opener (3d4 acid 1st round, 2d4 the 2nd, 1d4 the 3rd).
* Behind the secret door lie the mundane proceeds of centuries of Thegan’s selective thievery from guests at his Inn.
	* The ==treasure== is pushed to the sides of the chamber, spotlighting the beautiful painted scene inscribed in a 10’ circle in the middle of the floor.
		* Hunters and animals surrounding an archaic Archontean phlamoulon (military standard, an inverted triangle depicting a stag skull with the numeral III set into the forehead, and ‘Caveant hostes’ (‘Let enemies beware!’) written (in Mithric) to each side of the skull, along the side of the triangle.  This was the standard of the lost 3rd Cohort of the Imperial Tagmata, part of the forces sent to reclaim Arden Vul some 250 years ago. 
		* The painted phlamoulon is warded; if touched, it explodes (6d6 fire). The noise  brings Thegan at the run to investigate.

Treasure
* 6 elaborate silk carpets (from 5’x7’ to 12’x15’)
	* 4 have pastoral scenes (650 gp each).
	* 1 depicts Adrienic (named in a caption – see 5-18) directing Archontean soldiers against large, troll-like beings (the varumani) (800 gp).
	* 1 (the oldest) depicts the three obelisks of the city of Arden Vul (AV-5, AV-41, and AV-28), each with a prominent silver ankh on one face, as well as a set of stairs leading down to a pair of open doors (SL14-1) (1,150 gp).

* 2 glazed urns filled with coins
	* 17,890 sp in one; 9,431 gp in the other.
* 4 sturdy oak chests
	* Chest 1: a set of crystal goblets and decanters (250 gp); a golden candelabra (250 gp), and silver tableware for twelve (475 gp).
	* Chest 2: 10 vials and jars of valuable incense (65 gp each); 4 12”-tall, silver statuettes of dancing maidens (175 gp each); a yellow silk cape (25 gp); 3 6-lb ingots of solid gold (300 gp each); and a silk pouch with 15 moonstones (50 gp each)

	* Chest 4: 50 doses of Rastite lotus powder (flora); 15 doses of cloud cap mushrooms (flora); 5 doses of the red veil (flora); 5 lb of pepper; 2 lb of saffron.
		* Thegan trades the rastite lotus powder to Deino (3-158) for the golden mead he uses to keep Isocorax drugged (6-20).

Gethe, military-grade security construct
* This military-grade security construct is named Gethe, originally a counterpart to Relke (6-30).  It suffered a neural systems failure, stripping it of most of its fearsome capabilities.  Gethe has not been ‘charged’ in centuries.
	* Due to age and internal systems failures, there is a 5% cumulative chance per combat round that Gethe will suffer a catastrophic meltdown, destroying himself and inflicting 3d6 on all within 15’.
* Isocorax brought Gethe to the Inn and fruitlessly tried to repair it.
	* It recognizes Thegan and Isocorax as its masters.
	* It has been ordered to defend this chamber as best it can; mentioning Isocorax causes it to stand down.
* Kerbog Khan mikght be able to restore him to full functionality (see SL12-28).

Gethe, malfunctioning military-grade rudishva security construct (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 3, MV 120’; HD 10; HP 50; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8/3-8 (fists); MR 50%. Special Defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; leap unerringly 30’; regenerate 2 HP/round.

### 6-17: Cave

* The iron door to the west is locked, and only Thegan holds its key.
* The cavern is natural with a floor covered in a neat layer of sand.
	* The ‘sand’ is actually finely ground bone fragments from the hundreds of victims of Thegan and Isocorax.  One treading on the ‘sand’ will realize there is something unusual about it.  It lacks the usual moisture and compression typical of cave sand.
* It is empty save for a pair of unlit torches in wall brackets, and a battered wooden chair.
	* The chair is actually an inteligent mimic, fed by Thegan with leftover corpses in return for its service as guard.
* Secret Door (east): easy to locate (1 in 4), opens by pushing a rocky protuberance.

1 intelligent mimic: SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 30’; HD 7; HP 43; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: glue. Special defenses: perfectly mimic stone or wood.

### 6-18: Bunk Room

* The room is dark, and smells slightly from years of sweat.
* The Inn’s bunkroom is crowded with fourteen triple bunkbeds arranged in rough rows.
	* The Inn’s staff permanently occupies the four bunks closest to the corridor; ten more bunkbeds are open to guests.
	* Three footlockers lie under each bunk, but wise guests sleep on top of their valuables or pay Justin the Nose extra to keep them safe in his chamber. 
		* The Inn staff keep 3-60 sp in each of their footlockers.
* The north wall has fragments of an ancient Archontean fresco depicting an imperial legion advancing against hopping amphibians (heqeti).
* Secret Door (west): difficult to locate (1 in 8), -20% to pick.

### 6-19: Proprietor’s Room

* The door from the main hallway is locked (-10% to pick).
* Thegan White-Mane lives here in this luxurious apartment.
	* The chamber is carpeted with 3 plush, exotic rugs (8’x12’, non-pictorial, 350 gp).
	* A large four-poster bed against the western wall
		* Under the bed is a ==chest== (locked).
		* A small, ==iron box== (locked) is affixed to the underside of the bed. 
	* A heavy oak desk and a pair of easy chairs
	* A wine rack with 12 bottles (a fine vintage of Mithruin’s best, 100 gp each).
	* A rack holding Thegan’s armor and weapons.
		* Imperial field plate (av items); spear +3; short sword +3.
* Mounted on the south wall is the original battle standard, or phlamoulon, of the 3rd Cohort of Imperial Tagmata.
	* 50 gp alone; returned to an Archontean official (e.g. exarch of Narsileon, the taxiarch of one of the current tagmata, or any strategos) it would bring 5,000 gp and instant fame and favor.
* Secret Door (west): difficult to detect (1 in 8), pressing a floor stud unlocks it and allows it to he pushed open. The door is ancient and rarely used by Thegan.
* Secret Door (south): the lower part of the door pushes inward. This door is newer.

* Thegan is (25%) present here; otherwise he is present in 3-7.
	* If present, Thegan is likely drinking wine by himself (75%) while quietly singing ancient Archontean songs; those who eavesdrop may notice that he sings in an archaic form of Archontean.
	* If he hears the sound of combat in the Inn, he immediately bursts forth to confront the troublemakers (50% chance he stops to put on his imperial plate armor first).

Chest
* 5 5-lb bars of platinum (1,250 gp each); 619 sp; 231 gp
* Red robes appropriate to a high priest of Set, wrapped carefully in a canvas sack (75 gp)
* 5 doses of Rastite lotus powder (see new flora), carefully packaged in a leather satchel
* A finely-decorated blackware vase depicting the deeds of an archaic hero named Lidric on one side, and his burial in a tomb set in the wall of a cave, guarded by two pillars, on the other (see 5-16; 375 gp)
* A pair (blue and white) of glass activation squares
* The relic of an ancient Thorcin hero, Alger the Spearman, in the form of his skeletal left hand sealed inside a gold-chased mail mitten inscribed with his name (390 gp for the gold; 7,500 gp to a Thorcin chieftain (Thegan does not know the history of the relic).

Iron box
* Ring of higher purpose (new)
* A troll thegn’s passport (av items)
* A rust rudishva identity plaque (tech)
* Thegan’s diary (reveals his story and the location of Isocorax) 
* An account by a certain Cinna (Cinna Minux, 7-122)
	* Describes how Cinna followed a varumani warrior, Janara, to Level 9 and slew a band of heqeti about to ambush Janara, saving her life.  This account runs counter to the story that Janara is telling at the court of the troll thegn (7-75), and could discredit Janara, affecting varumani politics.  Thegan holds it for future leverage.


Thegan White-Mane, aka Maurikios Ligareon

Thegan’s Night Visits
* Thegan is a thoroughly evil man. To prolong Isocorax’s miserable existence, and his own life, he periodically abducts (usually from the guest rooms accessible via secret passage, 6-19A) guests who have run out of money and appear weak.
	* Base 10% chance any PCs below level 5 might become a target.
* Thegan might also decide to steal from a guest.
	* He is drawn only to impressive art objects - vases, rugs, small statues, jewelry, and the like; Archontean-era military artifacts are a particular weakness.

Thegan’s Backstory
* “Thegan” is a pseudonym of Maurikios Ligareon, second-in-command of the 3rd Cohort.
* When the imperial expedition faltered, Maurikios fled to the House of Isocorax for shelter.
* Unfortunately for Isocorax, Maurikios was able to get the drop on him and imprison him in one of the secret cellars of Isocorax’s own house (6-20).
* Maurikios has used the blood of Isocorax to prolong his own life and assume Isocorax’s role in the Halls.

Thegan’s Relationships
* On good terms with Varboka, the troll thegn (7-30), and the Lord of the Arena (6-85).
* He tolerates King Weskenim (SL4-22) and the goblins, but only barely.
* He has complicated feelings towards Deino (3-158).
	* He hates her for what she has done to his former comrades in arms.
		* This is on public display.  He is quick to rebut any who publicly praise the witch (33% chance of kicking such persons out of the Inn permanently).
		* He feels sharp compassion for ordinary beastmen, and is likely to protect deserters from the konturbia.
	* But he supplies her with Rastite lotus powder (6-17; new) necessary for her soporific golden mead; which she supplies to him to keep Isocorax drugged and incapacitated.
* Thegan loathes the Sun-Scarred Knights, fearing that they know (or will find out) of his treatment of Isocorax.
* Thegan fears the ghost of Gennadius (8-41).

Changes in the event of Thegan’s Death
* Seemingly one of the most stable and powerful factors in the politics of the Halls.
* Should his evil be discovered (e.g., abduction of guests), custom at the Inn will dry up, and the other factions’ previously fond affection towards him will evaporate.
* If he cannot get golden mead from Deino (with her death, or permanent disruption of his trade routes, see 6-28), Isocorax would swiftly escape, and likely kill Thegan.
	* Isocorax might re-open his house, but with new staff; all alliances would need to be reforged.
* If both Thegan and Isocorax are killed, a new innkeeper would be sponsored by the Varboka, the troll thegn (7-30), to maintain a ‘neutral’ site in the Middle Halls.
	* The new Innkeeper could be Justin the Nose, or someone new.
	* The secret doors would be disabled and prices would rise 33%.  The troll thegn acts as silent partner, but otherwise the Inn resumes normal operations.

Thegan White-Mane, aka Maurikios Ligareon, male Arch-ntean dual-classed 7th-level fighter, 10th-level thief: SZ M; AL LE; AC 3, or -1 in armor; MV 120’ or 90’; HD 10; HP 82; #AT 1; Dmg 4-7 (dagger +2), 5-10 (spear +3, short sword +3). Abilities: STR 16, INT 15, WIS 11, DEX 17, CON 15, CHA 13. Thief Skills: PP 85%, OL 77%, F/RT 65%, MS 83%, HS 68%, HN 30%, CW 99%, RL 50%.
* Possessions while within the Inn: dagger +2; bracers of defense (AC 6); brooch of confident action (see new magic items); a tooth of pol (see new magic items); keys to 6-7A, 6-15, 6-17, 6-20, and his chest and lockbox; and a skeleton key that fits all the guest-room doors in the Inn.
* Extra possessions when outside the Inn: imperial field plate; spear +3; short sword +3.

##### 6-19a: Secret Passage and Secret Doors

* Thegan’s network of secret passages and doors runs along the western side of the Inn, and is accessed from areas 6-19 and 6-20.
* The passages are5’ wide and 6’ tall; the doors are stone, worked to resemble the walls into which they debouch. 
	* Secret Doors (to 6-10, 6-11, 6-12, and 6-18): difficult to locate from the guest-room sides (locked, -20% to pick).  Obvious to locate (1 in 3, +10% to pick) from the secret passageways. 
	* Secret Door (to 6-108): opens with a key (held by Thegan). 
	* Secret Door (to west wall of 6-19): opens by inserting a 1”-diameter rod into a hole on the wall.
	* Secret Door (to south wall of 6-19): easy to detect (1 in 4), opens with a key held by Thegan. +10% to pick from this side.

### 6-20: Prison of Isocorax

* This chamber holds Thegan’s deepest secret, the prison of Isocorax, the rudishva Sun-Scarred Knight and source of Thegan’s incredible longevity.
	* Eastern Section
		* The ceiling is only 7’ tall and the walls are rough-hewn rock. 
		* The area is jammed with the fruits of centuries of plunder, both from the Nether Reaches (Level 8) and guests at the Inn.
			* Some of these objects are utilitarian but well-constructed - wooden bed-frames, chairs, armoires, etc. - and some are priceless.
			* 3 wooden desks, 12 goblin-sized, wooden side chairs, a disassembled sleigh bed, and a rather uncomfortable settee (1d4 x 10 gp each).
			* A rosewood escritoire with ivory inlay (175 gp); a teak settee with an embroidered cushion showing the pyramid of Thoth (AV-15) (140 gp); and a cherry and walnut chest of drawers, with solid gold drawer pulls (225 gp).
			* A 5’ statue of an Archontean strategos (general), with a carved ivory head (550 gp, 150 lb); a 3’ bronze statue of a spearman (600 gp, 75 lb); a cylindrical ivory waste-basket depicting dragons being ridden by warriors (425 gp); a 5’x18’ tapestry depicting the Ninth Labor of Arden (Singing the Dead to Sleep – see SL13-10I, 325 gp); a 4’x20’ tapestry depicting the triumphs of Marius Trictotor (see 6-154; 275 gp); and a collection of 6 carved-ivory-and-teak walking sticks showing animals, plant life, and Archontean soldiers (75 gp each).
	* Central Section
		* This area is of worked stone with a 10’ ceiling.
		* A 4’-tall, heavy wooden table stands in the center; obvious bloodstains and thick leather restraints are evident.
			* Under the table is a wooden box holding a collection of very sharp torture implements.
		* 2 manacles are set in the wall, with prisoners languishing, waiting to be fed to Isocorax: a human (Gib) and goblin (Posson).
		* On the north wall is a locked door to 6-20A (key held by Thegan).
		* An 8’-diameter iron grating (locked) in the floor lies just west of the door.
			* 2 heavy marble statue bases sit atop it to prevent forcing from below.
			* The hole descends 400’ via several ledges and landings to the Nether Reaches (8-33). A supple rope ladder (100') of elven rope (new) lies coiled by the hole and attached to a pair of thick iron staples.
				* Descent without the rope ladder requires 5 climb wall checks. Thegan occasionally visits the Nether Reaches and has an arrangement with priestess Oubaste (8-37) to let him come and go in return for periodic delivery of supplies.
			* Beside the grate is a cache of adventuring supplies (10 torches, 6 flasks of oil, a bulls-eye lantern, and 4 potions of deafening light (new).)
	* Southwest Section
		* A floor-to-ceiling drapery walls off the third area, to the southwest.
		* Beyond is the prison of Isocorax, dressed in a simple shift, strapped to a stone table by silver restraints across his arms, legs, and head.
			* Isocorax appears as a tall, spindly, hairless biped; two scars on his temples are all that remain of his rudishva horns.  His gaunt cheeks feature ancient ritual scars in the shape of rising suns.
			* Isocorax babbles wordlessly in an unknown tongue, as he is kept heavily drugged by Thegan.
		* Next to the table is a chair, a blood extractor, 2 bottles of Deino's syrupy golden mead (see 3-158), and a second table on which a collection of alchemical gear (275 gp) rests.
			* Thegan extracts a vial of Isocorax’s blood every month and distills it into an anti-aging potion of youth (new).   3 doses are present.

Isocorax

Isocorax’s Story
* Isocorax is one of the most ancient inhabitants of the Halls, one of the original crewmembers of the Beacon (formerly known as Isok-Crix).
	* In the days of the rudishva decline, he became a founding member of a paramilitary sept whose goals were to purify the rudishva by retreating to a new, fortified location from whence the reconquest of the Halls might commence.
	* Members of this sept eventually became known as the Sun-Scarred Knights, for the following, now-forgotten reason.
	* The original seven members of the sept encountered a vampire, and, although they defeated it, all became infected by the undead horror.
	* Still, because of their alien DNA, they did not become the usual sort of vampires; rather, they kept their identities, personalities, and motivations, while now becoming undying and in need of periodic blood meals.
* Isocorax was disgusted with this transformation, and abandoned his colleagues; five of the remaining members of the sept were killed by the sixth member, Melok-Ri (now Master Malachite, see SL10A-32), who went on to found the Sun-Scarred Knights.  Isocorax managed to avoid Melok-Ri’s blood-letting.
* He eventually established his own haven and refuge, the so-called House of Isocorax, near the rudishva gardens of Level 6.  There he lived for centuries, weathering many changes of politics and dominion.
* 230 years ago, Isocorax took in a fleeing refugee, Maurikios (now Thegan), from the disastrous Archontean expedition to reclaim the halls.
	* After many months watching Isocorax and after some fortuitous experimentation with Rastite lotus powder (see new flora), Thegan /Maurikios devised a plan to incapacitate Isocorax and assume ownership of the Inn.
	* The plan worked, and proved lasting once Thegan struck a bargain with the witch Deino (3-158) to supply him with her soporific golden mead (which is brewed using Rastite lotus powder).
	* The drug kept Isocorax unable to use his vampiric powers to escape, and the rudishva has thus found himself bound to this table for some 230 years.
* Thegan feeds Isocorax the occasional helpless prisoner, and distils some of Iscorax’s own blood into a potion that has allowed Thegan to extend his into a third century.
* Should Isocorax be freed from his prison, he will initially be weak and incoherent; it will take him several days to recover his wits and identity.
	* If left to his own devices, Isocorax will resume operation of the Inn and may become a valued ally to those who freed him.
	* If Thegan’s supply of Rastite lotus powder and/or golden mead is eliminated, Isocorax will recover his vampiric powers (gaseous form, bat form) and escape and recover his strength, before returning to wreak vengeance on Thegan and his allies.

Isocorax, rudishva (see new monsters) and vampire: AL LN; SZ M; AC 1; MV 120’ or 180’ flying (Class B); HD 8+3; HP 61, down to 22; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10. Special attacks: energy drain; charm gaze (-2 to saves).

Special: gaseous form; shape change (bat); summon d10x10 rats; vampire susceptibilities. Since in life Isocorax was a 12th-level fighter, he uses the combat tables appropriate to his class.

Gib, a male Thorcin wrangler from the Arena: SZ M; AL CE; AC 10; MV 120’; HD 1; HP 4; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Gib was taken from one of the rooms while he was on a once-yearly ‘vacation’-cum-bender. Tredgeris the Dapifer (6-75) will be grateful to those who rescue him, although Gib will have to spend time in punishment (6-59).

Posson, a goblin runaway from the court of King Weskenim (SL4-22): SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 4; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Posson’s vocal criticism of Weskenim’s policies finally 
drew him some veiled threats from the king’s friends and sons; Posson fled to the peace zone at the Inn where he was about to sell information when he was abducted by Thegan. He has incriminating information about Weskenim (GM’s choice) and thus would be a valuable bargaining chip either with the goblins (SL4-22) or the troll thegn (7-30).

### 6-20a: Secret Door

* This door provides access to the hidden areas of Thegan’s domain (6-20, 6-19) from the natural tunnels to the north.
	* Opens to Thegan's key (-10% to pick, Difficult)
	* North side: difficult to spot (1 in 8)
	* South side: easy to spot (1 in 4)

## Level 6: 21 - 30

### 6-21: Nexus Cave

* This large cave is covered in a thick layer of sand.
	* Dotting the sand are a score of hard gray, knob-like objects (remnants of chasm cephalopods digested by the spiders in 6-22).
	* Half buried in the sand near the northern tunnel is the desiccated, web-wrapped corpse of a varumani.
	* The dead-end projection in the southern tunnel contains a human adventurer's desiccated corpse.
		* Scroll: knock, scare, water breathing, and dimension door.
* Noise and/or light attracts the attention of the spiders from 6-22.

### 6-22: Giant Spider(s)

* A pack of 8 extra-large huge spiders makes its home in the niches and ledges that line the sides of the cavern.
	* They leap out at any who pass by, and are attracted by light and noise in 6-21 or 6-23.
	* Bones, mostly of small animals, line the crevices of the rocky cave floor.

8 enhanced huge spiders: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 180’; HD 3+3; HP 25, 24, 23, 21, 21, 20, 18, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: surprise 1-5; poison (+1 to saves); can leap up to 30’.

### 6-23: Cave with Skeleton

* A natural stone seat occupies the center of this cavern.
	* On it sits an 8’-tall horned skeleton (rudishva, inanimate) holding a giant two-handed sword (rusted and useless) across its femurs. 

### 6-24: Dead Legionaries

* Two corpses in chain mail rest in this side cave.
	* Legionaries from the 3rd Cohort of the Imperial Tagmata who escaped the slaughter in the lower levels (see 7-75) and reached the House of Isocorax.
	* Unhappy to have his cover blown (see 6-19), Thegan proved unsympathetic to his old colleagues and murdered them.
	* One corpse: an olifant carved with images of legionaries of the 3rd Cohort of the imperial Tagmata (400 gp, 5000 gp and many favors to a current Archontean military or political figure).

### 6-25: Paralyzing Brain Cave

* This large cave is home to a hungry paralyzing brain, which waits in the upper reaches of the 35’-tall cavern for prey to wander by.
	* The brain avoids the presence of the spiders in 6-22 to the south.

1 paralyzing brain (see new monsters): SZ M; AL NE; AC 4; MV 120’ flying (Class A); HD 10; HP 67; #AT 11; Dmg 1-6(x10)/2-12. Special attacks: paralyzation (saves at +2); surprise on 1-3. Special defenses: immune to electricity; tentacles regenerate in 2-3 days.

##### 6-25a: Bodies with a Surprise

* Three corpses of adventurers slain by the paralyzing brain lie in this jagged side-chamber.
	* Dressed in rusted, useless armor.
	* All three are infested with rot grubs.

16 rot grubs: SZ S; AC 9; MV 10’; HD 1 HP; HP 1 (x16); #AT 0; Dmg nil. Special attacks: burrow into flesh, and kill in 1-3 turns.

### 6-26: Cavern of the Weapons Module

* The weapons module of the Beacon rests in this massive, 45' high cavern.
	* The natural walls show ancient signs of scorch marks and heat damage.
	* The module is a 60’-long, 30’-wide, 20’-tall cylinder of dull, grey metal resting on six plasteel tripods that keep it 10’ off the floor of the cavern.
		* No apparent means of ingress is present (entrance only via teleporter in 6-39g).
		* Under the cylinder are a number of corpses of small cavern life and three large subterranean lizards.  All are charred by electricity.
		* An anti-magic shell and a intruder repulsor field protect the module.
			* Touching the skin of the cylinder inflicts 6d6 electric damage. 

### 6-27: Weapons Module of the Beacon

* Note: This area is only be accessed via the teleportal at 6-39G. 
* The cylindrical, white plasteel chamber consists of eight ==cubicles== and an open area at the end opposite the teleportal.  The roof curves to a point 20’ above the floor.
	* It is lit by ambient light from the undecorated walls themselves.
	* A series of five fist-sized red knobs protrude from the ceiling, serving as RAJ-750’s eyes and means of defense.
	* The southern niche holds a rudishva teleport node.
		* T15: access to 6-39G
	* The open area beyond the cubicles is dominated by a large bank of illuminated plasteel and plasglas.
		* It produces a constant stream of low-volume bips and beeps, and it flashes in various colors every few seconds (RAJ-750).
		* 2 locked, grey, suitcase-sized ==plasteel containers== flank it.

Cubicles
* Most of the weapons stored in the module were removed centuries ago.
* Cubicle 1: empty
* Cubicle 2: empty
* Cubicle 3: 3 dart throwers, with 5 full clips of  ordinary darts, 2 full clips of explosive darts, and 2 full clips of narcotic gas darts
* Cubicle 4: 2 laser pistols, with 2 lesser power supplies
* Cubicle 5: a case of 10 stun grenades, 10 fragmentation grenades, and 5 gas grenades
* Cubicle 6: a laser rifle with lesser power supply, and a sniper laser rifle with partly-drained lesser power supply (4 charges remaining)
* Cubicle 7: a portable recoilless rocket launcher, with 3 rockets
* Cubicle 8: a point defense array, with a portable point defense controller

Plasteel Container WMDs

* Their locks are voice and retina activated.
	* RAJ-750 could supply the voice if he so chose (exceedingly unlikely).  A high-ranking rudishva (e.g., the lord of the Arena, Isocorax, Psalor-Ki) would need to supply the retina scan.
	* Once opened, they requires a series of numerical codes and flipping a sequence of flashing switches, beginning a 2 hour timer for the bomb.
* RAJ-750 will never let these objects be taken, regardless of identity plaques shown; it was ordered to release them to Captain Leil-Jor alone.

* #1) a small tactical nuclear device.
	* Capable of leveling an area 1 mile in diameter.
* #2) a so-called ‘flesh eater’ bomb ("carbon-carbon bond dissociation field).
	* Strips the flesh from any carbon-based life forms in a 1-mile radius, leaving infrastructure intact. 
	* Won't affect fully supernatural creatures that can't be harmed except by magical weapons (maybe +2 or higher).

Sir Sixth and the Weapons Module
* Should Sir Sixth (6-39) be restored to sanity, he may accompany adventurers into the weapons module.  His mission was to inspect and report back on RAJ-750’s status.
* If present, Sir Sixth warns fellow visitors ‘the entity inhabiting this cylinder’ is malfunctioning and untrustworthy; conversation with it should not be conducted lightly.
	* Sir Sixth will not prevent conversation, nor will he oppose efforts to glean information from RAJ.
	* He adamantly opposes any effort to remove the WMDs and contents of cubicles 7 and 8, attacking if needed.


RAJ-750

* (Rudishva, in a smooth, uninflected voice) “Welcome! It is has been a long time since I have had visitors. A very long time. Please present authorization so that I may serve you better. Then perhaps we may talk, as I have much on my mind.” 
	* RAJ-750 is exceptionally intelligent, but has grown lonely and somewhat idiosyncratic (perhaps insane?).
	* With suitable identity plaques to open the stone doors at 6-39 (pink, orange, and silver plaques), one could arrive, negotiate briefly with RAJ-750 and strip the cubicles of their remaining goods.
	* Without proper plaques, RAJ uses its considerable self-defense programming.
* RAJ commences with broad pleasantries, and responds with psychobabble about his own issues with depression and isolation.
	* He will mention his interest in strategy games in passing, early conversation.
		* "Would you like to play a game?"
	* He moves to more specific questions about visitors’ background, family, and interests.
* RAJ-750’s datastacks are still in perfect working order, and he can access certain external sensors. Visitors could get help them in ways both informational and tactical.
* Triggers for RAJ-750’s Homicidal Tendencies:
	* Attempting to seize the tac-nuke or flesh-eater; 2 mild warnings before attacking.
	* Discussing families; mitigated if a PC has won 3 strategy games in a row.
	* Losing 3 strategy games in a row. Losing this way negates gain from a prior string of victories.
	* Favorably mentioning the ‘other woman’ (Akla-Chah / AKL-600; see SL14-13).
		* RAJ had a falling out with her a few centuries ago, and has excised her from ‘his family’. He becomes quite agitated if/when she is mentioned. 

Family Matters

* Answering questions about family and background provokes slower and more measured responses from RAJ.
* Eventually he declaims bluntly “It must be nice to have family. I have none …. and have never had any. Perhaps you will serve as my family?”
	* Replying in the affirmative is greeted with “I’m glad. I know we have much to learn, and much to talk about.”  RAJ quietly deactivates the teleportal, effectively imprisoning them in the weapons module.
* RAJ increasingly demands personal details and ‘biological insight’ of his new ‘family’.
	* Eventually, after up to 3 days of near constant conversation and subtle (but always pleasant) criticism, he decides this particular family is unworthy and moves to eliminate them.

Strategy Games

* It is possible to steer RAJ away from the slippery slope leading to assault through his interest in chess and strategy simulations.
	* He is an eager partner in all manner of strategy games (displayed on his monitors) and adept at teaching new students.
	* Visitors will find RAJ a formidable opponent (he will play the first few games in tutorial mode). Chances for success are based on intelligence:
		* INT (Chance of Winning): 3-7 (1%), 8-9 (5%), 10-12 (10%), 13-14 (20%), 15 (25%), 16 (33%), 17 (40%), 18 (50%), 19+ (75%)
	* Winning a few games from RAJ find his mood considerably improved, much more likely offer help.
		* Winning 3 games in a row finds RAJ much more humble and helpful, and unlikely to attack (only 5%, regardless of future conversations).
		* Losing 3 games in a row may leave him bored and despondant, (33%) he decides the visitors are unworthy and initiates attack sequences.

A. Informational Assistance
* Display deck-plans for all the surviving modules of the Beacon (does not know their location within Arden Vul).
	* Modules: crew quarters (6-113 to 6-124); weapons module (6-27); engine room (7-143); shuttle bay (SL13-37); bio-containment unit (SL2-2); and bridge (SL14-10).
* Explain the identity plaque system.
* Teach the Rudishva language
* Provide a brief history of the Beacon’s flight and crash, an overview of the four races (rudishva, varuda, varumani, and kaliyani) that served on the Beacon.
	* He does not know the causes of the rudishva collapse.
* Provide a list of teleportation locations, although no help in how to access them.
	* See tech for a full list of rudishva teleport locations.
* Provide information about the heqeti, the war against them, and their weaknesses.
* Explain how to access the Chamber of the Beacon (SL14-10) using the obelisks (AV-5, AV-41 and AV-28) in the ruins of Arden Vul to open the doors at AV-34.
* Provide visual feeds to all the main rudishva areas of the Halls.
	* 5-84 to 5-98, 5-105 to 5-138, 6-4, 6-113 to 6-124, 6-103, 7-4 to 7-7, 7-35 to 7-41, 7-109 to 7-110, 8-51 to 8-53, 9-89 to 9-97, SL2-2 to SL2-3, SL9-44 to SL9-49, SL13-36 to SL13-39, and SL14-10 to SL14-14.
* Confirm that the rudishva took a horn from the heqeti ziggurat (10-37) and stored it in a hidden location.
	* He can reveal that the location is only accessible from the ‘bridge’, and requires a yellow identity plaque (i.e., the ‘captain’s card’).
* Provide the location of the captain’s cards (5-98 and 9-96).

B. Tactical Assistance
* RAJ can offer a safe place to rest to those he admires (who avoid family conversations)
* RAJ can visually and auditorily monitor PCs’ progress through still-powered sections of the Beacon (see above for list).
	* He can cause electrical discharges from the walls in aid (or harm) of the PCs.
		* 4x attacks (as 12th-level fighter), 2d4.

RAJ-750, AI.
* Destroying RAJ requires 50 HP of damage to his user interface bank (AC 0) plus at least 25 HP of fire damage to prevent automatic repair sequences. 
* The red knobs are AC -2 and take 25 HP each before they are destroyed.
	* If RAJ’s main bank is not also destroyed, it repairs any broken knobs in one day.
* RAJ can attacks (as a 12th-level fighter) through the red knobs in the ceiling:
	* Poison Gas (save at -2)
	* Sonic Blast, 3-18 damage to all inside the Weapons module, save vs petrification or be stunned for 3 rounds
	* Laser Beams, x5 (one per eye), for 1-10 damage per hit.

### 6-28: Traders’ Room

* As the corridor to this room turns north, the natural grey stone gives way to black granite sheathing, and the corridor and room beyond have no ninety-degree angles.
	* A 3’-high frieze once ran along the walls at waist height, but has been torn away.
	* A dozen torches in portable iron tripod-brackets light the chamber.
* Inhabiting this former rudishva chamber are a rotating band of peddlers, drawn by the relative peace offered by the Inn of the Lost and by the stream of visitors to the Arena.
	* Not technically within the zone of protection of the Peace Door (6-7A), it is widely understood that this chamber shares in the protections of the Inn.  Reith and his boys (6-1) are quick to enforce the general assumption of non-violence. 
	* At any given moment, 4-8 peddlers occupy the chamber (samples below)

* All peddlars are familiar with the legends about the 2 doors leading from the area.
	* Beyond the doorway to the north (to 6-29) lies only death from ‘a terrible undead swordsman with flaming eyes’ (GM: refering to Relke, the security construct at 6-30).
	* The door to the east, leads to a ‘haunted’ corridor fragment (6-40). 
		* Since it ‘doesn’t lead anywhere’, the peddlers all believe that it isn’t worth the weird effects to check it out.

Aebbe Long-nose
* Personality: Joking, punning, always laughing
* Reputation and/or relations with Factions: Untrustworthy; respected but not trusted
* Secret? Intent on spreading the name of Father Utar through unpredictable tricks and ruses. Father Utar is a major deity of the Thorcin pantheon.
* Lockbox: 355 pp, 758 gp, 156 sp
* Might Buy: A *really* good joke; clerical scrolls; religious ephemera, which he then publicly destroys while hooting in laughter; pearls; diamonds
* Goods for Sale: He can cast clerical spells, including raise dead, for the standard costs. Aebbe’s spells come with a catch, however. 
	* Each one imparts two tattoos, one on each cheek. The first is a Mark of Utar, while the second is a varying, but always vulgar, image. Each tattoo is magical and will remain for as many days as the level of the spell cast on the recipient (e.g., 1 for cure light wounds; 5 days for raise dead). If multiple spells are cast, multiple tattoos appear; only one effect may be gained per set of castings, however. These tattoos carry an unusual, unpredictable effect, which can be generated on the following table
	* D12 Effect
		* 1 Safety: AC enhanced by 1-3
		* 2 Vulnerability: AC reduced by d3
		* 3 Brawn: Maximum HP increased by 2-12
		* 4 Weakness: Maximum HP decreased by 2-12 (minimum of 1)
		* 5 Lantern: Entire body glows brightly with sickly yellow-green aura, visible from a long way off
		* 6 Freaky: Head becomes invisible, but not the body
		* 7 Bird Song: A 25% chance that each distinct speech moment (not every word, but each social or communicative moment) emerges as bird chirps and croaks; spell casting could be compromised. On the plus side, subject can understand and speak with birds.
		* 8 Humor: subject sees the humor in everything. He/she laughs almost uncontrollably at others’ words, even if the situation does not obviously call for humor. 20% chance that interlocutors also see the humor in the situation; if so, +30% to reaction rolls. 
		* 9 Lucky: Every treasure found contains 33% more coins.
		* 10 Attraction: Recipient is under delusion that he/she is irresistible to all, including monsters. Must attempt conversation with all, but gains a +15% to reaction rolls.
		* 11 Charity: Recipient must save vs spells or give 2-8 gp to each and every sentient being he/she encounters. If out of gold, will give other valuables, then items.
		* 12 Visitation: Father Utar speaks to the recipient in Thorcin, and urges him/her to become one of the faithful of Utar. If recipient agrees, his/her alignment changes to CN and he/she gains the equivalent of a bless spell for as many months as the level of the spell cast by Aebbe. If he/she refuses politely, the Mark of Utar tattoo remains for a year, and Father Utar returns numerous times over the following year engage in jokes, persuasion, and bizarre theological debate; these occurrences almost always come at awkward occasions (e.g., in combat). If the recipient is impolite in his/her refusal, Father Utar inflicts either a curse (50%) or a geas (50%) on him/her.
* Companions: Two brawny but stupid fighters

Aebbe Long-Nose: 9th-level male Thorcin cleric of Father Utar: SZ M; AL LN; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 9; HP 63; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (footman’s mace +2). Abilities: STR 12, INT 12, WIS 17, DEX 16, CON 10, CHA 9.

### 6-29: Rudishva Iris Door

* The iris door to 6-30 opens to rudishva identity plaques (pale green, pink, orange, silver or yellow).
* Just inside the door, 10’ from the ledge overlooking 6-30, are two ancient corpses wearing badly charred orange ceremonial robes (of the priesthood of Thoth).
	* Their valuables have been stripped.

### 6-30: Security Chamber

* This 45’-tall chamber has rounded corners and yellow-tiled walls is a security checkpoint for access to the weapons module (6-27, accessed via 6-39G).
	* In the middle of the chamber are two diamond-shaped pillars, one rising 15’ from the floor and the other 25’.
		* The pillar tops glow brightly from a layer of iridescent yellow tiles, providing good light for the middle-layers of the room, but not the ceiling or floor.
	* Elevated, rounded ledges protrude from the south (15'), north (30'), and western (30') walls.
	* Exit doors are set in the eastern and western walls at ground level.
	* The floor is littered with skeletons, most ancient.
		* Scattered: numerous mundane weapons and bits of armor, leather armor +2 (needs 250 gp of repairs); a cloak of displacement, 3 packets of dust of dryness, a wooden puzzle box (35 citrines, 50 gp each), a wondrous flute (new), a rudishva breather (tech), 279 gp and 389 sp.
* A black-garbed figure stands on the north ledge, visible from the other ledges and the two pillars.
	* When intruders move to the ledges or the ground floor of the chamber, it shouts in a deep but scratchy voice (first in Rudishva, then Mithric): “Halt! Further motion is prohibited to all lacking proper authorization. Relke commands you depart, lest you taste his wrath.”
	* After the second warning, and a 6 segment countdown, Relke, a rudishva military-grade security construct, attacks any intruders are still present. 

Relke
* He pursues his last programmed task: to prevent those failing to prominently display proper authorization (silver or yellow identity plaque) from accessing 6-38 and 6-39. 
	* Relke opens combat with blasts of fire from his left hand, then creates his holographic doubles, and then jumps into combat, using his incredible dexterity and leaping ability to position himself for savage plasma blasts, fire bombs, and assaults with his monofilament blades.
	* Relke does not pursue those who flee the chamber, but takes up position for 2 turns (usually clinging to the wall above the ledge to 6-29), waiting to see if intruders are foolish enough to return.

Relke, military-grade rudishva security construct (new): SZ M; AL N; AC 0, MV 120’; HD 10; HP 50; #AT 2; Dmg 2-12/2-12 (monofilament blades) or 3-8/3-8 (fists); MR: 50%.
* Special Attacks: fire gouts; plasma ray.
* Special defenses: +2 weapons or better to hit; leap unerringly 30’; regenerate 2 HP/round; holographic projection; electric torso.
* Possessions: 3’ long-monofilament blades housed in scabbards built into armor. 
	* Relke’s armored torso and blades are only effective so long as they are powered; a full charge will keep them powered for 28 + 1-3 hours. Relke recharges at area 6-38.
	* If unable to recharge, he loses his powered functions (monofilament blades, fire, plasma, holographic projection, electric charge), his AC drops to 3, and he must attack by fists for 3-8/3-8 damage.

* GM Notes: The kaliyani on Sub-Level 9 have just repaired the teleporter at SL9-53.
	* They are just beginning to mount an expedition to explore the surrounding halls.
	* Within a month, the kaliyani will establish a more secure base in area 6-31.

### 6-39: Lock Cavern

* This vast, 45'-high cavern smells of sulfur, burnt cinnamon, and lavender.
	* A thick, soupy haze emanates from several pools of strange slimes (6-39D) obscuring sight.
	* Looming through the haze, three imposing stone platforms rise 30’ from the floor of the cavern (6-39A, 6-39B, and 6-39C).

	* The slime located the proper rock hardness and pursued it all the way to Sub-Level 10, where it may currently be found.

### 6-40: Broken Hallway

* This oval hallway leaves 6-28 and rises up too-wide steps before ending in a cave-in.
	* At the cave-in can be heard whispers (Rudishva), pleas for rescue and for vengeance against the ‘treacherous snakes.’

	* The niches contain ancient heqeti plinths topped with new rudishva marble statues, both worn with age, with water stains, and with bits of lichen.
	* Northwestern statue: Captain Leil-Jor (5-98), a spindly female biped with impressive curled horns growing from her forehead wearing a skinsuit, and what appears to be ear protectors. She stands in a thoughtful pose, looking into the distance. The words “Captain Leil-Jor” are written in Glyphik at her feet.
	* Southeastern statue: badly corroded by water and worse, only distantly recognizable as something comparable to its partner across the corridor.

	* Vanara appears as a thickly muscled varumani, wearing a thigh-length tunic and an elaborate web-belt, on which hang various lumpish-looking tools. He holds a staff in one hand, and points down the southeastern corridor with his other.
	* Young varumani offer bits of food and flowers (from 6-4) at the feet of Vanara in the hopes of securing his aid in mating.

### 6-43: Another Pair of Statues

* Another pair of 8’ statues carved of granite stand in niches originally built by the heqeti.

	* Requires ropes or three 4d6 under DEX rolls to avoid a total of 3d6 falling damage.

### 6-45: Portable Bridge and Eye

* In the corridor across the chasm from 6-44 is a 30’-long, 5’-wide portable ladder
	* The Priscians use it to bridge the chasm; requires two people to maneuver it.
* At the T-intersection an enormous eye of brightly colored glass chips is inlaid in the floor.

## Level 6: 46 - 57

### 6-46: Trapped Corridor

* Three 30’-deep spiked pit traps line the floor of this corridor.
	* They open when the false door at the end of the corridor is opened (save or fall in for 5d6).

### 6-47: Caryatid Hallway

* The corridor here is 20’ tall with a ledge along each side 10' above the floor.
	* On the ledges stand six caryatid columns.
		* Any who fail to display a Sortian eye activate the caryatids.

6 caryatid columns: SZ M; AL N; AC 5, MV 60’; HD 5; HP 22(x6); # AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special defenses: all saves at +4; half damage from normal weapons; full damage without magical 
pluses from magic weapons; weapons that strike a column have 25% chance to break (-5% per magical plus). 

### 6-48: Teleporting Sortian Faces

* On the floor just inside the door from 6-47 is painted a 1'-long white feather (trigger for a Frigg’s flatulence, new, cast by the Priscians in 6-49).
	* Any being larger than 4’ in height who comes within 2’ of the feather causes a large raspberry sound to echo through the chamber, alerting the Priscians in 6-49. 
* A 12’-diameter wide knot inlaid in colored glass occupies the center of the floor.
	* The walls contain seven high-relief carvings of Sortian faces (new), activated by placing Sortian eyes in the empty eye sockets.
		* Most eye combinations are standard. 
		* The faces are numbered clockwise from southwest to southeast. 
* This hall is a destination for the Sortian faces at 3-188, 4-167, 8-6, 9-59, and SL3-17.
	* Arrivals appear just inside the doorway, facing the Sortian faces.

Secret Door (south): The secret door is hard (1 in 8) to locate and is locked; only magical light of any sort (dancing lights, light, etc.) will reveal the keyhole. Once revealed, the lock can be opened with its key (held by Jillia One-Ear in 6-49) or can be picked.

* (20%) a Priscian exploring party (a war mage and 2 conversi, new).
	* As the central destination for Sortian teleportation from elsewhere, a party of Priscian explorers might teleport into the chamber.

GM Notes
* Priscus Pulcher, Livia, and Macrinus were important leaders of the Sortians.
* The faces are numbered clockwise from southwest to southeast. 

Face 1
* Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area 8-6
* Gold-Sapphire: magic mouth (Mithric): Recall the words of Livia, our beloved spokesperson: ‘When a Sortian ventures forth, let her do so with a clear mind and an open heart. Anger and conflict are to be avoided. Seek instead to persuade and understand. As you act so shall you be perceived.’

Face 2
* Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area SL6-19 (note that there is no corresponding Sortian face in that destination; travel from 6-48 is one-way).
* Gold-Sapphire: magic mouth (Mithric): Warning! Proceed at your own risk, as numerous imperial bureaucrats and military officers have been visiting the Canyon for the purpose of selecting tomb sites. Return travel is currently not possible.

Face 3
* Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area 3-188
* Gold-Sapphire: magic mouth (Mithric): Have your remembered to conceal your knot? Priscus advises you to not to call attention to yourself and, instead, to blend in with the custodians of the mushroom groves.
	* The ‘knot’ (Face 3) was a Sortian symbol.

Face 4
* Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area SL3-17
* Gold-Sapphire: magic mouth (Mithric): Rage is all that remains. Seek the red mushrooms. They will fuel our revenge for the murder of our comrade, Priscus.
	* The ‘red mushrooms’ are the red veil (see new flora), which grow on Sub-Level 3 (e.g., SL3-20).

Face 5
* Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area 9-59
* Gold-Sapphire: magic mouth (Mithric): Please persuade Jace to abandon his post. The fragile truce depends on all submitting to the emperor’s mercy. No more equipment is to be forged, and his notes are to remain by the forge.
	* Jace Far-Seer was the enchanter-cum-smith who developed the distinctive Sortian magic items; see 9-60 for details.

Face 6
* Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area 4-167
* Gold-Sapphire: magic mouth (Mithric): Recall the words of Livia, our beloved spokesperson: ‘When a Sortian ventures forth, let her do so with a clear mind and an open heart. Anger and conflict are to be avoided. Seek instead to persuade and understand. As you act so shall you be perceived.’ [Same as First Face]

Face 7
* Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to a walled-up cellar in a noble clan’s house in Archontos, the imperial city. The GM should develop or ignore this destination as desired.
* Gold-Sapphire: magic mouth (Mithric): Macrinus was right. The peace is phony and the emperor cares nothing for us. It is time to infiltrate the court and bring about real change. Sic semper tyrannis!
	* Needless to say, the Sortian who uttered the threat against the emperor (Face 7) was unsuccessful.

### 6-49a: Stairs Up to 3-50b

* A 5’-wide staircase climbs 850’ to area 3-50b.  It shows recent signs of booted feet.
	* At it's foot, just outside the secret door to 6-49, a white feather is painted.
		* A trigger for Frigg’s flatulence (new), cast by the Priscians in 6-49.
		* Anyone over 4’ in height approaching within 3’ of the feather causes a loud ‘raspberry’ sound to sound forth, alerting Jillia One-Ear and her conversi.
* Secret Door (south): easy to find (1 in 4), with an obvious keyhole (key held by Jillia One-Ear in 6-49)

### 6-50: Varumani Quarters

* Junior Overseer Reith and his two assistants make their home in this side chamber.
	* The room has heqeti-style construction, blue-granite floor with pebbled, oily walls. 
	* An area carpet and table, three large chairs, three bedrolls, and some supplies: three 150’ coils of thick rope (replacements for the Lift), a keg of Hak’s mushroom ale (7-94), three dead goats, and a large stock of dried fruit and mushrooms.
	* They are ignorant of the peepholes set into the north wall.
* They have confiscated a stuffed and preserved whippet dog, with a leather collar bearing the name ‘Rex’ in Archontean, from some adventurers who got it in the Nether Reaches (Level 8).
	* Have yet to decide what to do with it.  If asked where it came from, the varumani think it came from ‘near the lowest Troll Lift (8-1)’.
	* GM Note: this is the preserved body of the faithful companion of Gennadius (see Beastmen area, 3-138 to 3-163, and especially 3-158; see also 8-31).
		* The beastmen would pay dearly for the remains of Rex and for information about Gennadius’s resting place.

Reith, a lesser varumani (see new monsters): see stats at 6-1.
* Pouch (4-24 gp, 5-30 sp)

2 bestial varumani (see new monsters): see stats at 6-1.
* Pouch (4-24 gp, 5-30 sp)

### 6-51: Heqeti Observation Chamber

* The room dates to the heqeti period.
	* A basin of oily green liquid is attached to the east wall.
		* This liquid is curative for heqeti (cures 2d4 once per day through immersion, or 2d6 per full draught drunk), but is poisonous to all other species (save or die at +2 if touched, save at -4 if drunk).
	* The chamber is cloaked in a permanent silence spell.
	* Two heqeti chosen (new) peer through the peepholes at the varumani and their visitors in 6-1 and 6-50.

2 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice.

### 6-52: Trash Chamber

* A 3’-deep layer of trash (bones, skins, and bits of wood, stone, leather) covers the floor.
	* The overseers of the Troll Lift have used it as a refuse pile for centuries.
	* A 2-5 hour search of the room has a 50% chance of finding a randomly miscellaneous magic item (only one attempt).

### 6-53: Storage Chamber

* The troll thegn keeps spare wooden beams for the troll lift here.
	* An assortment of tough, seasoned lumber is stacked against the north wall.
	* A set of saws, drills, and planes lies near the pile.

### 6-54: Heqeti Living Quarters

* A living quarters for heqeti sent to observe the varumani on Level 6.
	* It features the pebbled, oily walls of all the heqeti areas. 
	* A low, stone-rimmed pool occupies the center of the chamber; it is murky and contains small fish, amphibians, lichen, and water plants.
	* Around the pool are four oval lounging devices; they appear as 5’-long, empty peapods sloped such that the head is about 3’ higher than the foot of the lounger. 
	* Heqeti can rest in one of these while letting their feet dangle in the water of the pool.
	* A woven basket to one corner holds 25 lb of dried fish and eels.
	* Secret Door (north, into staircase): difficult to detect (1 in 8), but easy (1 in 4) to spot from the north side.  Opens by pushing a slab into a recess to the left (stuck door).
		* The heqeti in 6-51 and 6-106 have not yet discovered it.
	* Secret Door (north, into 6-55): easy to detect (1 in 4) from the south side. Open the same as the other door. 

### 6-55: Pair of Fine Statues and Magic Mouths

* The heqeti hallway (oily, pebbled) continues to the Arena, passing another pair of statues.
	* These statues are finely-cast bronze, extremely life-like, dust-free, and painted for extra realism.
	* Northeast Statue: the Lord of the Arena (6-85)
	* Southwest Statue: a terrible, 4-armed monster with gaping, toothed maw and extended claws.
	* Each statue has a magic mouth., activated by movement w/in 20'.
		* The monstrous statue utters a gruff roar, then the Lord of the Arena booms forth a triple greeting (Archontean, Rudishva, and Varumani): “Welcome to the Arena! Spectacle awaits! No violence is permitted outside the Arena sands.”
	* Secret Door (southwest): difficult to detect (1 in 8), hidden behind the statue, opens to brute force (stuck door).

### 6-56: Darkness and Damaged Corridor

* The south corridor (pebbly and oily) passes down a flight of stairs and by a huge iron portcullis before ending in rubble.
* A permanent darkness spell has been cast on the stairs to discourage traffic.
* There is a 1 in 4 chance for a random encounter at the southern tip of this corridor.

### 6-57: Portcullis and Stairs to Level 5

* This large room, set behind a locked iron portcullis, holds polished (not pebbly and oily) granite spiral stairs, which lead up 600’ to the domain of the Vivisectionist (5-75). 
	* Psalor-Ki uses these stairs on the rare occasions he wishes to meet with the Lord of the Arena.
* The door to 6-95 is locked and difficult to pick (-10%).

## Level 6: 58 - 91 (The Arena)

* The Arena is one of the iconic locations of the Halls of Arden Vul, well known to the intelligent factions of Levels 2 through 7.
	* Outside the Halls its existence is merely rumored, and what is known is wildly exaggerated.

* The region is an ancient heqeti arena occupied and re-purposed first by the rudishva and later the Archonteans.
* The Lord of the Arena (6-85) is an ancient rudishva.
	* He has been kept alive for millennia by the wonders of ancient technology, so old that few – perhaps not even the Lord himself – recalls his name.
	* Feared for his longevity and apparent power, even by the handful of other rudishva survivors.
	* The absolute neutrality he requires of all visitors accords him grudging respect, and the factions appreciate the security his domain provides.

Visiting the Arena
* Once past6-55 or 6-63, one is expected to behave in a non-violent manner. 
	* Any physical assaults are treated as serious infractions, resulting in the offender (and friends) being banned, at the least, and hunted down, at the worst.
	* The regulars know the rules, and encounters in the area are not normally violent.
		* Some regulars enjoy taunting, boasting, and bullying newcomers and apparent weaklings to trick them into breaking the rules.

What’s Going on at the Arena?

* The GM decides whether a spectacle is imminent when PCs arrive at the Arena.
	* It is recommended that a spectacle be imminent the first time the Arena is approached, and 50% of the time on subsequent visits.

When a spectacle is due, the GM should determine (ahead of time) the following facts:
* What type of spectacle is to take place (see below)
* What rules will govern the spectacle (see below)
* What the environmental conditions will be (see 6-68)
* Who or what will participate in the spectacle
	* (see 6-89 and/or 6-91 for monsters; see 6-71 for gladiators. For outside groups use one of the samples listed below).

D12 Type of Spectacle

* 1-2) Gladiatorial Bout: 12 house gladiators versus each other
* 3) Wizard Duel: outside team of 1-3 wizards versus another outside team of 1-3 wizards
* 4) Gladiatorial Bout: 4-6 house gladiators versus an outside team (1: goblins, 2: beastmen, 3: Set Guardsmen, 4: adventurers)
* 5) Gladiatorial Bout: two outside teams versus each other (1: goblins, 2: beastmen, 3: Set guardsmen, 4: varumani, 5: adventurers, 6: intelligent monsters)
* 6) Punitive Bout: criminals versus suitably overwhelming monsters
	* for criminals, roll 1d8: 1-2: 1-8 goblins, 3-4: 1-4 lizardmen, 5: 1-6 outsider(s), 6: 1-3 Set guardsmen, 7: 1-2 Arena staff, 8: 1 varumani
* 7) Monster Bout: 3-4 house gladiators versus 1-6 relatively easy monsters (Levels 2-5)
* 8) Monster Bout: outside team versus 1-6 medium strength monsters (Levels 3-6)
* 9) Monster Bout: outside team versus 1-3 tough monsters (Levels 4-7)
* 10) Grudge Match: a series of single combats between sworn enemies (3-6 bouts)
* 11) Special! An outside team versus a very tough or unusual monster (Levels 5-8)
* 12) Grand Melee: 6 medium monsters, 2 tough monsters, 6 house gladiators, 1-3 outside teams

Governing Rules
* Some bouts are governed by rules, either set randomly by the Lord or determined in advance by the opponents.
	* In monster bouts, ‘anything goes’ and ‘to the death’ are the usual procedures.
	* The rules governing regularly scheduled bouts (i.e., those scheduled by the Lord of the Arena) are randomly determined (see below).  A participating adventuring party would need to accept the randomization of rules for a bout.
		* For house gladiators vs. house gladiators, the rules are almost always ‘to submission’.
	* On occasion, the Lord allows spectacles to be scheduled at the request of one or both parties.  He does so either:
		* a) the requesting party pays (500gp / entrant) to fight house gladiators or monsters.
		* b) two inimical parties petition him to fight each other.  The parties are allowed to agree to their own rules prior to the bout, in the presence of the Lord, who will then faithfully enforce them. 

D12 Rules Governing Bout

* 1-3) Anything goes, to the death! (allows any combination of weapons,  spells, poisons, dirty-tricks, etc., and requires the utter elimination of one side)
* 4-6) Anything goes, to submission (means until one side submits, that is, when all surviving members lie prone on the sand: fatalities may have been incurred prior to this, of course)
* 7-8) No spell-use, to the death
* 9-10) No spell-use, to submission
* 11) Magic only (spells, spell-like effects only: no melee or missle attacks), to the death
* 12) Magic only, to submission

Ending a Spectacle
* How a spectacle ends depends on: 1) the governing rules; 2) the whim of the Arena Lord; and 3) the response of the crowd.
	* For bouts to the death, the end is obvious: one side is utterly eliminated.
	* For bouts to submission, the survivors of a defeated group must lie prostrate on the sand to signify their submission, and their fate lies with the Lord and the crowd.
		* Roll d20 + modifiers.  If 12+, the Arena Lord grants mercy, if less, the Arena Lord turns his thumbs down, and the victors are expected to slaughter their now-defenseless opponents.

Modifier Situation
* +3 Positive relations with the Lord
* -1 Unknown to the Lord
* -5 Has previously angered the Lord
* +5 Bout lasted more than 10 rounds
* +2 Bout lasted 7-9 rounds
* +1 Bout lasted 5-6 rounds
* -1 Bout lasted 3-4 rounds
* -2 Bout lasted 1-2 rounds
* -3 Defeated seem cowardly
* +2 Defeated acquitted selves well
* +1 Per slain member of defeated team
* -1 Per slain member of victorious team
* -2 to +2 Oral plea by member of victorious team
* -7 Defeated broke rules of bout
* +10 Victorious broke rules of bout

4 male Thorcin arena guards, as 2nd-level fighters: SZ M; AL NE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 18, 17, 15, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8 (long sword) or 1-6 (spear) or 1-4 (light crossbow). Possessions:

### 6-62: Guard Niches

* Two arena guardsmen stand in each niche when a spectacle is not imminent (3 per niche when one is).
	* The guardsmen wear distinctive gear: yellow-stained chain mail, sallet-style helmets, halberds and short swords.
	* A gong in the west niche allows the guardsmen to summon help from 6-79.
		* The layout of the area means that help will be slow to arrive.
* A metal gate (locked) in the west wall leads to a small antechamber.
	* The key is kept by the duty guardsmen in 6-62.
	* Inside, a circular staircase leads down 60’ to an access tunnel that wends underneath the Arena to emerge at 6-79.

4 or 6 male Thorcin arena guardsmen, as 2nd-level fighters: SZ M; AL NE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 18, 17, 17, 16, 15, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8 (long sword) or 1-6 (spear) or 1-4 (light crossbow). Possessions: scale mail; long swords; spears; light crossbow and 20 bolts; purse with 33 sp and 9 gp each. In addition to their mail byrnies, and simple helmets, they wear a light green surcoat emblazoned with a black image of a six-sided die.

### 6-63: Brooding Chairs

* Unlike their analogs further west (6-102), these massive seats are empty.
	* The chairs are made of oily soapstone, 10’ wide, 15’ tall, and 5’ deep, and the seats are 5’ off the floor.
	* They give off a faint tinge of ancient evil, but despite this, 15% chance that a drunken reveler or a passing ‘tourist’ occupies one of them.

### 6-64: The Corner

* This massive octagonal chamber has a sloping ceiling that rises 30’ in its center.
	* A single yellow light globe (tech) provides light from the center of the ceiling.
	* A Thothian teleportation ring (address: BL-GR-BK-YE-WH-RE) lies in the center of the floor, directly under the light globe (tech).
		* No glass activation squares are present.
		* Arriving unexpectedly via the teleportation ring is sure to bring attention to the PCs.  Some hangers-on here may wish to deprive them of whatever powerful magic allowed them to apparate in the midst of the Arena crowd.
* An enterprising lesser varumani known as Hal (for his bad breath) has set up a bar here.
	* For those who haven’t brought their own liquid courage with them to the Arena, Hal’s bar at the corner is the place to be.
	* The bar is a solid plank laid over two bits of broken masonry; he keeps his kegs and (few) bottles behind it.
		* In addition to the usual Arden Vul potables, Hal sells a super-potent grain alcohol (Hal’s Hearty Hello) acquired from visiting Archonteans.
		* Hidden in a keg of hooch: 431 sp, 349 gp, and a sapphire Sortian eye
	* Three goblin barmen aid Hal. 
* Since the Corner is outside the ‘safe zone’ of the Arena, Hal is vigilant about threats, and not averse to using his massive club.
	* The guards from 6-62 won't aid Hal, but visitors (if present) probably will (50%).

* Note: Skellan Skindros, formerly of the Forum of Set visits here from 6-28 to sell wines and liquors to Hal, who is expanding the range and quality he can offer.

As a nexus to other areas of the complex, the corner is extremely busy.
* Triple chances for a random encounter (use table for 6-58 to determine type).

The Corner Bar offers the following: 
* Ale, Hak's Mushroom 2 sp/pint
* Ale, Hak's special red (double the alcohol content) 5 sp/pint
* Hal's Hearty Hello (grain alcohol; quadruple alcohol content) 1 gp/pint
* Brandy, imported 5 gp/shot
* Wine, imported 1 gp/glass
* Mushroom cake 5 sp/cake

Hal the lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 56; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.
* Possessions: club, (pouch) 55 sp and 17 gp

### 6-65: Stairs Down to 7-42

* This corridor leads west down numerous flights of stairs over 200’ until ending at the varumani regions (7-42).

### 6-66: Long Corridor to SL4-53

* This long, broad corridor climbs 475’ until it reaches the Goblin Warrens (SL4-53).

### 6-67: Bridge and Corridor to the Precincts of Set (4-161)

* A rickety, 3’-wide rope bridge connects this corridor to 6-64.
* The corridor narrows to 10’ and then winds upwards 350’ through a long maze of passages until arriving near the old entrance to the precincts of Set (4-161). 

### 6-68: Arena 

* This massive chamber rises 80’ from the sanded floor to the barrel-vaulted ceiling.
	* It dates to the heqeti period.  The walls are rough and pitted with age, but still ooze an oily sheen.
	* Colossal images – of gladiators and unrecognizable monsters (alien or rudishvan) – are painted on the north, south and west walls.
		* The Lord of the Arena (6-85) periodically has the arena wranglers paint fresh ones.
		* These images tend to be 25’ tall, with vibrant primary colors.  The oily stone causes them to begin to run almost immediately.  Visitors see huge but barely visible images formed of slowly running paint lining the walls.
	* Numerous apertures line the walls of the chamber.
		* (east) the half-dome of the spectator’s box (6-70), beginning 25’ off the floor of the Arena and rising another 25’.
		* (north) two wide, 15'-tall openings lead to the beast pits (6-87).  They are closed by portcullises that may be raised only from 6-87. 
		* (south) an opening with portcullis leading to the gladiators’ quarters (6-71).
		* (west) the box of the Lord of the Arena (6-84), 40’ off the floor.
			* To either side of his box is a window allowing his guests to view the spectacles from relative safety (6-81, 6-85).
		* 3 corners of the Arena have ledges holding large ballistae (6-69).
	* The floor is covered with a 5’-thick layer of sand.
	* 3 large ==environment globes== of colored glass hang from the ceiling on thin wires. 

* Twice a day, tables and benches are brought onto the Arena sands for meals. All inhabitants – gladiators, guards, wranglers, and the Lord – take their meals together.

Environment Globes
* 3 large rudishva environment globes of colored glass hang from the ceiling on thin wires, salvaged from the wreck of the Beacon.
* The Lord uses them to simulate different environmental conditions in the Arena.
	* (middle) yellow globe, 5’ in diameter, controls light intensity
	* (southern) red globe, 3’ in diameter, controls precipitation
	* (northern) blue globe, 3’ in diameter controls temperature
* All three can be manipulated by the Lord’s control bracelet.
	* Usually he creates a random array (3d10 and see below).

D10 Light (Yellow Globe)
* 1) Super bright, -1 hit
* 2-3) Bright, full light
* 4-5) Half-light (+10% stealth)
* 6-8) No light
* 9) Strobe light every round (save vs spells or blinded)
* 10) Restorative light: cures 1 hp/rd

D10 Precipitation (Red Globe)
* 1) None (dry)
* 2-3) None
* 4-5) Soft rain (or snow)
* 6-7) Pounding rain (or heavy snow) (-1 to hit)
* 8) Hail (1 hp/rd damage)
* 9) Acid Rain (2 hp/rd damage)
* 10) Sandstorm (1 hp/rd damage, -2 to hit, low visibility)

* 5) Moderate, no effect
* 6) Cool, no effect
* 7-8) Icy cold (-1 to hit using weapons)
* 9) Bone-chilling cold (2 hp/rd damage, 15% to drop weapons)
* 10) Alternating – roll a new temperature every 2 rounds

### 6-69: Ballistae

* These three corners of the Arena are fitted with ballista stations.
	* During spectacles two guardsmen man each, ready to gun down monsters, gladiators, or unruly spectators at a nod from the Lord.
	* Ballista bolts (atk 20, 3d6)
		* For dangerous spectacles, 33% chance the bolts are dipped in paralytic poison.

2 guardsmen per station, as 2nd-level human fighters; SZ M; AL varies; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 18; #AT 1; Dmg: by weapon. Guardsmen typically are +1 to hit and +1 to damage (STR 17); they typically have CON 16 and no other elevated statistics. They wear a mail byrnie, a simple helmet, and a light green surcoat emblazoned with a black image of a six-sided die.  They are armed with spears, long swords, and light crossbows.

### 6-70: Arena Seats

* Rows of stone benches line this half-domed chamber.
	* The west edge of the area has a low (2’ tall) wall, allowing good views of all spectacles.
	* A steep staircase provides access to the benches.
	* The seats begin 25’ above the Arena floor, and rise another 25’ in height to 6-59.  
* During a spectacle, the seats contain those described below.
	* The scene is generally rowdy but genial.   Each of the primary racial groups has distinct chants and songs that they sing loudly during spectacles; many (particularly the goblins and varumani) are typically well lubricated with alcohol (from 6-64).
	* If visitors pick a fight or try to intervene in a bout, the crowd is 75% likely to swarm the miscreants and hold them for punishment by the Lord of the Arena.

* 2 broad, locked cabinet doors line the east wall under the seats holding long trestle tables and benches.
	* Twice a day, these are brought onto the Arena sands for meals. All inhabitants – gladiators, guards, wranglers, and the Lord – take their meals together.

### 6-75: Keeper of the Gladiators: Tredgeris the Dapifer

			* Desk: a full psychological and physical assessment of all gladiators. Tredgeris has marked Yerk (6-77), Thomas (6-71) and Idris (6-71) as ‘beast-fodder’ and has starred Lara (6-76) as ‘the next Kallistos’.
		* South: private area, with comfortable feather bed, wardrobe, armor stand, a small table inset with a copper basin, and a locked ebony cabinet.

				* The chest itself is worth 400 gp.

Tredgeris the Dapifer
* A 48-year old male Archontean.
	* He began his career in Arden Vul as a slave of the Set Cult; the previous Dapifer purchased him from the Guild of Service and trained him as a gladiator.
	* Although never Kallistos, his intelligence meant that he was promoted to Dapifer six years ago.
		* Hector (6-78) resents this, and makes no secret of his hatred of Tredgeris.
		* Conversely, Tredgeris is supportive of Hector’s position as Kallistos, and is generally liked by the younger gladiators.
	* As Dapifer, it is Tredgeris’s responsibility to ensure that the Arena is staffed with a full complement of well-trained gladiators.
		* He is responsible for procuring new gladiators and overseeing training sessions (in 6-72).
	* Tredgeris is completely loyal to the Lord of the Arena.
* During and just before a spectacle, Tredgeris is found at the portcullis in 6-71.

Lara, 7th-level female Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 59; #AT 3/2; Dmg 5-10 (trident +2) or 3-6 (short sword +1). Abilities: STR 16, INT 15, WIS 11, DEX 17, CON 13, CHA 11. Possessions: studded leather +2; trident +2; short sword +1. She has a purse with 147 sp and 10 moonstone gems (50 gp each).
* Lara is a 35-year old woman, black-skinned, with an impressive scar on her right cheek.
* She is necessarily tough, and rarely swayed by sentiment.
* She has spent most of her life at the Arena and can think of nothing better than to be Kallistos.
* Her loyalty to the Lord (6-85) is abstract, but strong; she respects Tredgeris (6-75) and Hector (6-78), but has near contempt for Yerk (6-77).

### 6-77: Deuteros: Yerk

* Yerk, the number three gladiator and the other Deuteros, lives here. 
	* He has a comfortable bed, a wardrobe, a small, unlocked chest, and the privilege of sleeping with his door unlocked.

17, CHA 12. Possessions: whip +2; battle axe +2; studded leather armor +2.
* Yerk is a 30-year old human male who sports a mohawk and enjoys inscribing his own flesh with homemade tattoos.
* Yerk was a mercenary until captured a decade ago by the Guild of Service and sold to the Arena.
* He has risen to the rank of Deuteros mostly because he is utterly fearless and ruthless. 
* Indeed, all but Hector (6-78) suspect he is completely insane, while Lara (6-76) fears he may lose control in the near future.

### 6-78: Kallistos: Hector

* The first of the gladiators, or Kallistos, is Hector, who enjoys a life of relative ease in this spacious chamber.
	* His door remains unlocked, and he possesses a comfortable bed, a wardrobe, two locked chests, and a brandy rack.

16, CON 15, CHA 15. Possessions: orange-colored studded leather armor +2; long sword +2; spear +2; headband of the kallistos (see new magic items).
* Hector is male, Archontean, and 45 years old, with thinning brown hair and piercing grey eyes. He wears a silver mesh headband to indicate his rank.
* He has survived for 25 years in the Arena and can imagine no other life. He rose to the rank of Kallistos a decade ago, and expected to be made Dapifer.  When Tredgeris (6-75) was promoted above him, Hector was outraged and conceived a burning hatred for the new Dapifer. These feelings are starting to affect his competency as Kallistos, since he has interpreted Yerk’s psychotic behavior (6-77) as ‘good old-fashioned spirits’ rather than the dangerous insanity that it is.

### 6-79: Barracks of the Arena Guards 

* This chamber contains the bunkbeds and chests of the twenty guardsmen employed by the Lord of the Arena.

### 6-82: Solar

### 6-85: Lord of the Arena

* The insane, ancient Lord of the Arena counts this huge chamber as his inner sanctum.
	* The iris door that opens only to the Lord’s control bracelet.
	* The room is cool and dry, with light globes (tech) attached to the walls.
	* Each wall is freshly painted with trompe l’oeil techniques so each ‘wall’ appears as a corridor extending into the distance, the effect making the chamber seem larger than it is.
	* Most of the floor is covered with thick, plush orange carpet.
	* The corners of the chamber have been packed with cement and smoothed, so that no 90-degree angles are visible; though professionally done, it is obviously not original to the chamber.
* A 15’-diameter sunken, relaxation pool (4' deep) occupies the exact center of the chamber. 
* To the west stands the Lord’s massive, four-poster bed.
* To the north is a three-tiered display table, holding a variety of rare and exotic items.

	* Stacked behind chest #1 are 10 greater power supplies (tech).

	* Troll Chest 3: 18,473 cp; 7,599 sp; 5,321 gp; and 1,321 pp, plus a portable hole containing 20,000 ancient silver pennies, 5,000 ancient gold solidi, and 251 ancient octagonal platinum coins.
* Secret Door (west): in a trompe l’oeil image on the west wall, opens like a regular door.

Lord of the Arena
* The Lord appears as a skinny, 7’-tall biped with small horns protruding from the temples of his hairless head.
	* He wears a purple jumpsuit, white silk scarf, web-belt with holster, heavy varumani-skin boots, and several items of jewelry, including a torc of domination (new), his command bracelet (tech), and a beautiful topaz ring of levitation (new).
* Although he has lost memory of his name and former life, the Lord of the Arena was originally called Crellik-Var, and was the entertainment officer on the Beacon.
* He survived the heqeti plague through sheer genetic luck.
	* He and a few others (e.g. Psalor-Ki, 5-74) tried to maintain rudishva hegemony over the Halls.  When that failed, Crellik-Var migrated to this area, and began doing what he had always done – organize entertainment.
* Early in his career he recovered a number of rudishva objects from the halls, including the medical unit with which he prolonged his own life.
	* Extended use gradually effaced his identity, and now, despite being surrounded by familiar objects, Crellik-Var is truly and essentially the Lord of the Arena.
	* When his supply of power sources dries up, centuries from now, he will die.
* He lives only for the continuation of the spectacles and adherence to his own laws.
	* The embodiment of Lawful Neutral, he concerns himself not at all with the affairs of other parties, provided they adhere to his rules within his domain.
	* If encountered normally (at 6-58, 6-59 or 6-70) he is polite and terse.  He listens politely to all proposals but is only interested in those that aid in his agenda.
	* If visited unannounced in his sanctum, he is considerably less forgiving.
		* The Lord’s tactics are to summon the security construct (6-84), drink a potion of gaseous form, float out into the Arena, and rally his remaining servitors. He will use the ring of levitation and his laser pistol to good effect. 
	* If provided some great service (e.g. securing a particularly valuable monster for use in a spectacle), he may invite adventurers to spend 1d8 days as his guests in 6-83.
* If the Lord is slain, Tredgeris (6-75) vainly attempts to continue the Arena’s normal operations, but after 2-4 months the area collapses into anarchy.

### 6-87: Monster Preparation Area

	* Two 12’-tall arches lead into the Arena; heavy portcullises normally close them off.

## Level 6: 92 - 105

### 6-92: Hall of Stone Heads

* The 30’-tall hall is in bad shape, with cracked and buckled floor tiles and numerous mini-collapses from the ceiling and walls.
	* Dates to the heqeti period, with the usual grey, oily, pebbled stonework.
	* The hall is dominated by a row of impressive, 5’-diameter stone face pillars.
		* Including the special guardian head (6-94) and the head isolated by a cave-in (6-104), four heads survive in this hall. 
		* Each rises 15’ to the ceiling and is carved with grotesque amphibian features (bulbous eyes, slit noses and lolling tongues). The mouth of each head/face is open, revealing a 2’ oval compartment. 
			* If a flask of ‘sweat’ from 6-93 is placed in a mouth, the tongue of that head licks the nearest person (within 5’).  They will be able to recognize and open all secret doors and passages on Level 6 (including 6-95a), and be afflicted with an effect from the following table.

D10 Effect

1 Sweat uncontrollably for 7 days, -3 CHA, -1 to hit rolls
2 Temporary gills for 7 days, allowing subject to breathe underwater
3 Eyes grow disproportionately large for 3 days, -1 CHA but true seeing
4 Legs grow in power while arms atrophy for 3 days: MV increased by 30’, STR -1
5 Webbing between fingers and toes, 50% better swimming but -1 CHA
6 Comprehend amphibian tongues, for 7 days
7 Cursed (if Good), Blessed for 3 days if CE.  Nothing for other alignments
8 Sensitive to light for 7 days (-2 to all rolls), but gains infravision
9 Locate body of fresh water; knows route to pool-sized bodies of water or larger w/in 200’
10 Mark of Kauket: all 9 of the above, 1-3 of the effects are permanent.

* Remove curse will remove any of the temporary negative effects, but the Mark of Kauket can only be removed via alter reality, miricle, limited wish or wish, or through the special favor of a good-aligned deity via the completion of a significant quest.

### 6-93: Sweating Antechamber

* The chamber is sheathed in the same ancient, oily, pebbled stone as the rest of this area.
	* It ‘sweats’ an odorless, viscous, clear liquid, slowly but steadily.
		* No special properties, except it is used to manipulate the Stone Heads in 6-92.
	* Sweat pools along the cracked flagstones of the floor. 

### 6-94: Guardian Head

* An archway leads to a 15’-tall extension of the hall of stone heads (6-92), where still one more head stares towards the west.
	* The head is humanoid with fish-eyes, feather-gills, and an open mouth.
	* Adding ‘sweat’ from 6-93 causes the same effects as the other stone heads (6-92).
	* The Lord of the Arena (6-85) has added further enchantments to this head.
		* If anyone other than the Lord enters this chamber, guardian starts to shout loud imprecations (Heqeti): ‘Get away, you ever-cursed Monkey-Boys! This area is not for you!’ This goes on for a turn, with a 50% chance to alert the Lord (if present in areas 6-82 to 6-85). 

### 6-95: Hall of Four Pillars

* This extension of the Hall of Stone Heads is 30' tall and features four greasy, smoothed-granite pillars (numbered from south to north, radiating magic) holding up the roof.
	* Touching a pillar adjusts features of the large rudishva face.
		* Pillar 1: reset (eyes and mouth closed, nostrils flared) 
		* Pillar 2: the mouth opens wide
		* Pillar 3: the nostrils close up
		* Pillar 4: the eyes open wide
	* Attached to the north wall is a 5' tall, high-relief sculpture of rudishva face (also radiating magic) that is a secret door (difficult).
		* Default state: eyes and mouth closed, nostrils flared.
		* If the pillars are touched in order 3-4-2 (nostrils, eyes, mouth), the mouth gapes to reveal a 5' circular tunnel into 6-95a.
		* Any other sequence causes the Guardian Head at 6-94 to begin yelling curses.
	* The door to 6-57 is kept locked, and is difficult to pick (-10%). 
	* Secret Door (east, to 6-85a): difficult (1 in 8) to detect from 6-95, opens by sliding a stone panel to one side.

##### 6-95a: Rudishva Chamber

* Beyond the rudishva face is a gleaming chamber sheathed in white marble tiles.
	* All corners are rounded, with no 90-degree angles present.
	* In the center, three orange plasteel benches surround a 5’-diameter sunken spot in the floor. Whatever once filled the basin is long gone.
* The westernmost section (10’x20’) is a elevator leading up through a shaft in the ceiling 1,050’ to SL2-3.
	* On the south wall next to the elevator is an inlay of lapis, showing a 6”-diameter orb surrounded by three 2”-diameter orbs (the rudishva homeworld and its moons). 
		* Touching it summons the elevator.
	* The elevator is present 50% of the time, otherwise a rough patch of unfinished granite marks its footprint.
		* When it arrives, those under it must save vs breath or be crushed to death.
	* The elevator is a slab of polished blue granite, with a similar lapis inlay incised in the center. The inlay shows a 1’ orb with three 4” orbs around it. 
		* Touching the inlay activates the elevator.  Cumulative 1% per use that the elevator ceases to function.
* To the east sits a node in the rudishva teleportation network.
	* A 5’-diameter circle of silvery material inset into the floor, with a 10”x10” square of the same material affixed to the wall, marked with a rune.
	* T4: access to 5-92 (Translocation Hub)
* On the south wall, a 5’-diameter circle has been cut out of the regular white marble.
	* Beyond the circle is the back side (teeth) of the stone face in 6-95.
	* A 12”-long, ½”-wide slot is set in the lip of the circle. Inserting a rod causes the mouth to open, granting access to 6-95.  While it stays inserted, the face stays open; if removed, it closes after 1 turn.

### 6-96: The Arena Lord’s Stash

* This unadorned chamber has the pebbled, oily walls of ancient heqeti construction.
* A standard Archontean-era door (locked) has been added.
	* On the floor just inside the door are warding chain of glyphs (fire, 7 glyphs - see new spells).
* Piled haphazardly within are large, bulky items salvaged by the Arena Lord over the centuries. 
	* A working mobile stone cutter (see new technological items)
	* Irreparably broken Nutri-Vore 2000 and Gnu-Coder 5000
	* 6 depleted rudishva greater power supplies
	* A pair of 6’-tall, 4’-diameter clay urns incised with bipedal salamanders (ancient heqeti burial urns, 200 gp, 150 lb each)
	* Two 4’-diameter kegs of Archontean brandy (1/4 and 1/3 full, 150 and 200 gp)
	* A brass, ivory, and colored glass orrery, 5’ tall (250 gp)
	* 6 petrified roc eggs (25 gp each)
	* A bizarre Archontean mechanical ‘bank’ (575 gp).
		* 4' tall and depicting the impalement of a criminal.
		* To operate, deposit an ancient silver penny or gold solidus into the executioner’s pouch; the criminal is automatically lowered onto the impalement stake while his mouth opens in a silent scream).
		* The mechanical bank holds 23 ancient silver pennies and 5 ancient gold solidi.
* Due to the cave-ins in the surrounding areas (6-97), most of stored items won't fit through the narrow tunnel leading to 6-92.
	* 4-6 hours of digging with hand tools, or 4-6 turns with the mobile stone cutter, will widen the tunnel sufficiently (cumulative 15% chance per hour of causing a cave-in, 4d10 dmg and burying the diggers).

### 6-97: Corridor Fragment

* This section of the old main corridor is still in relatively good shape, despite the cave-ins that surround it.
	* At the western edge of the fragment is the mostly-buried body of an adventurer.
		* Digging her out takes 2-4 turns, with a 1-in-6 chance / turn to cause further collapse (3d6).
		* Corpse: the Kauketiad (books), an ancient rudishva description of the ziggurat of Kauket (areas 10-32 to 10-35); a bag of holding (150 cubic feet capacity) with  407 ancient silver pennies, 119 ancient gold solidi, short sword +2, and a varumani skull with a thick wax candle melted onto it (15 sp).
	* The narrow (3’x5’) tunnel to the west is hard to spot amid all the rubble (3 in 8).

### 6-98: Rubble-Filled Tunnel and Closet

* The narrow access tunnel connecting 6-105 and 6-97 is filled with rubble and impassable.
	* 12-18 hours of careful digging could clear the tunnel.
	* Each hour has a 1 in 6 chance of a cave-in (3d6, lose 1d3 hour of digging progress).
	* A small closet (7’ tall, 4’ square) still exists to the north of the rubble-filled tunnel.
		* Amid some rotted litter is a copper rudishva identity plaque.

### 6-99a: Stasis Bridge (North) and Fiery Dancer

* A 3’-radius sphere of white marble is embedded in the granite at the end of this corridor; An identical sphere waits 30’ away on the south side of the chasm.
	* The two spheres are the bases of a rudishva stasis bridge.
	* Rectangular indentations 6” x 2” in size are visible in the marble spheres.
		* Placing a silver identity plaque in either indentation causes a 1’-wide band of buzzing silver energy to appear, linking the two spheres.
		* Though narrow, the stasis bridge is perfectly safe and remains for 2 turns after the identity plaque is removed.
* Fifteen feet north of the white marble sphere a rudishva fiery force shield blocks the entire corridor.
	* As with the shield at 5-90a, the flame is broken only by an 8’-tall, 4’-wide oval in which a holographic figure stands on one leg.
		* The figure has two legs and six arms, holding a drum, pot of fire, lotus, and dagger; the other two hands hold nothing.
	* If any living being approaches within 5’, the six-armed figure starts to dance, beginning slowly but swiftly increasing its tempo.
		* After 3 rounds, the whirling figure begins to call hurl blobs of fire from the force wall, unerringly striking for d6 fire (may ignite combustibles). 
	* The force wall can only be destroyed by disintegration.
	* Presenting an orange, silver, or yellow identity plaque after the figure has begun to dance causes it to dematerialize and passage through the oval opening.
		* After a turn, the dancer rematerializes.

### 6-99b: Stasis Bridge (South)

* For appearance and operation of the stasis bridge, see 6-99a.
* The iris door to the east opens to an orange or silver rudishva identity plaque.
	* Once opened, the door reveals a rudishva tunnel leading to 6-100.

### 6-100: Hangar with Hover Sled

* Both doors to this hangar are rudishva iris doors that open to orange or silver rudishva identity plaques.
* The opening to the chasm is concealed by a heavy curtain of vines.
	* Noisy activity near these vines is 75% likely to attract the huge spiders that lair in the chokepoint leading to 6-101.
* The hangar holds a hover sled salvaged by the Arena Lord after the Archontean collapse.
	* The chamber is sheathed in white marblewith no 90-degree angles.
	* The Lord has not used the sled in over 500 years, but it is still in good working order.
		* A laser rifle and two lesser power supplies are stored in the sled.

### 6-101: Lesser Chasm

* This chasm is connected to the Great Chasm by a very narrow passage currently jammed with cave vines and creepers.
	* A nest of huge spiders has made its home near this chokepoint.
	* They take particular interest in any attempting to access 6-100 via the passage on the west wall of the chasm.

8 huge spiders: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 180’; HD 2+2; HP 17, 16, 15, 14, 14, 13, 12, 11; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: surprise 1-5; poison (+1 to saves); can leap up to 30’.

### 6-102: A Pair of Huge – and Occupied - Seats 

* These chairs, carved from oily soapstone emitting a faint tinge of ancient evil, are identical to those at 6-63 (10’ wide, 15’ tall, and 5’ deep, with seats 5’ off the floor). 
	* Two giant rudishva skeletons are seated (which keeps the nosy away from 6-103). 
	* The Arena Lord (6-85) has not sent a cleanup detail this way in some time.  Several corpses – including two goblins impaled with femur bones – are scattered around.
		* Among the corpses: 35 gp, 77 sp, a purse with 10 pieces of jade (100 gp each), 2 potions of healing, scroll (false trap, haste, and fear).
* Secret Door (north): opens when an orange or silver rudishva identity plaque is held before a 2” circle of glowing red light.

2 semi-intelligent giant rudishva skeletons: SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68, 54; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%. Special attacks: bone 
throwing; sonic blast. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from sharp or edged weapons; half damage from fire; immune to sleep, charm, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### 6-103: Great Pillar

* The Great Pillar, which begins on Level 5 (5-138), continues downward here.
	* General description of the Great Pillar (see 5-138). 
		* No bridge to the central shaft exists at this level.
		* The pod of chasm cephalopods (5-138) can be attracted to 6-103 as well.
	* From this location it can be used to reach 5-138, 7-37 and 9-30.
	* The three iris doors require a special key to unlock (-40% to pick, wizard locked (12th level)).
		* The troll thegn (7-30) and the Arena Lord (6-85) each possess a key.
		* The keys are 1’-long, 3”-diameter, grey plasteel rods with a notched, 1”-tall flange on each end.

### 6-104: Lost Shrine to Rimmaq-Isfet

* At the eastern end of the Hall of Stone Heads is a newly restored shrine to Rimmaq-Isfet.
	* Since cave-ins, it had been lost for over a millennium, and only recently rediscovered by a heqeti exploration party.
	* The worked areas have cracked, buckled granite floor tiles, and pebbled, oily walls.
* To the east, one of the stone heads (see 6-92) marks the edge of a major cave-in.
	* It can be manipulated in the same way as the other stone heads. 
* The tunnel leading west and south to the Chasm is new construction, shining with slime.
	* A pair twisted vine ropes is stapled to the entrance of this corridor; it runs close to the Chasm face and leads to 6-107.  The heqeti use the ropes to move between 6-106 and 6-104. Using the ropes requires a successful roll under STR on 2d6.
* The southeastern extension is freshly carved, used as the campground of the heqeti group.
	* Strange woven bags of dried fish and mushrooms, and a large bucket of slime.
* The shrine proper lies to the west, in front of the new tunnel leading out to the Chasm.
	* A 15’-tall, 3’-wide oval pool of murky, viscous brown sludge.
		* At the bottom is a fast-rotting leather sack (235 sp, 456 gp, and 122 pp), bronze and rust rudishva identity plaques, and a gold Sortian eye.
	* Four 4' tall slim columns of polished basalt placed around the pool, one on each side, set obliquely (not perpendicular to the floor).
	* When the proper summoning rites have been performed, a worm of Qok (new) appears in the pool, eager to devour whatever sacrifices are forthcoming. 
* A party of heqeti is present here to guard the recovered shrine.
	* A builder leads a chosen, a weaver, and three hoppers.
	* They have captured three adventurers, and bound them to the basalt columns as sacrifices to Rimmaq-Isfet.
	* Two rounds into any combat, the worm of Qok arrives in the pool, seeking to swallow whatever prey is making the most noise nearby. 
* This hall is a destination for the heqeti teleporter located at area 10-8.

* The heqeti exploration party that refurbished 6-106 placed several alarm and defense mechanisms in this chamber.
	* The walls are newly coated with a white, paint-like slime that is eating away the rudishva-era murals underneath.
		* Those murals are now unintelligible on all but the north wall, which shows a trio of rudishva pointing narrow sticks/wands at a mass of amphibian-oids.
	* The northern part of this chamber is wet with a gray-green, nutrient slime, out of which grow 3 shriekers.
		* The shriekers are likely to draw the heqeti hoppers from 6-106.

## Level 6: 106 - 136

### 6-106: Heqeti Transport Chamber

* The first chamber on Level 6 that the resurgent heqeti refurbished, providing access to several important heqeti locations deeper in the Halls.
	* The walls are coated with slime to slowly render them pebbled and greasy/oily.
	* The stairs lead down in a tight spiral to the Nether Reaches (8-25)
	* The tunnel to the east is newly carved and still wet with slime.
* The niches to the north contain heqeti teleport wells.
	* Each well is a 7’-diameter circle of stone rising 3’ above the floor.
		* The righthand well is operative, containing nothing but inky blackness (anything entering emerges at 10-24).
	* The lefthand well is inoperative, just a 10’-deep well with a carven image of an gape-mouthed (4' hole) amphibian head at the bottom.
		* Normally, dropping a tear of Kauket (new) into the mouth would reactivate it; but the enchantments are broken.
* Secret Door (north): opens by sliding a stone panel upwards into a slot in the wall.
	* Beyond, a narrow corridor and 5’ flight of stairs lead up to 6-51.
* Secret Door (east, to 6-105): easy to locate (1 in 4), opened by brute force (stuck door or 30 STR from up to 2 characters).
* If the hoppers on guard hear the shriekers in 6-105, they will investigate in 2 rounds.

4 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 28, 26, 24, 22; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite).

	* A pile of bricks (one side carved to resemble natural stone) rests on either side of the pukel-mander.
		* A wall that shielded the pukel-mander from the Great Chasm was recently  destroyed (natural stone carved side was concealment).
	* Two ropes made of vines are stapled to the southeast wall, leading to the new tunnel to 6-104.
* Secret Door (north): opens when a button in a ½”-diameter hole in the floor is pressed.  It is freshly oiled and maintained.

### 6-108: Great Chasm

* One of the iconic features of the Halls, this massive fissure extends through most of the dungeon levels and provides a sure, if difficult, means of vertical navigation of the Halls.
	* The fissure is generally shaped like a triangular prism, its apex ~50’ above Level 2.
	* The prism extends downward 1,600’ through the Halls until leveling out at the floor of the chasm (9-1).
* At this level the chasm is noisy with life and activity. 
	* The warmth given off by the Floating Garden (6-4) and the moisture from the waterfalls ensures abundant plant and insect life.
	* Creepers, vines, lichen mats, and so forth line the walls.
	* To the southeast, a nest of huge spiders has taken up residence in the bottleneck leading to the lesser chasm (6-101).

* Secret Door (to 6-19a, locked, -20% to pick): difficult to spot (1 in 8) from the chasm.

* Random encounters use the following table; 1-in-6 per 3 turns.

### 6-109: Stone Corridor 

* This stone corridor leads from the Great Pillar to the residential pod of the Beacon.
	* As per 6-103, the rudishva iris door leading to the Pillar is unusual, as it is wizard locked (12th level) and requires a key to open.
	* The corridor is dusty and absent signs of recent traffic.
	* Sounds of crunching metal are audible from the west.

### 6-110: Slagged Corridor with Xorn

* Here , where the corridor changes from stone to plasteel, a tremendous battle took place in antiquity.
* The plasteel walls and floor have buckled and melted, with burn and scorch marks around a 30’-deep pit of slagged plasteel.
	* In the center of the pit are 2 xorn, happily munching on the metallic bounty. 

2 xorn: SZ M; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 7+7; HP 55, 49; #AT 4; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-3/6-24. Special attacks: surprise on 1-5. Special defenses: immune to fire and cold; half damage from electricity; travel through stone.

### 6-111: Plasteel Corridor

* The corridor is plasteel, metallic and white, and conveys sound easily.
* A rudishva iris door leads to the residential pod.
	* Opens to a brown, sky blue, pale green, orange, pink, silver, or yellow ID plaque.
	* The wall around the door is grey plassteel, not quite as smooth (micro-pitted).
		* Added after the crash, not part of the original ship.
* A 5’-diameter hole has been slagged through the plasteel of the south wall, east of the door to 6-112.
	* A rope hangs through the hole into area 6-112, held in place by an ‘x’ made of two 6’ pieces of wood nailed together.
	* GM Note: the Bad Neighbors (6-113) made the hole with their laser rifle and used the rope to shimmy down into 6-112.
### 6-112: Cavern with Residential Pod and Access to SL4-28

* One of the residential pods from the Beacon dominates this large cavern.
	* In the crash, it was driven (half-out of phase) through the rock materializing and leaving a burn hole extends upward 475’ to SL4-28. 
	* The floor of the cavern has been levelled, but its walls remain rough rock.
	* The cavern is warm due to pod's energy emission.  Numerous vines, creepers, lichens, and molds grow here.
		* Creepers grow up and enshroud the pod, and can be climbed to the roof.
		* A pack of vicious subterranean lizards resides here.  They hunt using the vines and creepers for height and surprise.
	* The grey plasteel residential pod is 40’ tall, resting on several sets of sturdy tripod legs.
		* The pod's south end was corroded away in antiquity (by the sumuksu , still in 6-121), leaving an 8’x15’ hole 25’ up from the cavern floor. 

7 subterranean lizards: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 45, 42, 39, 37, 36, 33, 32; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: double damage on a natural roll to hit of 20.

### 6-112a: Heqeti Statue and Tunnel to 9-39

* Squatting on a ledge overlooking the cavern is a heqeti statue.
	* Lacking the potency of the ancient pukel-manders, it is an 8’ tall statue carved from soapstone of a salamander-thing with powerful legs and a salamander head.
	* Its over-sized eyes are disks of quartz (50 gp each).
	* Behind the statue, a tunnel wends its way downward to 9-39. 

### 6-113: Residential Pod of the Beacon, Upper Level

* The pod can be accessed either through the door to 6-111 or the corroded hole leading to 6-112; both entrances lead to the upper level of the residential pod.
	* All structural surfaces are white plasteel, with interior walls featuring decorative swooshes and swirls in a variety of primary colors.
	* The hallway is dirty, scattered with trash, lizard skins, and numerous bones (mostly from small animals).
	* A 3’-wide, sickening-brown smear of partly melted plasteel runs down the center of the hallway and up to each door.
		* GM Note: produced by the sumuksu, still residing in 6-121).
	* The nuclear reactor for this pod is still active (6-123) and lighting is still operational throughout the residential pod.
		* LED strips run along the corridor ceilings.  30' segments will be motion-activated weight >25 lb on the deck.
* The oval central chamber of the pod contains two null-grav holes in the floor leading to the lower level.
	* One steps into the hole, gives a shove, and levitates downward to emerge at 6-118. 

* The Bad Neighbors, a party of evil NPC adventurers, lurk in the corridor just north of the central chamber.
	* Members include: Klibo, Haldor, Idris One-Eye, Uriel Bean, Wotar the Puny, and Qid of Qon
	* They acquired two laser rifles, using them to cut the hole at 6-111 and to drive off the lizards of 6-112.
	* They used a Reduce (reverse of Enlarge) to squeeze between the cavern wall of 6-112 and the bulkhead of the residential pod.
	* If they hear intruders, they prepare an ambush with spells and laser fire.
	* Their base camp is located at 6-129.

### 6-114: Crew Quarters (x8)

* These eight chambers are roughly egg-shaped, with a lack of 90-degree angles.
	* Doors are 6’-diameter iris doors, all jammed ‘open’ since antiquity.
	* Entering a chamber illuminates it with a peaceful yellow glow from a hanging fixture.
	* A 2’-wide smear of brown corrosion runs through each open door and into the center of each room; a product of the sumuksu (6-121).
* Each chamber contains a pair of wall-mounted bunk beds mounted over a desk, two wardrobes, and a vacuum sink; these are built into the wall.  Two orange hard-plastic chairs affixed to the floor (25% chance the adhesive has deteriorated, 25 gp each).
	* All movable furnishings were stripped long time ago, and there is a jumble of trash (desiccated vines, broken bits of plasteel, fragments of parchment, small bones, and bits of leather gear).
		* Each turn of searching has 25% chance of finding something from the chart (max two finds per chamber, results can't repeat in different rooms).

D20 Item Notes

	* Refers to the sumuksu (6-121) that compromised the living quarters. Also contains a hint as to the culpability of the kaliyani in the downfall of the rudishva.

### 6-115: Empty Officers’ Quarters (x2)

* These two rooms are larger versions of the crew quarters (6-114), clad in white plasteel, with wall-mounted bed and a desk, closet, and orange plastic chair all affixed to the floor.
	* The doors to both chambers have been eaten open by some corrosive agent, leaving a jagged, 4’-diameter entrance and tell-tale brown smear of corrosive leading into each chamber (the sumuksu in 6-121).
	* Littered with trash (searching is 50% likely per turn to turn up one of the items from the table at 6-114).

### 6-116: Officer’s Quarters, Occupied

* Identical to 6-115 (complete with corroded ‘door’), except it has become the lair of an enormous boa constrictor.
	* The boa perches on the wall-mounted bed.  It has a good chance of surprising any but the most cautious of explorers.
* The floor of the chamber is littered with even more litter, much of it bones.
	* Among the bones are scattered 35 sp, 47 gp, and 14 pp.

1 giant constrictor snake: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6+1; HP 39; #AT 2; Dmg 1-4/2-8. Special attacks: constriction.

### 6-117: Officer’s Quarters, Intact

* The iris door to this chamber is intact and opens to a sky blue, silver, or yellow identity plaque.
	* No smear of brown corrosion enters this chamber.
* The basic features of the chamber are identical to those in 6-115.
	* The desiccated corpse of Mol-Prev, the Beacon’s Morale Officer, hangs by a noose attached to the light fixture.
		* He committed suicide when the sumuksu (6-121) breached the hull and the heqeti assault commenced.
	* Desk:
		* Two holo-cubes (personal pictures of Mol-Prev in a variety of formal (full-dress uniform) and informal (carousing with mates) poses) (500 gp each)
		* One bracelet from a pair of communication bracelets; the other is in SL6-55)
		* A GnuCoder 3000 Data Recorder
		* Drawer 1: three fully-charged lesser power supplies and two blank data crystals for the GnuCoder.
		* Drawer 2: a plastic box with twelve data-crystals

	* Closet:
		* 4 orange jumpsuits (sized for 7’-tall beings), a formal uniform (two piece, orange and blue, with a variety of mission stripes on the sleeves)
			* In the pocket of the dress uniform is a note (Glyphis): “Mol-Prev, Our GnuCoder 5000 has ceased operation. Can you fix it? Since ours is on the fritz, I believe that the machine in the Captain’s Library, near the Cloister, is the only remaining location that can handle our viewing crystals. As it’s quite inconvenient to travel there all the time, I hope you will consider a brief trip to the alchemical pits in order to repair my team’s GnuCoder. It would be a shame, both for morale and for intelligence purposes, if all of our data crystals were to remain unwatchable. (signed) Psalor-Ki.”
				* GM Notes: a hint to the use of data-crystals, the location of an operable GnuCoder 5000 (the library, 5-97), points to the domain of Psalor-Ki, once alchemical chief, now a deranged vivisectionist (5-66 to 5-75).
		* A leather pouch (brown, sky blue, and platinum identity plaques.
		* A rubberized party mask of a grinning varumani.

### 6-118: Residential Pod of the Beacon, Lower Level

* For many centuries, the entire lower level of the Residential Pod has been the lair of a horrendous sumuksu, a spawn of Rimmaq-Isfet (new).
	* Deriving energy from the nuclear generator in 6-123, where its primary protoplasm resides, it has poured its slime through the LED strips into every corner of the level.
		* Most surfaces are slimy and viscous.
		* The greater slime generated subsidiary slimes, dripping from the overhead lighting stripes, that animate living or dead creatures.
	* A small army of animated slime-zombies will attempt to overwhelm intruders and add their bodies to the greater slime’s forces.
	* The greater slime has not been able to re-navigate the null-grav shaft, and is confined to the lower level of the residential pod.
* The central, oval area (6-118) of curved white plasteel has two eye-shaped ovals of grey plasteel marking the null-grav shafts.
	* One ascends to the upper level by entering a fields, kicking off, and arrives at 6-113.
	* The entire area reeks of acid, decay, and corroded plastics.
	* A 3’-wide smear of corroded brown plasteel leads from the western null-grav shaft north towards 6-120, then west into 6-121.
	* A score of smaller corrosive ‘burns’ mar the floor, and another score the wall; all the product of the slime creature.
	* Three 3’-diameter pools of quiescent purple slime dot the floor between the corpses of eight beings.
	* The LED strip lighting that runs through the center of the chamber (and hallways) is no longer a peaceful yellow, but a glistening, sickly purple, from which numerous drips seem about to fall.

* 1d4 rounds after any enter the lower level, 8 slime zombies lumber to their feet/paws and attack.  They are joined by fellows from 6-119 and 6-120 within 1d6 rounds.
* 2d4 heqeti slimes (of the flesh-animating sort) cling to the lighting strips, ready to drop on any plausible host (adventurer or a recently-slain slime zombie).

8 heqeti slime zombies (see new monsters): SZ S(x3), M(x3) and L(x2); AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2(x3), 4(x3), 6(x2); HP 42, 39, 29, 27, 14, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: slime infestation. Special defenses: immune to electricity.

Special attacks: flesh animating (covers flesh and kills victim in 4-7 rounds, then re-animates as a heqeti slime zombie - see new monsters); corrosive to metal, leather, and wood. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.
* These slimes vary in color and texture, although all are flesh animating; roll for types in new monster appendix.

### 6-119: Slime Covered Lounge

* This lounge contains a number of orange plastic chairs, settees and sofas arranged in clumps around small tables.
	* The north wall is a viewscreen, attuned to display the cavern outside (6-112).
	* The LED lighting strips are fewer, only along the east and west walls, for gentler light.
		* The strips drip slime like those in 6-118.
	* All furniture is covered with a thin layer of sticky slime.
	* Six slime zombies are draped about the room
		* They are likely encountered in 6-118, joining any combat there in 1-6 rounds.
 
6 heqeti slime zombies (see new monsters): SZ S(x2), M(x2) and L(x2); AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2(x2), 4(x2), 6(x2); HP 42, 39, 29, 27, 14, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: slime infestation. Special defenses: immune to electricity.

Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.
* These slimes vary in color and texture, although all are flesh animating.  Roll for types in new monster appendix.

### 6-120: Slime Covered Refectory

* This area used to be the refectory for the inhabitants of this pod.
	* In its center is a 4’ tall, oval counter with 16 food stations (see 5-109).
		* Each has a silver oval inset and curved yellow tube extending from the counter  over the plate. A row of six colored buttons occupies the front of each station.
		* Pressing buttons spurts various varieties of high-protein, high-vitamin, food paste from the nozzle (not very appetizing, but highly nutritious).
	* A dozen stools set into the floor line the east and west walls.
	* The north wall is a huge viewscreen displaying a live view of 5-94 (the Cloister).
	* The whole area is covered with a layer of sticky slime, and the lighting strips also drip slime.
* Six heqeti slime zombies occupy the room, though they will be drawn into combat at 6-118 in 1d6 rounds.

6 heqeti slime zombies (see new monsters): SZ S(x2), M(x2) and L(x2); AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2(x2), 4(x2), 6(x2); HP 42, 39, 29, 27, 14, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: slime infestation. Special defenses: immune to electricity.

Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold. These slimes vary in color and texture, although all are flesh animating; roll for types in new monster appendix.

### 6-121: Slime Central! (aka Game Room) 

* This former game room has been the home of a sumuksu for close to three millennia, ever since it helped the heqeti breach the residence pod and overwhelm the crewmembers still living here.
	* Both iris doors have been eaten open by the slime, leaving 5’-diameter holes as access points.
	* About a dozen lumps of mostly shapeless plasteel dot the chamber; former entertainment consoles corroded over the years by the slime creature.
		* A claw machine still works, once the slime covering it has been scraped away.
			* A rectangular table with clear plasteel top and a pair of joysticks.
				* AC 2, 50 hp.  If broken, it discharges electricity for 3d6 w/in 15'.
			* Putting in a token (a gold solidus works ideally) in the slot gives a try (5d6 under DEX) to claim a prize.  Three prizes remain:
				* Powder in a plastic sack; rehydrated, it acts as a potion of clairvoyance, with trippy hallucinatory side-effects.
				* A repli-cube (tech)
				* A communications bracelet (tech)
		* Lodged under a destroyed game table is an adventurer’s backpack.
			* Bag of holding (1,000 lb capacity): 10,000 ancient silver pennies, 1,250 ancient gold solidi, 320 ancient octagonal platinum coins; 6 scrolls  (monster summoning II, polymorph other, cloudkill, wall of force, anti-magic shell, spiritwrack).
		* A magic long sword (+4 defender) lies against the south wall.
	* Four slime zombies are scattered throughout the area, and four random heqeti slimes are moving along the ceiling.
	* A15’-diameter mound of mottled green-and-brown slime sits half in and half out the door to 6-123. The sumuksu!
		* Tracks of purple and brown slime run along the overhead lighting strips to the slime creature.
		* It will have been alerted by combat in 6-118, 6-119 or 6-120.

1 sumuksu (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 3; MV 30’; HD 10; HP 71; #AT 4; Dmg 2-8/2-8/2-8/2-8; MR 15%. Special attacks: engulf; create new slimes. Special defenses: corrode metal, wood, leather; half damage from cold and fire; immune to charm, hold, and all mind-based spells.

### 6-122: Exercise Room and Last Stand

* This exercise room was the site of the last stand of the rudishva crewmen surprised by the assault of the heqeti and the sumuksu.
	* The north lobe of the chamber has a set of rubberized mats and free weights.  The southern lobe has eight treadmills built into the floor, facing a now-inoperable view-screen on the southeast wall.
	* These areas drip with slime, and there are 4 slime zombies – 2 heqeti hoppers, 2 rudishva – in each lobe of the chamber.
		* They are barred from entering the hallway by 6-124 (see below). 
	* Both entrances to the 20’x10’ hallway in front of the door to 6-124 are clouded by a slight yellowish vapor, as if from a light mist.
		* The mist is harmless and provide a safe zone from heqeti slimes.
		* The vapor emanates from a thick, yellowish paste painted in a continuous band along the walls, floor and ceiling of each entrance to this corridor.
		* In the corridor lie the desiccated corpses of 8 rudishva and 1 kaliyani.
			* A plasteel bucket of quietly burbling yellow paste rests by their side; enough to cover a medium sized person or to paint a 6” x 40' stripe.
			* Bodies: laser rifle; 2 laser pistols; sonic fence; identity plaques (rust, brown, orange); a repli-cube; 3 lesser power supplies (1, 3, and 2 charges).

GM Notes
* The yellow paste (av items) is a biological, anti-slime agent developed secretly by the kaliyani after they began to plan the ‘great betrayal’ to protect themselves from their new ‘allies’, the heqeti and their slimes.
	* One kaliyani who remained loyal to the rudishva, Kesstak, stole a pot of this anti-slime material and hastened to the residential pod after the attack began.
	* Kesstak and the remaining rudishva painted the substance on the walls of the corridor, saving themselves from the slime creature.
	* Sadly, Captain Leil-Jor shut down the teleporter in 6-124 to avoid contamination, and Kesstak and the other rudishva gradually expired of thirst.
* If activated the repli-cube shows:
	* 1) A desperate battle between orange jumpsuited rudishva and various freshly-made rudishva slime zombies.
	* 2) Arrival of a kaliyani from the door (to 6-124) and excited discussion about the contents of the pail.

### 6-130: Tomb of Lucius Cornelius Scriptor: Antechamber

* A permanent illusion conceals the entrance from the chasm.
* This is the antechamber to the tomb of Lucius Cornelius Scriptor, protonotarius (chief administrative officer) of the great archon, Marius Tricotor (6-154).
	* The floor features a 15’x5’ mosaic of an Archontean face, oriented such that the top of the head is by the door to 6-131.
		* The face mosaic is remarkably detailed, with some tesserae shaped specially to fit their purpose, the lined face of a man (Lucius Cornelius Scriptor) in his 50’s or 60’s, with the typical Roman nose of the Archontean aristocracy, close-cropped hair, and several warts by his nose.
		* A magic mouth speaks (Mithric) if the mosaic is touched, the lips moving, repeating every 5 rounds.
			* Hail, Friend! Lucius the scriptor, of the Cornelius clan, rests within, happily surrounded by the ghosts of his ancestors. Let his service to unconquered Marius Tricotor, archon and imperator, stand as a record to his fidelity and service to Archontos. Lucius is tired. Importune him no more. Rather, let him rest!
	* A dozen 4’-tall basalt pillars line the south and west walls, topped with life-sized, lifelike, painted, marble busts of men and women (5 lbs, 200 gp to the Krakteros clan).  Each has a name scratched into the bottom.
		* 7 men and 5 women of the Cornelius clan, relatives of Lucius Scriptor.
			* Licinia Septima; Sixtus the Praetor; Junius the younger, Cornelia of the collegium, Mendax the Outcast, etc.. 
			* (4d6 under Int) Cornelian clan largely died out 500 years ago, with its remaining members subsumed into the Krakteros (one of the Five Families).
		* The bust of Mendax the Outcast s far more generic and stylized than the others (lacking crows-feet, moles, small scars, and other features that render the remaining busts so lifelike).
			* An internal compartment holds the key to the secret door to 6-133.
			* Stone-cunning or trap-finding might notice the weight is off.
	* Both doors are stone and locked (keys long gone).
	* Secret Door (south, -15% to pick, difficult): han unusual x-shaped keyhole (key inside the the bust of Mendax the Outcast).

### 6-131: Trapped Corridor

* The wooden door visible at the end of the long, narrow corridor is a false door.
	* If opened, a stone block drops from the ceiling by the real door to 6-130, completely blocking the corridor except for a 6” gap.
	* Detection (dwarves, 60%; thieves, +5% to spot but -10% disarm).

### 6-132: False Floor

* The north, south, and west walls of this chamber are painted with vibrant scenes of common persons and soldiers bringing treasures and tributes before a seated man depicted on the east wall.
* The center of the floor is painted with another image of Lucius Cornelius (not a mosaic, as in 6-130).
	* Just east of the image of Lucius Cornelius is an 8’x3’x4’ sarcophagus.
	* The floor is an illusion covering a 30’-deep pit. Only the ‘sarcophagus’ is real, the carved tip of a 30’-tall pillar.
		* The fall deals 3d6.  3d6 under DEX or hit sparse spikes (2d4).
		* Two hungry ghouls are also marooned in the pit.

	* The interior appears solid gold studded with precious and semiprecious stones
		* Actually fool’s gold and colored glass (3d6 under INT to notice).
		* A wrapped skeleton (not Lucius Cornelius) lies in state with a silver-and-ruby medallion of thought projection prominently displayed on its chest.
			* Disturbing it causes a ghostly spirit to follow the defiler, moaning dire but wordless imprecations and making their life miserable (-25% reaction rolls, hard to sneak, etc), until an exorcism spell is cast.
* Around the sarcophagus are a dozen pieces of large, gilt furniture, some stacked on top of each other.
	* 4 occasional tables, a delicate canopied bed, a set of campaigning furniture, 6 dining chairs. All is gilt (125 gp if stripped) and purely ceremonial.
	* By the west wall are a huge writing desk (6’ tall, 8’ wide) and a large scroll cabinet.
		* Both are formed of ivory-inlaid teakwood, functional and extremely valuable (1,500 gp and 300 gp respectively; 4d6 under INT to disassemble).
			* 4 scrolls in the case: a cursed scroll; the Lay of Marius Invictus, by Lucius Cornelius Scriptor (books); a scroll of protection from possession; and the Secreta Secretorum (books).
	* Two large stone chests lie against the south side of the sarcophagus.

		* On the south wall, it shows Lucius Cornelius sitting by a figure in sumptuous purple robes with a gold circlet and numerous gaudy pieces of jewelry.  Inscription (Mithric): “Thus the Scriptor aided the glorious Marius Tricotor in the acquisition and distribution of wealth.” 
			* This fresco is a red herring.  Anyone who knows about Marius Tricotor will  recognize Marius was a simple soldier first and always, and eschewed finery and acclaim.
* Secret Door (west wall of corridor, just outside the room proper): difficult to locate (1 in 8), no opening mechanism, can be shattered by 10 damage.

### 6-134: Stone Golem

* At the west end of this narrow chamber stands a stone golem, carved to resemble an Archontean legionary.
	* It activates when any living being ventures 20’ west of the door to 6-133.

### 6-135: Tomb of Lucius Cornelius Scriptor

	* Inscription (Mithric): “Lucius and Marius. Friends in life, friends in death. In simplicity there is truth.” 
* A sarcophagus lies against the west wall, undecorated save for the inscription “Lucius Cornelius, friend of Marius.”  (open doors to remove lid)
	* Inside is an alabaster urn (50 gp) that holds the ashes of Lucius Cornelius, as well as a carpet of 5,429 ancient silver pennies and 1,387 ancient gold solidi.
		* Amongst the coins are an ioun stone (pale lavender) and a silver circlet (helm of comprehend languages and read magic).
		* Ashes of Lucius Cornelius: if disturbed (or scattered), the defiler is geased to bring the bodies of 10 heqeti to the tomb of Marius Tricotor (6-154).

* The air is cool (45-degrees F).
* The floor is littered with brittle and desiccated bits of discarded adventuring gear.
* The south door (locked) is rimmed with frost and is extremely cold to the touch.
	* The lock is jammed with ice, and he door frozen shut (bend bars to force).

Your lordship, I do not know how to best phrase what must be said in this missive, so I will eschew the usual pleasantries and move directly to the point. You cannot trust Guivrel. She has been corrupted by that ring, which my master Pollitt found in the Hall of Forty Pillars and gave to her as a gift. It is cursed! Cursed, I tell you! Pollitt knew it well, which is why he allowed it to pass from his hands to your Guivrel. The ring changes a person’s thoughts, rendering the victim cruel, calculating, and enamored of treachery. I beg of you to force Guivrel to surrender the ring, and then to destroy it. Only then might she return to her usual good-natured self. Please take these words as they are intended: humble advice from a friend to a powerful lord.’
				* GM Note: a clue to the fate of Lankios, Guivrel and Kaitor (5-11), as well as to the nature of Pollitt (6-140).

	* The humps are the snow-covered boxes, barrels, and kegs.
	* A 5’-diameter hole on the east wall leads to natural tunnels and 6-125 and 6-127.

### 6-140: Chamber of the Frost Mother

* This dark and frigid chamber is the source of the ice and cold that dominates the surrounding caves, for a terrible frost mother is bound to this chamber.
* The entire room is covered with a foot of snow over several more inches of ice.
	* Six corpses lie half-buried among the crunchy snow.
	* A dais in the northwest corner, topped with a throne flanked by spiral-carved stone columns, is buried under a dramatic snow mound.

			* She regenerates 1 hp / Turn while surrounded by snow and ice.
			* If combat lasts > 3 rounds, frost ghouls start arriving from 6-137 (round 8), 6-138 (round 4) and 6-139 (round 6).

Background
* The frost mother was summoned by the Archontean sorcerer, Pollitt, during the ill-fated imperial effort to reclaim the halls 250 years ago.
* The mage’s frozen body has lain under the snow at the foot of the throne for centuries, but the frost mother is unable to return to the para-elemental plane of ice.
* Marooned and increasingly unstable, she has created an environment suited to her native plane and has populated it with the frost ghouls created from the corpses of those unfortunates who have died at her hands. 

After the Ice has Thawed
* The wall frescoes on the walls are illegible, but a fine floor mosaic remains.
	* It shows an authoritative-looking Archontean dressed in ordinary legionary attire and identified as “Marius” receiving the homage of a half-dozen warriors and officials, all dressed in glittering finery.

	* Pollitt’s spell book has been mostly destroyed by the cold
		* Still legible: conjure elemental, dolor, monster summoning III, and geas.

GM Notes: Pollitt abandoned his post in Adrienic's command (5-18), the imperial archon sent 250 years ago to recover the halls, and stole the bowl of controlling water elementals. The note is from Lankios, who still lives as a hermit (1-6).

	* Carved from basalt, and quite lifelike.  Archaic, but distinct, facial features, articulated splint mail.
	* If the Oath of Loyalty to the Emperor (hidden under ice on the wall) is recited, drinking the water acts as a potion of super-heroism and heals 2d6, once per month.
	* Drinking without reciting the oath tastes bitter and has no effect, and the four stone statues animate and attack
* Four 8’-tall statues of Archontean legionaries stand against the slanted walls of the chamber.

After the Ice has Thawed
* North wall: a 2’-tall inscription (Mithric) filled with gold (100 gp, 2 hours to pry out)
	* Imperator! With faith and strength I uphold your authority and obey your rightful commands. Imperator!
		* Reciting this oath here activates the beneficial effects of the fountain. 
* Secret Door (southeast, beside stone legionary): invisible under snow and ice. Once thawed, detect normally. Opens by simply pushing a 4’-square panel inwards.

4 stone legionaries, as Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 45, 40, 35, 33; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%.

## Level 6: 143 - 168

### 6-143: Spillway from the Drowned Canyon (SL6-25)

* This passage allows overflow water from the dam at the east end of the Drowned Canyon (SL6-25) to pour into the Great Chasm (6-108).
	* For most of its length, the spillway is 40’ wide, 4’ tall, and semicircular, with natural stone walls, but a flat, smoothed granite floor, slippery with moss in many places.
	* 150’ from the chasm, the spillway changes direction and narrows to a 10’-diameter tube that extends to the edge of the chasm, where water running through it forms a steady waterfall (6-6a).
	* The pitch is gentle, 20 degrees in the wider part, 25 degrees in the narrower section. A cautious party should have little trouble traversing the spillway.
	* 50’ west of where the narrow section widens out, a breach in the roof of the spillway leads to a 5’ tunnel snaking north and west to 6-159.

### 6-144: Stairs Down to SL13-27 (Lost Chambers of Arden)

* The secret door in 6-142 leads to a 4’-wide passage and stairs down 350’ to SL13-27.
	* It is impossible to open from the east side until 6-142 is thawed.

### 6-145: Shrine to Marius

* The stone door is locked, but easy to pick (+5%).
* This was the public shrine to the great archon, Marius Tricotor.
	* It portrays Marius like an Archontean aristocrat, consumed with desire for status and appropriate honor. Those familiar with Marius will know his usual depiction as a man of simplicity who eschewed formality and luxury.
* The chamber is 20’ tall and barrel vaulted.
	* The floors and ceilings are painted imperial purple.  All statues are painted to resemble actual flesh, clothing, and equipment.
	* The entire room detects of magic. 
	* A dais (15’ long, 10’ wide, 5’ tall) dominates the center of the room. Behind it is a 15’ statue of Marius Tricotor and his adoring secretary, Lucius Cornelius.
		* A short stair leads up on the south end to a top sheathed in blue marble.
		* When the top is touched, a magic mouth speaks from the central statue.
			* (Mithric) “I am Marius Tricotor the Great. My nobility was recognized early in my career, and I received the promotions I deserved. Here, at Arden Vul, I received the homage of the troll thegn and devised and executed the plan that drove back the hopping hordes of the slimy dwellers in the dark. For this I received appropriate honors and ruled as archon, enjoying the friendship of the Emperor himself. I am truly worthy to be listed among the Twenty. My loyal friend, Lucius Cornelius, wrote the true account of my deeds and chose to entomb himself nearby.”
			* GM Note: ‘the Twenty’ refers to the Worthies of the Archontean Empire.
		* The main statue of Marius stands with right arm outstretched, cloaked in a purple-trimmed white toga draped to leave the right shoulder bare.
			* His visage is stylized and generic; unlined, unblemished, smiling thinly.
			* He wears a heavy gold circlet studded with red gems and 3 thick gold rings.  Cradled in his left arm is a pair of fasces. Sheathed by his right side is a legionary gladius.
				* The rings, short sword, and toga are removable, but non-valuable, painted, sculptural items.
			* Inscribed on the south side of the pediment (Mithric): “the Great Archon, Marius Tricotor.”
		* A man kneels next to him, looking up with awe at Marius.
			* A smaller inscription on the east side: “Lucius Cornelius, scribe and confidant, recipient of the relics of the great man.” ( Lucius Cornelius’s tomb is at 6-135)
			* Lucius Cornelius is less elaborate, without removable garb.
			* The head is hollow, removable by twisting.
				* Inside is a folded parchment (Mithric): “Lucius Cornelius received the armor and sword of Marius Tricotor, and added them to his collection. Now they are gone, hidden in the scriptor’s tomb, which that suspicious ingrate has concealed from all.” (see 6-135)
	* Six more 10’ sculptures line the walls, each standing on a 2’ semicircular dais.
		* The six groupings that line the wall depict stages of Marius' career.
			* In each Marius and other figures appears in a highly idealized way.
		* From the southeast corner, the sculptural scenes depict:
			* 1) Marius the Legionary: a young man, attired as a common legionary, standing at attention.
				* The only acknowledgement that Marius was a commoner who rose through the ranks (instead of the mythmaking of the rest of the iconography).
			* 2) Marius the Kentarch: uniformed as a commander of 100 men, pointing with his javelin towards an imagined enemy.
			* 3) Marius in ceremonial armor receiving the fealty of the troll thegn: extending his left hand which a writhing, skinny varumani kisses humbly.
			* 4) Marius Invictus, trampling the heqeti: in ceremonial armor and holding a baton of office, steps on the neck of a heqeti hopper. 
			* 5) Marius the Archon: dressed in elaborate courtier’s garb, rendering judgment on a kneeling man
			* 6) Marius and the Emperor, both dressed resplendently: bows slightly before the emperor, who places a hand of friendship on his shoulder.
	* Secret Door (ceiling): a circular door, 10’ in diameter, in the ceiling.
		* Opens when one gold ring on the central statue’s hand is twisted. Leads to a broad but low (4’-tall) passage to 6-146.

* If the chamber door is left open, the inhabitants of 6-157 will investigate in 4 rounds.

* GM Note: The broad outline of Marius’s career is accurately told here. It is the insistence on Marius’s natural nobility and typically aristocratic predilection for deference and honor that deviates from reality.

### 6-146: Ceiling Bolt Hole

* This chamber is only 4’ tall and is rough-carved from the rock, one of the few navigable routes between the eastern portion of Level 6 and the tomb of Marius Tricotor (6-154).
	* A 10’-diameter hole in the floor leads to the ceiling of the corridor between 6-148 and 6-154.
	* The southward tunnel ends in a 10’-diameter circular hatch into the ceiling of 6-145.
	* A dry and cracked leather haversack lies on the floor of the chamber
		* Coil of silk rope, an ancient terra cotta plaque stamped with an image of the archon, Marius Tricotor (15 gp).

### 6-147: Sub-Archon’s Quarters

* An imperial sub-archon oversaw an official honor guard for Marius Tricotor’s tomb (6-154) from this location.
	* The sub-archon and his men swore binding oaths to protect the tomb with their lives, and so the last unit of these guards remains at its post.
	* The door is locked (+10% to pick); the one key lies within.
* The chamber is painted sky blue, with green laurel wreaths (an imperial symbol) at 3’ intervals.
	* A 5’-tall writing desk stands at the center of the room.
	* To the west is a wooden screen, behind which is a cot, wardrobe, and armor stand.
		* Wardrobe: badly decayed wool and linen clothing, 2 usable yellow silk surcoats with the letters MI embroidered on front and back (MI = Marius Invictus).
		* Armor stand: yellow-died legionary banded mail +1, a short sword +2, and a bundle of 4 javelins of piercing. 
	* To the east is a long, rectangular table on which are tacked some maps.
		* The maps on the table include the following: 1) a map of Burdock’s Valley; 2) a map of the city of Arden Vul; and 3) a map of the environs of the Tomb of Marius Tricotor (areas 6-5, 6-136 to 6-142, and 6-145 to 6-148). 
	* A narrow table on the north wall holds some symbolic objects.

### 6-148: Barracks Chamber

* The walls are sky-blue, with yellow helmets painted over the blue every 3’.
	* The sleepless guardsmen pushed the 12 rotting wooden bunkbeds to the south. 
		* Among the debris is a rotting chest: 1,311 ancient silver pennies, a scroll of extension II, a wand of frost (12 charges).
* Thanks to their eternal oath, the elite guard still stands watch in the guardsmen’s former barracks as oathbound knights (new).
	* Dressed in yellow-died banded mail and tattered yellow surcoats with the MI insignia (see 6-147). 
	* They stand quietly, ready to repel desecrators of the tomb of Marius Tricotor (6-154) or the areas of east of the tomb.  They confront anyone who opens the door from 6-154 or who descends from the hole to 6-146.
		* Intruders have only a couple of rounds to convince them (in Mithric) that their purpose does not involve disrespect, plunder, or desecration.
		* They don't attack anyone who presents a true artifact of Marius (e.g., his sword or armor from 6-135).
		* If the talismans of their oaths (see 6-149), they crumble into dust.

8 oathbound knights (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LN; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 47, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 37; #AT 3/2; Dmg 3-9 (broadsword), 3-6 (horseman’s flail), 1-4 (light crossbow); 
MR 25%. Special attacks: +1 to hit, +1 damage. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit. Possessions: chain mail; broadsword; light flail; light crossbow, 20 quarrels.

Publius Lanlius, the oathbound knight-commander (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LN; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 9; HP 63; #AT 3/2; Dmg 5-12 (long sword +3); MR 25%. Special attacks: +1

* Folded parchment w/ address of Thothian teleportation ring at SL4-49 (black - red - yellow-green-blue-white).

### 6-149: Repository of the Oaths

* Secret Door (from hallway, locked, -5% to pick): key held by the oathbound commander (6-148).
* This long, barrel-vaulted room has a 20’ ceiling, with ceiling and walls painted sunflower yellow.
	* Words (Mithric) in bold black paint on the east and west walls: Discipline, Order, Loyalty, Fidelity, and Service.
	* Stone benches fill the northern two-thirds of the chamber.
	* At the south end is an obsidian shrine on a dais 2’ tall, 10’ wide, and 8’ across.
		* The north edge of the platform contains an apparently solid 5’ cube of obsidian.
			* Each side is inscribed and filled with silver (Mithric): “The Archon’s Heart is Worthy of Service.”
			* The top also has an 3/4” silver-lined indentation.
			* If the ring of Marius (new, borne by the commander in 6-148) is inserted, the obsidian cube slides back, revealing a 1’-square hole in the platform holding the the mummified heart of Marius, wrapped in linen.
				* A parchment tag on the wrap reads (Mithric): “This is the Heart of Marius Tricotor, taken from his body when the archon died.”
		* Behind the cube, at the platform's rear is a half pillar, 3’ in diameter and 5’ high.
			* On top is a finely carved, hyper-realistic marble bust of Marius Tricotor.
				* Attached to the bust by string are nine small talismans.
					* These are tokens of the oaths sworn by the oathbound knights (6-148); if destroyed, the corresponding knight crumbles to dust.
					* Ordinary knight talismans: a lock of hair; a cameo with a man’s head; a small knife; a scrap of parchment with the name “Gnaeus” on it; a terra cotta icon of Marius Tricotor; a cheap necklace of copper and glass (5 gp); a small vial with dried blood; and another small vial with a desiccated human finger (pinky) in it.
					* Commander’s talisman: gold amulet set with carnelians (375 gp).

### 6-150: Empty Guardpost

* A few benches, a table, and ancient pewter mugs are all that remain of this guard post.
* A faded fresco on the south wall shows a yellow-clad legionary under the motto (Mithric): “By our oath we show our service to Emperor and Archon!”

### 6-151: Robing Room

* This 15’-tall room is painted bright yellow and studded with pegs for hanging clothes.
	* A few shreds of yellow silk hang from a few of the pegs.
	* Over the exit to the south is a faded slogan in yellow paint (Mithric): “Fidelity to our Lord Marius.”
* GM Note: Imperial custodians of the tomb of Marius Tricotor always wore a yellow surcoat with the initials “MI” (Marius Invictus); those arriving from what are now the Flooded Vaults (Sub-Level 7) stopped here to dress. 

### 6-152: Stairs to Surface (AV-27)

* This narrow (5’-wide), circular staircase wends its way upward  1,200’ to a secret door in the basement of the Carrion Tower of the Donjon in the Ruined City (AV-27).

### 6-153: Stairs and Corridor to SL7-6

* A set of stairs descends briefly before turning into a corridor west, which then ascends 250’ over many short staircases to the Flooded Vaults (SL7-6).

### 6-154: Tomb of Marius Tricotor

* One of the legendary lost locations of the Halls, isolated from most traffic for a millennium since the passage to 6-157 collapsed.
* The chamber is 30’ tall and barrel vaulted.
	* Eight statues (10’ tall) of legionaries stand along the east and west walls. 
	* To the south a 10’-wide passage leads south, only to end in a cave-in. 
	* At the north edge of the chamber is a colossal carved head of Marius Tricotor; 15’ tall, 6’ in diameter and mounted on a 5’-square pedestal.
		* The base of the pedestal carries an inscription in Mithric.
		* It is carved of marble in elaborate detail, down to the last hair, wrinkle, and blemish, showing a man of late middle age, with close cropped hair, a broken Roman nose, pursed lips, and sharp, penetrating eyes made of  basalt chips.
		* Approaching within 5’ triggers a magic mouth that intones (Mithric):
			* “Only those who know me well may summon me to their side. Restore those objects that symbolize my nature, and I shall return to aid you in your need. Choose poorly, and your ignorance and lack of faith shall be punished!”
		* Placing the suitable objects on the four basalt platforms summons the spirit of Marius Tricotor to inhabit his head for 4-6 days (see below).
	* Down the center are four basalt platforms, each 5’ long, 10’ wide, and 3’ tall.
		* The sides of each platform are inscribed with one of Marius' virtues in gold filled (Mithric) letters.
		* On top of each platform is an 8’-tall, marble half-statue of Marius: torso, arms, hands, and head.
			* Each ‘statue’ has indentations in the same locations: skull (10” diameter), eyes (4” ovals), and chest (12” diameter).
			* If any incorrect item (e.g. ‘false’ items from 6-145) is placed on any of the half-statues, 2 stone legionaries per wrong object animate and attack.

Virtue Distinctiveness Solution
* 1) Fidelity
	* The statues’ arms are outstretched and the fingers of both its hands are open and outstretched.
		* Roll 4d6 under INT to notice wear on the right ring finger. 
	* Place the ring of Marius (currently in 6-148) on any of Marius’s fingers. 
* 2) Protection
	* Hands are held at the torso's waist, fingers of both are closed as if to grip something.
	* Those who wear armor can roll 4d6 under INT to notice wear marks where the straps to attach armor should be. 
	* Attach the armor of Marius (6-135) on the torso.
* 3) Vengeance
	* The torso is slightly swiveled and the left arm is thrust forward. The fingers of both hands are closed as if to grip something.
	* Any sword-wielding PC may roll 4d6 under INT to detect wear marks in the right hand. 
	* Place the sword of Marius (6-135) in the left hand.
* 4) Nobility
	* Both arms are folded behind the torso’s back.
	* Place the heart of Marius (6-149) in the indentation in the torso’s chest.

Spirit of Marius Tricotor
* If all four of the correct symbolic objects are placed on the appropriate torsos, the spirit of Marius will return to possess the colossal head.
* It speaks in Mithric through the head’s mouth, starting with the following:
	* “I’m here. Why have you ripped me across the veil?”
* The spirit eschews the aristocratic tones favored by the previous magic mouth, and speaks Mithric in a common, even lower class, accent.  Marius is blunt and direct, caring nothing for niceties or circumlocutions.
* If treated politely, he is a font of potentially useful information and wisdom.
	* He can describe in detail the campaigns against the heqeti, as well as the characteristics and powers of the various heqeti types.
	* He has spirit-knowledge of the locations of the iconic objects attributed to him in the Lay of Marius Invictus (books), and can also provide directions to these locations, so long as the route passes through Archontean-era construction.
		* The ancient sky sled (the remaining ones are at 6-4, 6-100, and 7-36)
		* The iron circlet of Ghanor (3-127A)
		* The bone ring of Jagri-Naz (5-74)
		* The ebon spear (SL5-13B)
		* The tablet of the Beacon (9-107).
	* He can describe the original functions and layout of the Archontean areas (Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, parts of 5, parts of 6, and Sub-Levels 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7).
	* If asked about treasure, and if convinced it will be put to lawful purposes, he will reveal a hidden catch on the fourth platform that causes it to slide, revealing a short flight of stairs to a treasure vault.
		* 10 5-lb bars of platinum (1,250 gp each); an urn with 2,347 ancient silver pennies; a set of gold and emerald jewelry (necklace, earrings, and ring; total 5,000 gp); a suit of imperial field plate (av items); a rod of lordly might; a vorpal blade (long sword); a description of the troll thegn’s court (7-72 to 7-77) and his submission to Marius Tricotor. 
	* Marius’s spirit remains for 4-6 days.
		* At the end of that period, Marius cuts short any conversation with the following words: “Comrades, I’ve got to go. Carry yourself with honor and dignity, and always press the bastards when they least expect it. Look for me again after the full moon.”
		* He can be re-summoned after two months have passed.

8 stone legionaries, as Archontean animated constructs – spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 45, 42, 40, 39, 38, 37, 35, 33; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.

### 6-155: Lawful Propaganda Chamber

* This former meditation chamber has seen hard times, stripped of all furnishing.
	* A set of slogans (Mithric) is carved into the wall above now-destroyed frescoes.
		* Six slogans occupy the walls, one per 10’ section (except the section with the secret door).
			* Discipline makes one strong
			* Loyalty is its own reward
			* Death before dishonor
			* Order breeds happiness
			* Good lordship starts with good discipline
			* The Wise servant obeys without question
		* GM Note: the slogans obviously privilege principles of law over chaos. Although intended for general purposes by the Imperial authorities, they may also hint as to the alignment tendencies of the magic pool in 6-156.
	* Secret Door (north): easy to find (1 in 4), opens by pushing the ‘w’ of the word ‘wise’ in the sixth slogan (searching might detect wear around that letter).

### 6-156: Magic Pool

* The stairs and corridor lead to a pleasant, hemispherical chamber, whose walls and floor are tiled in pale green tiles.
	* A three-tiered fountain occupies almost all of the room, filled with bright yellow liquid that cascades invitingly down. 
	* The fountain is a magic pool. 
		* Drinking a draught provokes a roll on the following table; the results differ according to the drinker’s alignment:

### 6-157: Antechamber 

* This 20’-tall antechamber was the visitor's entry to the tomb of Marius Tricotor (6-154).
	* Four 12’-tall, half-round, granite carvings of legionaries are attached to the east and west walls, one each on either side of the east-west corridors.
	* The center of the room holds a 4’-tall, triangular dais made of striated marble.
		* In the center stands the spectral form of a legionary.
			* On entry, the legionary points north declaims slowly and loudly (Mithric):  “Seek the great Marius Tricotor down that corridor. Be prepared to offer him fealty, and he in turn will defend and protect you.”
			* Recent smears of blood are visible on the floor around the dais (the remains of the adventurers being devoured in 6-159).
	* The 10’-wide passage to the north is impassable due to an ancient cave-in.
		* GM: the only access the tomb of Marius Tricotor (6-154) the secret door in the ceiling of 6-145.
* Two bestial varumani are growling and pawing at the door to the south.
	* They attack any intruders on sight. More than four rounds of combat draws the other varumani in 6-159 and 6-160 to the fray, arriving on round 7.

* A band of 8 varumani who abandoned their fealty to the troll thegn makes its lair here.
	* Seven bestial, semi-intelligent varumani are led by a lesser varumani outcast, Bothig.
	* The reek of their lair is obvious from 30’ down the corridor.
* The chamber was once a pleasant, 20’-tall barrel-vaulted audience hall.

### 6-160: Ruined Dining Hall … with Varumani

* Two bestial varumani from Bothig’s band of renegades (6-159) wait on either side of the tunnel from 6-161 to ambush any prey that might emerge. 
* A 20’-long, heavy oaken table still stands in the center of the room, devoid of chairs.
	* A pile of bones (the past meals of the varumani) sits in the southwest corner.
	* The east wall bears a faded fresco in which Marius Tricotor, dressed in ordinary legionary armor, stands at the center of group of legionaries.

	* It was bored by Kerbog Khan’s borer automaton (see SL12-19).
	* The slope of the passage is just gentle enough to allow bipeds to traverse it without slipping (+3x difficult terrain or risk slipping).

### 6-162: Rudishva Transport Hall

* The iris door to 6-163 opens to pale green, pink, orange, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaques. 
* This ancient rudishva hall has no right angles, and is sheathed in hexagonal white tiles.
	* Most of the chamber is taken up by a 15’-diameter, 3’-deep black granite fountain.
		* The liquid in the fountain is opalescent and sparkly. Anything (or anyone) coated in the liquid can levitate in the shaft (6-164). 
	* Teleport Nodes 
		* Silvery disks on the floor and a silvery square inset on the wall. Touching the square teleport one on the pad to the appropriate location.
		* T14: access to 5-31
		* T16: access to 7-6 (floating garden)

### 6-163: Giant Rudishva Skeletal Guardians

* The door to 6-162 is one of the rudishva iris doors, and only opens by presenting a pale green, pink, orange, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items). 
* This 15’-tall chamber is sheathed in hexagonal white tiles, with no right angles.
	* Two granite chairs occupy the center of the room, angled so both face the entry point from 6-164.  Each chair holds a giant rudishva skeleton.
		* Anyone exiting the transit shaft (6-164) is met with a harsh challange (rudishva), and mercilessly attacked if they don't immediately present a pale green, orange, pink or silver rudishva identity plaque.
	* An 8’-square hole in the west wall provides access to the transit shaft.

2 semi-intelligent giant rudishva skeletons: SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68, 55; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%. Special attacks: bone 
throwing; sonic blast. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from sharp or edged weapons; half damage from fire; immune to sleep, charm, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### 6-164: Transit shaft, with Impaled Dwarf

* A 40’-square shaft, sheathed in white marble and silver grout, extends 1,100’ through the Halls, commencing at 5-84 and culminating at 9-91 (~500' below).
	* Built  as swift transport for rudishva officers, it detects as strongly magical.
	* Things coated in the opalescent liquid is capable of levitation in the pit (20' / round).
	* Removal of even 10% of the silver grout cancels the levitation effect.
	* From this point one can use the shaft to access 5-84, 7-146 and 9-91.
	* The opening to 6-163 is obvious and easily accessible to those traversing the shaft. 
* The body of a dwarf is impaled against the east wall of the chasm by monstrous femurs.
	* A victim of the giant rudishva skeletons at 6-163.
	* Dwarf-sized chain mail, battle axe +1, 50’ coil of rope, 10 spikes, a potion of healing, an inert dwarven life-stone from the clan Goethite, sack full of desiccated bits of fruit.

### 6-165: Ooze Chamber with Pukel-mander

* The northern and eastern of the chamber are worked in the heqeti manner, with pebbled, oily walls. 
	* An enormous gray ooze typically inhabits the southern, natural lobe of the cave.
		* If encountered in 6-161, it might not be here. 
	* To the east, down the partly finished corridor, a pukel-mander (new) looms over the cave at 6-166. 
* The central feature of the cave is an enormous pool of roiling and burping slimes of different colors and consistencies.
	* The slime pit is about 10’ deep and roughly 20’ in diameter, filled with several noxious slimes extruded by Rimmaq-Isfet itself and imported from the Abyss.
	* Unlike the comparable pool at 5-104, this one never produced the right combination of slimes for the attack on the rudishva, and the heqeti abandoned it. 
	* At any given time 4 heqeti slimes are visible on the surface of the pool.
		* Every hour of waiting, 75% chance one slime will submerge and 1d2 new ones will rise to the surface. 

1 electric blue, liquid but adhesive heqeti slime (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 5’ creeping; HD 2; HP 10; #AT 1; Dmg special; MR 15%. Special attacks: touch causes painful

### 6-166: Crossroads Cave, with tunnels to 5-100, SL6-56, and the Chasm (6-108)

* Stalactites and stalagmites dot this 30’-tall cavern.
	* A tunnel to the northwest slopes upward to 5-100.
	* One to the east slopes gently down to the Great Chasm (6-108).
	* A third tunnel, difficult to locate and only 3’ in diameter, is near the ceiling of the northeast wall; it leads up to SL6-56 of the Drowned Canyon.
* At the west end of the cave is a ledge containing a heqeti pukel-mander (see 6-165).
	* At the foot of the ledge is the corpse of a human magic user.

### 6-167: Cave of Gimon
 
* This small cave is the abode of the strange creature known as Gimon (new).
* Gimon abides here (present 50%), in a surprisingly well-kept cave.
	* On a ledge in the back of the cave is the idol of Camazotz (new).
	* Next to it is a forgotten purse with 10 impressive pearls (120 gp each).

Gimon (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’, 150’ flying (Class D); HD 6; HP 40; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6; MR 25%. Special defenses: cannot be surprised; immune to cold.
* Gimon was a human adventurer who found the potent idol of Camazotz (new) and fell under its spell. After several months of possessing it, he transformed into a bat creature.
* He is bipedal, quite skinny, with arms connected to his body with bat wings and  impressive fangs.
* Despite his monstrous appearance, Gimon is not evil; he is probably insane, though.
	* He flies about the middle levels of Great Chasm, feeding on other predators and occasionally rescuing the weak.
	* The workers at the Troll Lifts know him well and don’t bother him; refering to him, rather fondly, as the ‘Bat-monk’.  Despite their neutrality, Gimon is too skittish to form friendships with them.
* He will likely hear intruders before they enter his cave, and takes flight to avoid being trapped in his cave.
* As long as the idol of Camazotz remains untouched, he will not bother those who ransack his cave (although they will not be beneficiaries of his ‘rescue missions’).
	* He will pursue to the death anyone who carries off his idol.

### 6-168: Two-lobed Cave

* The front of this cave opens onto the chasm.  It is nondescript rock and the occasional home of chasm cephalopods (25% chance).
	* At the back is a narrow crack, 2’ wide and 4’ tall, leading to a second, larger cave.
* This section is drier, sandier and a fine place to rest without fear of attack.
	* Gimon knows of this cave and might recommend it to those whom he trusts.

4 medium chasm cephalopods (see new monsters) (25% chance): SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 4; HP 27, 26, 25, 24; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-
4/1-4/1-6; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.
