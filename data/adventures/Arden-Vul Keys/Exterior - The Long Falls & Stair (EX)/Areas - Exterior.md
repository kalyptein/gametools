### Overview

* The Halls of Arden Vul lie within an massive rock plateau that looms over the valley of the Swift River. From the top of the plateau, the Swift River drops 1,500’ to the valley floor in an enormous waterfall. Carved into the face of the cliff is a set of broad steps that winds upward through three cutbacks until it reaches the top of the plateau; this is the infamous Long Stair.

#### Approaching the Cliff

Yosemite Falls

* The Long Falls are visible on a clear day from many miles away on the verdant and temperate valley floor, appearing as a thin stream of white against the grey and green of the cliff face.
* They are audible from three miles away as a dull buzzing sound in the distance.
	* At two miles it becomes a sustained white noise as loud as a person speaking.
	* At one mile the white cloud of mist and moisture roughly 200 yards in diameter becomes evident, and the sound is loud enough to impede conversation.
	* Beneath the falls conversation is almost impossible, and the sound is as loud as a freight train among the smell of the damp, mold, and mildew.
	* Everything within 500’ of the Falls is slick with moisture.
		* Movement is halved within this radius, and combats taking place on slick surfaces impose -2 attack and -1 to DEX checks.
	* At the edge of the falls’ basin, the rocks are covered with slippery moss; those climbing on the rocks will be hard pressed to keep their footing.
* As one closes towards the falls, about a mile away, the Colossal Defenders become apparent.  The figures are carved out of the rock face and extend a good 1,000-1,100’ up the cliff face.
	* The one representing Arden (EX-6) is placed just to the right of the falls, on the east side of the river.  An enormous crouching warrior woman, helmed, with right hand gripping a sword blade down; the left hand is extended outward, palm up; the palm is only about 100’ above the valley floor.  She is slick with moisture and slime from the endless spray.
	* The other representing Vul (EX-7) stands another 400 yards further to the east.  Slender, cowled, arms folded across its chest, with a stone staff in the crook of the left arm. It always appears to be looking at those who glance at it.
*  The cliff face is uneven rock, with bits of shrubbery and small trees growing out of it; it is home to goats and worse.
	* Close inspection may reveal (Spot vs 6) areas that appear to be worked by human hands (e.g., EX-9, EX-14).
	* The Colossus of Arden the Defender (EX-6) is also slick with moisture and slime, as is the Tower of Madness (EX-4) and the lower portions of the Long Stair (EX-8).

	* Plunge pool at the foot of the falls is ~275’ across, ~50’ deep.
	* Death to swim in the pool.  Force of the falls produces a constant, powerful swirling motion, drawing  water down to the foot of the basin before spitting it up along the sides.
* Mist blasts out from the base.  Roaring drowns out hearing.

### EX-4: Tower of Madness

* Built only 250 years ago, already in extremely poor repair.

* Weird Effects (d8)
	* 1) Whispers at the back of consciousness: ‘Where is she? Come back Nyema!’
	* 2) Vague sense of uneasiness, as if a malign presence is watching

	* 4) A sense of intense fear washes over, causing them to wish to leave immediately
