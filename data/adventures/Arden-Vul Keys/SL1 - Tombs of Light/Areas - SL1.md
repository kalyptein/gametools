## Overview

This small sub-level differs in architecture and purpose from much of the rest of the level. It was developed in antiquity by the niravairi (see new monsters), rivals to the rudishva and noted planar explorers. They located a permanent portal in the Astral plane that led to a site here, within Arden Vul (SL1-11). Discovering strange crystals and new life forms (lumens - see new monsters), they built a small research facility to study the optical phenomena (and added a few other portals as well). When the Beacon crashed here, the rudishva discovered signs of their rivals’ activity and, for a while, occupied the site in the hope that it could aid in their propulsion dilemma. Eventually the dangers posed by the lumens, as well as the drain on resources, caused the rudishva leadership to pull back (although one scientist refused to leave - see SL1-8). Centuries later, while improving a light well so as to transform it into the Well of Light (2-1), the Archonteans discovered the nearby complex; they hopefully installed a secret door in the Well and hoped that the area would yield secrets, but after several disasters (see SL1-6), they abandoned further exploration (thus giving the sub-level its current name). The sub-level is comprised of a hexagonal upper chamber designed for the study of lumens and optics, and a lower level for storage chambers and the niravairi portals. 

Successful navigation of the sub-level requires solving difficult puzzles with regard to light beams, as well as confrontation with the lumens (and more).


* No encounters on Sub-Level 1

Revamped Explanation
* Rather than a separate species (the Niravairi), this area was made by the Rudishva to study a planar weak point (perhaps the result of the arcanum deposits) and its possibilities for transport or fuel.  The lumens were summoned, and eventually proved too dangerous and the experiment was shuttered.
* Elves discovered the old Rudishva memory crystal cache in the Fenns (where Gerrilad was driven mad by a flawed crystal).
	* The others retained sanity, but their personalities shifted to incorporate the crystal's data (more idealized expression of collective rudishvan identity than particular people; they may blend more smoothly if given time)
* Knowing their elven bodies are now immune to the plague, they have come here to rediscover lost technology and reenable starflight to escape this world.
	* They have integrated cybernetics into themselves, their druidic magic permanently disrupted by the crystals fused to them.
	* They don't know about the fuel breakthrough, and so have came here to investigate the lumen experiments.
	* They discovered that Horus's divine essence might be accessible from the astral, a potentially remarkable source of power, and so launched an expedition through the caskets and portal in SL1-11 to try to reach it.
	* Not particularly well disposed to either "local primitives" (humans, elves, etc) or "degenerate remnants" (the various surviving rudishva), but would potentially work with them to advance their goals.

General Construction Notes
* Niravairi areas: SL1-2 to SL1-13. Corridors are hexagonal in shape. All niravairi areas are sheathed in impact resistant, opaque, hexagonal tiles made of colored plasglass. Unless otherwise noted, ceilings are 12’ tall.
* Archontean areas: SL1-1.

## Areas

#### SL1-1: Secret Door and Archontean Entrance Corridor

* The Well of Light is a 200’-long shaft, 5’ in diameter, descending from the surface (AV-14) to 2-1.
	* The well shaft is studded with convex mirrors and reflective stones so that sunlight is reflected down its length.
* A secret door is located on the south wall of the well shaft 110’ below the surface.
	* Twisting one of the dozens of convex mirrors near the door 90 degrees causes a 5’-tall panel of the well shaft to spring inward.
	* Beyond is a 10’-long, roughly hewn rock corridor that opens into a darkened, hemispherical chamber (SL1-2).
	* The short corridor was dug by the Archonteans who were constructing the Well of Light when they detected worked areas to the south.

#### SL1-2: Niravairi Entrance Chamber

* A hemispherical chamber, with a 10’ ceiling curving down on all sides.
	* All surfaces - floor and ‘ceiling/walls’ - are covered with opaque, impact-resistant, reflective, white hexagonal plasglass tiles, cleverly molded to fit the contours of the chamber.
	* The chamber is dark, but any light source in the chamber immediately reflects across the surface, shedding light everywhere.
	* A narrow passageway to the east bends south and ends in a heap of collapsed rock, masonry, and plasglass shortly after some stairs begin to rise.
		* The stair once connected SL1-2 with SL1-8.  The rudishva leaders collapsed it to prevent further dangerous experimentation with the tombs of light by their scientists.

#### SL1-3: Corridor with Niravairi Light Tiles

* The walls, floor and ceiling of this 60’-long tunnel leading from SL1-2 to SL1-4 is made from opaque, impact-resistant plasglass fitted seamlessly together.
	* Entering causes an illusion (hologram) to appears half-way down the tunnel.
		* A female rudishva in orange skinsuit and skullcap appears and speaks slowly and clearly (Rudishva): “I regret to inform you that this area is off-limits to all personnel, by order of Captain Leil-Jor.  After the recent accident, further experimentation has been deemed too hazardous to continue.  Science officers should report for reallocation to other projects.
			* The renegade responsible for the dangerous experiments found within has been ‘reallocated’.”
		* This repeats every 5 minutes for as long as the entrance tunnel is touched.
	* Each 10' section of the tunnel is a different hue (north to south): yellow-green- blue-purple-red-orange.  Any light from the Well reveals multi-colored rainbow of flashing colors. 
		* Touching a tile of a particular color causes the entire entrance corridor to glow that color.  Each color has an addition effect:
			* Yellow: toggles the yellow light beam from SL1-5
			* Blue: toggles the blue light beam from SL1-6
			* Red: toggles the red light beam from SL1-7
			* Green: toggles both yellow and blue beams from SL1-5 and SL1-6
			* Purple: toggles both red and blue beams (from SL1-6 and SL1-7)
			* Orange: toggles both red and yellow beams (from SL1-5 and SL1-7)
	* The door at the south end is a circular disk of opaque plasglass hinged to open into area SL1-4.
		* Note: keep careful note of which light beams are active.  If a group activated every color in the corridor in order, they would enter area SL1-4 with all three light beams activated.

#### SL1-4: Upper Tomb of Light

* This hexagonal chamber is 40’ tall, formed of un-tinted plasglass tiles.
	* The walls and ceiling are opaque, but the floor is clear and translucent.
	* (G) At the center is a 10’-wide hexagonal crystal pillar stretching from floor to ceiling, emitting a low white glow.
		* 3 Lumens cause the white glow of the pillar, emerging to attack in 1d4+2 rounds.
			* Slain lumens drop 6" octagonal crystals (50 gp) which can be used to access SL1-9.
			* Unless the energy blobs in SL1-5, SL1-6 and SL1-7 are permanently destroyed, a lumen is summoned each hour to replace any that are ‘slain.’
		* Barely visible through the floor is a second chamber (SL1-9), into which the hexagonal pillar seems to descend.
		* The pillar has AC -2 and 50 hp.  When beams are active, it heats up and those coming within 5' take 1d6 damage.
		* On each side of the pillar not facing a light beam, 5’ from the floor of SL1-4, is a 6" octagonal indentation.
			* Placing a lumen's crystal remains in each of the three indentations (or Vesh-Lok's octagonal ruby key (SL1-11) in just one) causes the pillar to sink slowly (over 1 Turn) through the floor (coming to rest 30' down, still 10' above the floor of SL1-9).  It rises back in 1d3+2 Turns.
	* 5’-diameter tunnels are set 25’ up the sides of three of the six chamber walls.
		* These tunnels rise at 35’-degree angles to areas SL1-5, SL1-6, and SL1-7.
	* On the same side of the room as the entrance tunnel is an archway to SL1-8, blocked by an impenetrable buzzing energy screen.  It can only be deactivated from SL1-8.
	* Six corpses lie near the entrance, some scorched, others appear roasted, and one desiccated.
		* Imperial field plate +1, leather armor +2; short sword +3; broadsword +1; mace of dispelling; a charred leather pouch with 20 pearls (100 gp each); a piece of white plasteel on which is etched (with a laser) a fairly accurate image of the door leading from 5-46 to 5-52, with a subsequent piece of graffiti in the form of an arrow pointing to the correct icon that allows safe entrance to 5-52 (see 5-46 for this door).
			* "Declining sequence to open, avoid mis-entering at all costs."
* Light Beams
	* Depending on the actions of visitors in SL1-3, 5' wide beams of red, yellow and/or blue light may be shining into the chamber through the elevated tunnels
		* Carbon-based life that touches a beam takes 4d6 damage per round.
		* Beams scatter off the pillar and fill a zone (a-f) with colored light.
			* The illumination is harmless, but if a lumen is illuminated for a full round, it gains additional abilities dependent on the color.
				* This lasts 4 rounds, or until it attunes to a different colored zone.
				* The lumens understand and exploit the effects of the beams.
			* Beams illuminate the zone they enter through in their color, as well as the adjacent zones.  Two beams illuminating the same zone produce a mixed color.  A beam-entry zone with inactive beam is dark.
		* They scatter off the pillar and flooding certain zones of the chamber.
	* If the pillar is lowered, where it would be, active beams collide in a 10' radius cloud of roiling energy that engulfs the hole to SL1-9 and deals 2d6 damage on contact.
	* Darkness cast at 10th level or higher can neutralize a beam and/or its illuminated zone, and only for 1d4 rounds.
* Illumination Effects on Lumens
	* Dark: none
	* Yellow: regenerate 2d8 damage per turn
	* Green: regenerate 1d8 damage per turn and immune to electricity
	* Blue: +1d4 desiccation damage to attacks and all liquids save at -1 or evaporate
	* Violet: the lumen immediately shifts to infra-red or ultraviolet (50% chance of which)
	* Red: +1d4 fire damage to attacks and may ignite combustibles
	* Orange: +1d12 explosive damage to attacks w/ 20' radius

3 lumens: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 180’ flying (Class A); HD 9; HP 43, 39, 37; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4, or 2-8, or 3-12, or 4-16; MR 25%. 
* Special attacks: blindness (2/turn, blind 3 rnds).
	* shift between IR, visible, and UV (1/3rd chance each)
* Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to light and optical effects (illusions, blindness, etc).  +2 damage per die from electricity
* Slain lumens drop 6" octagonal crystals (50 gp) which can be used to access SL1-8.

#### SL1-5: Yellow Chamber

* A spherical chamber is completely sheathed in canary yellow plasglass.
* Floating and rotating in the center of the chamber is a blob of yellow energy roughly 10’ in diameter. 
	* If activated by the tiles in SL1-3, the floating sphere emits a continuous beam of yellow light that travels down a 5’-diameter shaft to SL1-4.
	* Touching the beam deals 4-24 HP damage per round.  While it's activie, it is difficult to move down the shaft without touching.
	* Destroying the blob of energy disables the light beam mechanism and prevents the arrival of new lumens to replace any that have been slain.
		* This requires 6th+ level destructive magic or physical attacks with +2 or higher weapons (AC 4, 50 hp, save vs spells or take 4d6 energy damage upon striking).  Other magic that opposes the properties of the yellow energy might also work. 
* Illusory Wall (east): 1-in-4 to find, leading to a narrow walkway to SL1-8.

#### SL1-6: Blue Chamber

* Identical to SL1-5, but with blue walls, blue energy blob, and a blue light beam the blob produces.
* Unlike the other two spherical chambers, there is no secret door here.

#### SL1-7: Red Chamber

* Identical to SL1-5, but with red walls, red energy blob, and a red light beam the blob produces.
* Illusory Wall (east): 1-in-4 to find, leading to a narrow walkway to SL1-8.

#### SL1-8: Laboratory

* A long, narrow chamber covered with white, hexagonal, opaque, impact-resistant, reflective, plasglass tiles.
	* A narrow corridor and stairs once led to SL1-2 but is now a pile of slag and collapsed rock, and so the chamber is accessible only through the secret doors from SL1-5 and SL1-7. 
	* A steep, staircase leads down 20’ to SL1-4.
		* The end (at SL1-4) is blocked by a force wall placed by Liut-Repp, easily passed through from the north (SL-8), but not the south (SL-4).
			* An on/off button is in the wall next to the doorway.
	* A red plastic console sits against the south wall.
		* Above the console are three hexagonal plasglass view screens, each starred and broken (as if hit by a hammer).
	* Four man-sized lumps of melted plastic, wiring, and electronics are the remains of some destroyed advanced technological equipment.
	* Against the north wall are 2 decrepit wooden workbenches and 3 small casks. 
		* On the workbenches are verious tools of a strange metal alloy (hammer, screwdrivers, wrenches, awls, a dead electric drill, a dead soldering iron, etc.). 
		* The casks contain desiccated food remnants and a crust of dried-up liquid. 
	* A hammock of unusual material (nylon) hangs near the benches, quite sturdy.  In it rests the desiccated body of Liut-Repp, a rudishva scientist, dressed in her orange skinsuit (with name on the breast).
		* She appears to have died peacefully. In her pocket are sky blue and platinum rudishva identity plaques.
	* Beside the hammock and benches is a troll chest.
		* Locked and keyed to Liut-Repp’s hand (her corpse's hand works).
		* 10 2-lb bars of platinum (500 gp each), a 6" octagonal crystal, and a rudishva grav disk with 2 lesser power supplies (10 and 14 charges).
		* Hand-made notes (Glyphik)
			* A planar nexus has been created here by the concentration of arcanum.
			* The nexus or the arcanum concentration in the warp was studied for its potential utility for propulsion/escape.
			* The beam array built to probe the nexus and open portals has had a side-effect of attracting hostile photonic entities (lumens).
			* The "warp prospectors" retrieved and domesticated some energy entities (mihstu) during their explorations.  They are linked to the pods as trained to guard and guide their occupants.
			* The massive arcanum deposit (dead Horus) in the warp distorts space and time around it, dangerous to approach (trapped Sigeric and co).  All prospector efforts to approach safely have failed.
			* After the lumens killed a researcher, captain Leil-Jor order the experiment shut down.  Liut-Repp protests bitterly, tries to resist and gets slapped down.  She insists she will remain here, determined to unlock the potential of the nexus and arcanum.
	* A 10”x10” square of silvery metal is attached to the western end of the north wall.
		* It had a rune engraved on it, which has been brutally scratched out.
		* A subtle 5’-diameter circle on the floor marks where the plasglass tiles have been marred by adhesive. These are signs where a rudishva teleport node was removed, which once connected to the rudishva areas on Level 5.

* GM Note: Liut-Repp was a rudishva science officer interested in optics. When the area was discovered, she successfully lobbied for resources to study it. She became convinced that studying the lumens and their optical properties might provide an alternate form of propulsion to enable the rudishva to escape Magae.
* After an assistant was atomized by the light rays in SL1-4, Captain Leil-Jor ordered the experiment shut down. The captain had the control panels and equipment here destroyed, and the access corridor from SL1-2 destroyed with explosives. Liut-Repp refused to leave, however, and ended her days studying the lumens.

#### SL1-9: Lower Tomb of Light

* The Lower Tomb is only accessible via the hole created when the hexagonal pillar in SL1-4 is lowered.
	* The pillar stands 10' above the floor of this room when fully lowered (which takes 1 Turn).  It rises back up after 1d3+2 Turns.
	* A second set of octagonal holes exists 5' above ground in the base of the pillar, allowing it to be lowered while raised if lumen crystals or Vesh-Lok's ruby key (SL1-11) are placed in it.
* The lower tomb is 40’ tall, with walls and floor coated in opaque, octagonal, rainbow-hued plasglass tiles which sparkle when illuminated.
	* Lumens can phase through the translucent ceiling between SL1-4 and SL1-9, attacking people down here.
	* Four stone corridors lead from the central chamber.
	* Four large hexagonal prisms (12' wide and 18' high) made of shimmering walls of colored light stand along the walls between corridors.
		* These are containment units employed by the Order of Planar Explorers to store specimens discovered during their ventures.  A member of the Order will understand how to operate them.
		* Holographic symbols (Glyphik) label the occupants and denote hazard warnings.
		* The prisms are made of sheets of light--translucent, slightly shimmering, and impenetrable--projected from six octagonal crystals set in the floor around the prism, destroying any of which disables the prism (AC 4, 20 hp).
		* Entities within a prism are visible, and exist in suspended animation; it takes 1-3 Turns to recover enough to converse coherently.  Actions prior to recovery are at -2 (including attack and defense).
* Prisms
	* Prism 1) a derghodaemon
	* Prism 2) A space squid
	* Prism 3) a specimen of the ichor of Rimmaq-Isfet, appearing as a large blob of oily black matter
	* Prism 4: A transposer, wearing the form of a rudishva
* If released, the derghodaemon, space squid, and ichor of Rimmaq-Isfet attack immediately; the transposer negotiates in Mithric, hoping to attack from surprise once suspicions are lulled. 

Derghodaemon: SZ L; AL NE; AC 0; MV 120’; HD 11+ 22; HP 95; #AT 5; Dmg 1-4+8(x5); MR 80% to 1st-level spells. Continual abilities: infravision; ultravision. Special attacks: grab attack; cause fear; sleep 2/day. Special defenses: half damage from acid, cold, fire; immune to poison, paralysis; silver, or +1 or better weapons to hit. Special: create darkness 10’ radius; teleport without error; detect invisible; read magic; comprehend languages; invisibility; telepathy; word of recall (1/day).

Space squid: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 20’, 120’ flying (Class D); HD 16; HP 109; #AT 7; Dmg 1-8(x6)/6-36; MR 35%. Special attacks: stunning attack; consumption of prey (4-24 HP damage). Special defenses: immune to cold and fire.

Ichor of Rimmaq-Isfet, appearing as a large blob of oily black matter: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 12; HP 83; #AT 2; Dmg 1-6/1-6; MR 30%. Special attacks: caustic touch (1-4 HP acid damage); crush (1-10 HP/rd); obliterate organic matter. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold and acid.

Transposer, wearing the form of a rudishva: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 150’; HD 6; HP 39; #AT 2; Dmg 1-6/1-6. Special attacks: transposes damage. Special defenses: change self/illusion.
* Transposition: on a hit, target saves vs spells or becomes linked (can have up to 4 links at a time).  If transposer is injured, it takes half and each linked takes the same.  If linked is healed, healed for half and transposer gains the other half.  Remove curse or dispel magic breaks link; dispel on transposer breaks a random link).  Otherwise, links last until death or dismissal.  Transposer always knows exact location of linked in the same plane.

#### SL1-10: Portal to Ethereal Plane

white / silver / mist portal to elemental air

* At the point of this arrow-shaped chamber a 5’-diameter portal of purple energy hovers in the air.
	* The unsealed portal has no depth on this plane and is set at a 45-degree angle. It leads to the Ethereal Plane.
	* A 4’-tall glyph (Rudishva, "Ethereal") is incised into the east wall and filled with platinum.  Next to it has been hurriedly scribed in some red substance a set of smaller glyphs (Rudishva, “Vaporous Curtain to the Deep at 30-degrees from Turquoise Veil.”)

#### SL1-11: Portal to Astral Plane

yellow / golden portal to astral

* At the point of this arrow-shaped chamber a 5’-diameter portal of yellow energy hovers in the air.
	* The unsealed portal has no depth on this plane and is set at a 45-degree angle. It leads to the Astral Plane.
	* The rest of the chamber contains six movable caskets of smoky, opaque plasglass. 
		* Silvery cords emerge from four of the caskets (those with living occupants) and lead into the portal.
			* 5% chance that some/all of the explorers finally free themselves and return 1d6 Turns after the PCs enter the area.
		* The caskets are 3’ wide by x 4’ tall by 7’ long.
		* On the side of each are three large glyphs (Rudishva): “Order/Group”, “Planes”, “Traveler/Visitor.”
		* The lid is incised with an image and a string of 8 to 15 smaller glyphs (occupant's name) composed of tesserae of colored plasglass.
		* On the short end is a silver disk about 2’ in diameter.
		* In the center of the lid is an 1" octagonal depression.
			* Inserting a signet ring into the depression opens the casket without incident.
			* Otherwise, the caskets are very difficult to force (bend bars) or break (AC 4, 50 hp).  Attempting summons a mihstu to defend the inhabitant. 
				* Mihstu are tamed / re-engineered lumens.
			* Opening the casket of a living member pulls their soul back from the Astral.  It takes 1-2 Turns to recover enough for speech or action.
	* A crumbling, decrepit wooden chest sits in the corner.
		* Inside are 20 20-lb platinum ingots (5,000 gp each).
			* Misc treasure (20,000 gp)
		* Various desiccated / rotted bits of adventuring gear, decades old.

Caskets
* Casket 1 (“Riss-Adar", dead and desiccated, silver cord severed)
	* Rhys
	* Niravairi astral dripping sword, octagonal signet ring, 3 lb of gold flakes (3,000 gp).
* Casket 2 ("Jall-Bak", living)

	* Athelwyn
	* Octagonal signet ring, the golden band of Singalok Ket
	* A brass cylinder etched with glyph directions to Horus’s God-Isle in the Astral Plane.
		* To use the cylinder, enter the Astral and concentrate on an image of the solar disk; a golden hawk appears; by following it, one arrives at the God-Isle.  As a failsafe, the brass cylinder is also a beacon, emitting a faint glow that increases in intensity as the holder nears the other members of Vesh-Lok’s team. 
* Casket 4 ("Team Commander Vesh-Lok", living)
	* Sigeric Lok
	* Niravairi astral tulwar, a pouch filled with 50 red spinels (200 gp each), a large glowing octagonal ruby (activates the hexagaonal pillar in SL1-9).
	* A crystal tablet, with  glyphs (Glyphik)
		* “Veshlok and his tuman depart for the Astral gray to seek the arm of the Hawk-God. Await him here. He shall return with the artifact of light sought by the Order. Galok-Ket carries the directions to the God-Isle, whose properties Mana-Nik has laid bare.”
* Casket 5 ("Balil-Dor", living)
	* Valdamerca
	* Niravairi astral crossbow of accuracy w/ 20 bolts +2; jade cup of life restoration.
* Casket 6 ("Pan-Anik", living)
	* Eadmer

	* A set of crystal tablets filled with glyphs.
		* Notes describing the discovery of the corpse of dead Horus floating in the Astral Plane, and of the valuable arcanum to be mined from that corpse, as well as artifacts said to be stored in his belt pouch.

* Backstory
	* The crystal-jacked elves discovered this laboratory and the dead researcher's theories about using arcanum and optical-planar properties for propulsion.  They were aware of the legend of Horus's death and were able to triangulate where they believed the god-corpse could be found in the astral.  Using the projection caskets, a group led by Vesh-Lok launched an expedition to obtain some of the vast arcanum deposits that must exist within Horus's veins.
	* The team was ambushed and trapped inside Horus’s body by perils. As time works differently in the Astral, their many years of Prime Material captivity has only lasted a few years for them in the Astral.  During this ordeal, two members were slain. The other four are still alive and trapped in the Astral Plane.
	* A returned explorer immediately tries to open the other caskets with his signet ring.
	* 
	* Vesh-Lok and team might welcome aid retrying their expedition, although they now recognize how dangerous it is and won't try again immediately.
		* They are cagey about exactly who they area, what they know, and what their goal is.
		* They will offer to "reawaken" any elves in the party with crystals and invite them to join their endeavor, but won't insist.
		* They might take up position in Gosterwick as an adventuring party, or they may retreat to the Fenns for now.
	* Should intruders slaughter the explorers, there may be more of the crystal-jacked elves out there, who could prove implacable and dangerous enemies thereafter.  They would seek to recover the special astral items held by Vesh-lok’s team.
	* 
	* 
	* There was no "Horus corpse" plot thread.  The elves were trying to access Rudish via the astral plane to call for help.  This was an early idea of the rudishvan scientists that was explored at the Tombs of Light, but abandoned.  The elves attempted it again, without success.

* The octagonal sigil ring is made from lumen crystal

Hybridization
* most of the available medpods were moved to the Fenn's facility
* using human genetic material, arcanum, and Psalor-Ki's blood techno-sorcery, rudishva were able to link their souls the life force of this planet, transforming into quasi-humans, gaining primal magic, but forced to eschew tech
	* rudishvan genetically engineered receptivity to cybernetic implants, the channels in their bodies, where repurposed by Psalor-Ki to receive the primal energies, but it required eschewing implants and tech, which disrupted the link to the energies and would have allowed the disease to keep progressing.
	* the energies would protect the hybrid from the ravages of the heqeti plague, which was targeted to the xeno-biology of the rudishva who lacked any arcane "immune system", once the heqeti had the necessary lore to target them (via the kaliyani betrayal).  Local life such as humans did have such things, and were not so universally vulnerable.
* the rudishva, knowing they were abandoning their tech and old lives, made many data memory recordings.
	* the explorer elves found this and tried to access these "ancestral memories", accepting the implants.  They are now overwhelmed by a blended "racial" memory of the rudishva.
* elves are not vulnerable to the heqeti plague anymore, being well and thoroughly mixed with humanity and acquiring native immunity; so the cyberelves aren't at risk.
	* they see themselves as having reclaimed the "true" heritage of their people, and will seek to further it.  many elves will likely regard this is as perversion.

#### SL1-12: Sealed Portal to the Abyss

black-purple portal, triple sealed, to abyss

* At the point of this arrow-shaped chamber a 5’-diameter portal of purple energy hovers in the air.  It is sheathed in a shiny, clear coating.
	* The portal has no depth on this plane and is set at a 45-degree angle. It leads to the Abyss.
	* A 2’-diameter silver disk floats next to the portal, with a 1" octagonal depression in the center.
		* Inserting a planar explorer signet ring (see SL1-11) causes the clear seal on the portal to be dematerialize.  This lasts as long as the ring is in place and plus an extra 5 minutes after removal. The seal cannot be removed from the far side of the portal.
		* If the seal is opened, there is a 33% chance that a babau demon enters immediately to sow chaos.

GM Note: a dimensional flaw exists to be made into a portal due to the long heqeti presence.  It leads to the layer of the Abyss ruled by Tsathoggua.
