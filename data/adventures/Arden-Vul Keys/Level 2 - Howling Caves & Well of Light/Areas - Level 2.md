## Overview


This level was the private level of the priests of Thoth, noted for its mysterious Whispering Hall (2-63), the dread Hall of Judgment (2-35), the famed Library of Thoth (2-72), and the Howling Caves (2-56), where the baboon servitors of Thoth lived and bred.

A central theme to this level is light and dark; the baboons are more aggressive in the dark, and may be partly deterred by light.
* Major factions include a horde of baboons that roam throughout the level in packs, led by some intelligent baboons and the druid Gerrilad the Grey (2-69).  If PCs are not quiet and careful, they may find themselves hunted through the darkened halls, hearing only by clattering claws, occasional hoots, and distant howling until the baboons attack.
* If they can figure out how to repair the great mirror (2-1), the PCs might be able to turn the tables, thereby turning the hunters into the hunted. 

When the PCs enter the level, it will be dark. Since the Well of Light (2-1) served originally to illuminate the entire level through the placement of mirrors at specially placed intersections (mirrors are marked M on the map), it is possible to change that status by repairing the mirror at 2-1 and experimenting with the lesser mirrors throughout the area.

* If the PCs manage to ‘turn on the lights’, the baboons will be disheartened (lower morale by 25%, and -2 to hit).

The placement of certain monsters depends on whether or not Gerrilad the Grey (2-69) is conducting a punishment ritual in area 2-35 (75% likely). The GM must determine whether or not such a ritual is under way as soon as the PCs enter the level. If Gerrilad is meting out punishment, he will be in 2-35, along with Sisko (2-29) and Trefko (2-32). If a ritual is not taking place, the GM needs to roll dice to determine the location of each of these figures. 
* For Trefko, he is in his lair (2-32) 80% of the time, while he is with Sisko in 2-28 the rest of the time. 
* For Sisko, there is an 80% chance he is holding court (2-28) and a 20% chance he is in his lair (2-29).
* Gerrilad the Grey is found in the library (2-70) 38% of the time, resting in his room (2-70) 60% of the time, and traveling the tunnels of Sub-Level 15 2% of the time.

## Level 2: 1 - 15

### 2-1: The Well of Light (aka AV-14, w/ access to SL-1)

* The Well is a 200’-long shaft, 5’ in diameter, which descends from the surface (AV-14) to emerge in this chamber.
	* The shaft is studded with convex mirrors and reflective stones in a carefully orchestrated manner.  When it is daylight (and clear) on the surface, bright sunlight will be reflected down the long well to this chamber.
			* 110’ down the shaft is an extremely well hidden secret door (1-in-8 to spot) leading to the Tombs of Light (SL1-1 includes more info on the secret door).
				* To open, twisting one of the dozens of convex mirrors near the door 90-degrees, causing a 5’-tall panel of the well shaft to spring inward, revealing a 5’-tall, hexagonally-shaped passage to the south.
			* The well does not contain ladder rungs or any other device for negotiating it.
				* Climbing down is optically challenging due to the brightness of the interior.
* The 25' high chamber at the bottom is tiled in pale yellow squares from floor to ceiling.
	* A brilliant shaft of light descends from the ceiling to the floor on sunlit days;  illuminating a 5’-diameter circle in the center of the room. The rest of the room is dark.
		* A 5' diameter depression lies in the ground at the foot of the shaft of the light.  It is fully 5' deep, but 3' of muck and wiry baboon hair fills it.
			* If cleared, a large convex mirror set in the bottom is revealed, which will flood 2-1 with diffuse light from the beam of sunlight (Bright Light).
			* On three sides of the mirror are 2” holes in the floor suitable for inserting some sort of rod or object.
	* Cast into the corners are pieces of a steel tripod with a 5’-radius central aperture (designed to house another mirror, found in 2-70).
		* The mirror could be tilted to direct a beam of light towards any of the intersections marked 2-6.
	* Wall sconces also line the walls.  If the beam is in use, this room can be lit by torchlight.
* The baboons favor the dark, and done their best to disable the Well of Light.  All the mirrors are enchanted to be exceptionally durable (thus the baboons have been unable to break them).
	* If the PCs manage to ‘turn on the lights’, the baboons will be disheartened (lower morale by 25%, and -2 to hit).
* There is a 75% chance that the sound of screaming is heard from the north corridor, indicating Gerrilad is holding a punishment ceremony in 2-35.

### 2-2: Invocation of Light

* One of four identically-shaped chambers (2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5), each housing a portion of the Litany of Light, a simultaneously allegorical and magical ceremony that celebrated Thoth’s gift of knowledge to his faithful through the metaphor of light (see books for locations of manuscripts of the Litany of Light).
* This first chamber was devoted to invocations of the light of Thoth.
	* Clean and empty of trash.
	* Two simple stone benches run along the room, giving a view of the walls.
		* Southeast wall fresco: rows of robed figures raise their hands towards a yellow globe, from which no rays extend. They are superimposed on a dark background as if floating in a void.
			* Across the top is inscribed (Mithric): “Let the Faithful Acknowledge the Darkness and Invoke the Light of Truth.” 
	* A 5’-diameter circle of yellow marble has been inlaid on the floor in front of the southeast wall.
		* One stepping into the yellow circle and intoning “Let Thoth Illuminate My Ignorance” is bathed in a column of light and imbued with darkvison 60' for 12 hours (works up to 2x day).

### 2-3: Reception of Light

* The second chamber in the Litany of Light celebrated the benefits of Thoth’s revealed wisdom.
	* Same benches and yellow marble circle (2-2) before the southwest image.
	* Figures like in 2-2 face the viewer, basking with smiling faces in rays of yellow light from the orb, now the eye of an enormous ibis. The background is bright yellow, and includes tiny inscriptions in the secret tongue of the priesthood of Thoth and images in various hands (secrets revealed to priests of Thoth and recorded on this wall; mostly unintelligible (DM might offer a secret or two of Arden Vul)
		* Above is the inscription (Mithric): “The Light of Truth is Received by the Faithful.” 
	* One stepping into the yellow circle and intoning “Thoth’s light reveals all secrets” is bathed in a column of lightand imbued with +1d4 Wisdom for 1d3 hours (works twice per day, but doesn't stack with itself).

### 2-4: Glorification of Light

* The third chamber in the Litany of Light existed to allow the faithful to glorify the wisdom they had received.
	* Same benches and yellow marble circle (2-2) before the northwest image.
	* Robed figures genuflecting towards an enormous ibis (fully revealed, not just its head as in 2-3). Some bow, others are prostrate, but all display reverence towards the rays that the ibis emits. The background is silver
		* Above is the inscription (Mithric): “Let the Faithful Render Honor and Glory to the Light Which Reveals All.”
	* One stepping into the yellow circle and intoning “All Glory to the Light of Knowledge” followed by a secret known only to them is bathed in a column of light and imbued with True Seeing for 1d3 hours (works twice per day).

### 2-5: Concealing of Light

* The final chamber in the Litany of Light reminded the faithful that sometimes it was necessary to conceal knowledge.
	* Same benches and yellow marble circle (2-2) before the northeast image.
	* Completely black save for a yellow orb from which no rays emerge.
		* Above is the inscription (Mithric): “The Light Must Be Guarded Against the Impious.” 
	* One stepping into the yellow circle and intoning “Thoth’s truths are for Thoth’s Children” is bathed in a column of light and made invisible (as the spell) for up to 2d4 hours (works twice per day).

### 2-6 (x4): Mirrors

* At these four intersections, a silver mirror is attached to the ceiling by a metal swivel joint. 
	* The mirrors can be pointed up either corridor to reflect light from 2-1 down the hallways.
		* If all 4 are tilted at the same angle, they will light the corridors surrounding 2-1.
	* The mirrors are enchanted to be exceptionally durable (thus the baboons haven't been unable to break them).

### 2-7: Vestibule, and Corpses

* This richly decorated chamber was originally a vestibule and robing room for priests engaged in the ritual of Venerable Age (at 2-8 and 3-11).
	* It is brightly lit with a continual light spell cast on the ceiling.
	* A living mosaic (see magic items) covers a 15’x10’ section of the floor.
		* Two adventurer corpses lie face down on the mosaic; chests, abdomens, and faces badly torn by baboon claws.
			* (archontean with scars) Leather armor, light crossbow (no bolts), a pouch (22 sp, 5 gp)
			* (burly, bearded thorcin with tats) Splint mail; a sundered shield; battle axe; backpack (212 cp, 34 sp, a potion of clarity).
	* The walls are covered in pale yellow tiles.  The ceiling was painted yellow to match, but mostly the plaster hangs in shards.
		* On the west wall  is scrawled in blood (Archontean): “They are deterred by light. Restore the well!” (GM Note: this is a clue that the baboons are deterred by light, and that restoring the Well of Light at 2-1 would greatly reduce danger from the baboons)
	* A series of brass pegs run across the west and east walls at shoulder height.
	* The vestibule is remarkably free from debris.
* The hallway from 2-8 to 2-7 is covered entirely in pale yellow tiles, some scratched and/or broken. 
* The Living Mosaic
	* Depicts the truncated pyramid in 3-11.  Its tesserae rearrange to make a rough but comprehensible image of whomever is standing on the pyramid at 3-11. Should there be no one present, the mosaic will simply depict the pyramid.

### 2-8: Pyramid of Venerable Age, Redux (Cf. area 3-11)

* This chamber lies above the Pyramid of Venerable Age (3-11), and is the destination for the teleportation effect accomplished in 3-11.
* The room is shaped like a huge isosceles triangle. with a 50' ceiling beyond torchlight.
	* It is unlit, although numerous wall sconces await torches. 
	* The chamber is dominated by a massive, 40’-tall triangular pyramid of closely fitted granite with a truncated tip, creating a platform.
		* On all three sides, stairs cut into the granite lead up to a central platform, where the mystery was accomplished.
		* The platform has a triangle of lapis-lazuli at its center.  In 3-11 a steel control rod sticks up from the center, but not here (it is in 2-35).
			* Standing on the lapis triangle and depressing the bar (if it is recovered) is teleported to 3-11.  There are no smoke theatrics at this end.
		* Unlike its counterpart in 3-11, this pyramid conceals no pukel-mander.
	* Frescoes on the walls illustrate Thoth’s conquest of aging and death, with creatures of all sorts - including humans - rising up from the ground and shedding the symbols of age (robes, beards, canes).

### 2-9: Guard Post

* A small, dark chamber, littered with trash.
	* Pegs set into the walls that held equipment and clothing.

### 2-10: Antechamber of the Oracle

* Light and a low buzz and crackle of energy can be heard approaching this chamber.
	* The baboons fear and avoid its unpredictable but still-potent magical force. 
* The 20'-tall antechamber is lit with a continual light spell, and still retains much of its decorative splendor.
	* The entire west wall is covered by a fresco of an ibis.  Its eyes are permanently-active coconut-sized lumps of arcanum, and protrude from the fresco a good bit.
			* Every 2 turns the eyes flash, pink light and buzz of energy fills the chamber, casting a dispel magic spell (9th level) on everything (35% chance potions are destroyed).
			* Each requires a Feat of Strength (stuck door) to remove and Dex vs 4 to avoid shattering / crumbling it (or thief Disarm skill).
	* The north wall has a fresco of a smaller ibis head, whose beak spouts a scroll. The curves and wraps of the scroll occupy most of the wall.
		* This scroll has about 200 phrases written on it (Mithric), never-decoded utterances of the oracle. The DM could bury clue(s) about the dungeon here, but they would be quite abstruse to have stumped the priests of Thoth.
	* On the south wall, three blocks of granite (6' wide x 3' tall x 3' deep) protrude from the wall, carved into open mouths, complete with hints of teeth.
		* Continual darkness and silence 15' fills each mouth, hiding the sight and sound of anything entering.
		* Carved on the floor in front of the mouths (Mithric) “Those who would seek Thoth’s knowledge must possess the wisdom to follow his breath.”
			* The middle mouth leads to a long stone staircase that descends 150’ to the Oracle (3-118 and 3-119).
			* The western mouth teleports to the Great Hall (3-123)
			* The eastern mouth teleport to the fane of the Sanctum (5-83).
	* Arcanum Lumps (2x 1 lb fist-sized lump of arcanum)
		* Removing a lump inflicts a magical ‘burn’ on the remover: a personal dispel magic for 2d4 weeks (no spells work, can't use magical devices, can't cast) and feel infused with incredible energy, practically invincible (purely psychological).

### 2-11: Guard Captain’s Chamber

* A formerly opulent chamber, littered with decay and trash.
	* The walls retain their plaster and imagery.
		* The most noticeable image is that of an immense squatting baboon which stares from the north wall. 
		* The baboon's eyes conceal small spy-holes (used by the Chief Priest to spy on his captain, see 2-30).
	* Piles of rotted wood were once a bed, dresser, and desk.
		* Among the trash is a fine long sword, with a baboon-skin grip (worth 35 gp).
		* In the desk drawer is a battered copy of The Courtship of Julius the Exarch.
	* A human skeleton lies in the center of the room, mouth gaping.
 
### 2-12: Barracks

* Both doors to the barracks are closed and spiked (from the outside) with baboon feces smeared on them.
	* Shut inside is a pack of 6 starving ghouls.
	* Listeners hear groans, whimpers, and wordless pleading.
	* The chamber has been ravaged, plaster shredded, furniture splintered, filth smeared about.

### 2-13: Baboon Attack

* Both doors to this chamber are gone.
* The room is filthy, the frescoes are long gone, and piles of trash, fur, and excrement litter the floor. 
	* Light or noise will provoke attack from the scavenging baboon troop inside.
		* 6 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20, 19, 18, 18, 15, 14; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### 2-14: Dormitory

* Elaborate wooden cells line the walls of this large chamber.
	* Dark and smelling strongly of baboon urine.
	* Four cells are 20’x10’, while the other eight are 10’x10’.
	* All have teakwood walls and doors, intricately carved with floral and animal motifs.

			* Two stories from The Deeds of Phagtro the Westron
		* The teakwood is very fine and in good condition.
			* Disassembled by a skilled carpenter, the whole set (very heavy and bulky) could be sold for 10,000 to a collector in a city.  Less skilled workers roll INT vs 6 to preserve it, or damage leaves only 3d4 pieces worth 1d6 x 100 gp each.
	* A life-sized stone statue in an action pose stands just to the west of the door (Remagis, a petrified human priest of Thoth, stoned during the chaos of the complex's abandonment; system shock roll to survive being turned back to flesh).
		* He speaks only Mithric and will be extremely confused. Still, he possesses a good knowledge of the layout of Levels 1, 2, 3, and parts of 5 and 6.
		* Remagis, 1st-level male Archontean cleric of Thoth: SZ M; AL LN; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 1; HP 6; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (mace). Abilities: STR 11, INT 15, WIS 17, DEX 16, CON 11, CHA 14.

## Level 2: 16 - 30

### 2-16: Crossroads

* Bare stone walls.
	* Inlaid in the floor in colored glass is a set of cardinal compass points.
	* Low pulsating light emanates from the west corridor.
	* An ibis-shaped iron lever is set into the west wall.
		* It operated the portcullis, but is immoveable with rust (and warded by anti-magic, see 2-17).

### 2-17: Anti-Magic Zone

* This entire chamber (including the portcullis at 2-16) has been enchanted with an anti-magic shell (protection against summonings gone awry in 2-19).
	* If the portcullis is forced open, the ghouls in 2-20 to 2-22 can roam Level 2.  Might  soften up the baboons.
	* In the center of the room is a small, carved ivory box, some 18”x12”x4” in size (Coffer of Zox, holding 4 ghouls and 7 skeletons). 
	* Six ravaged corpses lie in a pile across the threshold of the door leading to 2-20.
* Noise or light here attracts the ghouls (2-20).  Fighting may draw Jhentris (2-22) to investigate (25% chance).

Coffer of Zox
* Basphemous leering faces and mouths, tongues extended
* Evil aura, 150' radius, draws corporeal undead to claim it.
* Speak "portal" (Mithric) opens a portal to Negative Energy Plane.
* Speak "entrap" (Mithric), for the next turn, any corporeal undead w/in 20' under 5 HD must save vs transform or be sucked into the box.
	* Holds up to 17 undead (a carved tongue retracts for each one in storage).
	* If an 18th would be absorbed, all stored undead burst out, uncontrolled.
* Speak "unleash" (Mithric), stored undead appear and obey.

### 2-18: Stuck Door

* This door is spiked from the inside (two priests of Thoth tried to fortify themselves against the ghouls in 2-20 and 2-22).
	* Losing hope, the priests raged and destroyed a small fortune in alchemy and summoning equipment.
* The bodies of the priests rest against the wall where they finally committed suicide.
	* 2 orange silk robes with arcane sigils of Thoth embroidered on them (50 gp each).
* The floor is littered with broken glass, and bits of colored flakes.  Three rickety sets of wooden shelving line the walls.  Two ivory wands have been snapped in half.
	*   Among the debris: a ring of spell storing (stores 3 first level spells), a scroll (augury), a pouch of 20 small garnets (5 gp each).

### 2-19: Summoning Chamber

* A locked stone door (key in 2-22) leads to this enormous summoning chamber.
	* If the 2 imps within hear the PCs entering / approaching, they will be in goat and rat form. If surprised, they will be in their natural form.
	* Listening at the door before it is opened will likely (50%) allow one to hear bleating and chittering sounds (a pair of imps in goat and rat form).
* The walls are plastered and painted inky black, while the 30’ ceiling is painted sky blue.
	* A continual light spell shines from a point at the center of the ceiling.

		* Carved ivory coffer (about 18”x12”x4”; carved with obscene images of mating demons, 200 gp).
			* Cursed: the first to touch it takes 2d6 damage and suffers rapid hair growth until the curse is removed (in one hour the hair will reach shoulder length; in one day it will be floor-length).  The coffer then loses its magical.
			* Rattling about within are 2 Acorns of Fenth.
* Inset in the floor of the northwest corner is a Thothian teleporation ring (address: WH-YE-BL-GR-RE-BK)
	* A full set of glass activation squares for this address are in place.  Anyone stepping into the ring will shimmer briefly and then reappear in the same spot.

### 2-20: Ghouls

* This former preparation chamber looks like a madhouse.
	* Badly mutilated and defaced frescoes once depicted serene images of Thoth and his priests.  Most of the equipment has been destroyed.
	* Bits of insane ramblings scrawled on the walls (Mithric) indicating cannibalism, fear of "Jhentris", and furious murder.
	* Searching among the trash for a Turn: a pair of bolts of fire, a jade bracelet (25 gp), and a rough diamond (1,000 gp).
* A dozen priests and apprentices were conducting a dangerous summoning ritual in 2-19 in the last days before the complex was to be abandoned.
	* When the ritual failed, the guards (2-16) feared to release unspecified evil and wouldn't open the portcullis. Eventually all died of starvation and self-inflicted wounds, then rose as 8 ghouls due to the corrupted ritual.
	* Noise of combat is likely (50%) to attract the skeletons (2-21).

8 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 14, 13, 12, 11, 11, 9; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

6 skeletons: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1; HP 8, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special defenses: immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold; cutting and piercing weapons do half damage.

### 2-22: Jhentris the Ghoul

* A former alchemical laboratory, now the ‘court’ of Jhentris, an ambitious priest returned  as an unusually powerful ghoul.
	* Jhentris sits atop a strange throne made of bone and wooden table scrapes resting atop a desk placed on top of a table.

### 2-23: Magical Laboratory (w/ Access to AV-18)

* Locked door leads.  Gerrilad holds this key.
* This former wizard’s laboratory holds 8 tables of different size and heights, on, under, and near which isa huge assortment of items.
	* A huge (10’-tall) carved baboon face with extended tongue stares from the south wall.
		* The features are exaggerated, with hollowed-out eyes and nostril cavities that extend over the tongue. Currently an empty flask rests on the tongue.
		* Potion machine: if an empty flask is placed on the tongue, and appropriate samples are laid in the eyes; after 3-12 rounds, the appropriate potion will drip out of the nostrils and into the flask.
	* An 8’-tall stone statue of a human clad in kilt and Thothian head-dress, carrying a spear stands to the west of the entrance hall.

### 2-27: Haunted Room

* The door to this room is intact, and pulled shut.
* The walls are brightly painted with pastoral scenes of hunting with birds and dogs in marsh and forest; in every scene is a large ibis, which accompanies the hunter.
	* Just inside the doorway are piled 10 skeletal baboon corpses. 
	* On the other side of the baboon pile is the mostly-skeletonized form of a large human, still dressed in a chain byrnie and wielding an enormous axe.
		* The Axe of the Wastes 
	* Against the east wall is a simple rope bed, whose bedclothes have mostly rotted.
		* On the bed lies the corpse of an elven female, desiccated but not desecrated.
		* The corpse clutches a metal wand some 8” long in its left hand, while its right hand is encased in a blackened leather glove. She wears a linen belt pouch, still remarkably preserved, and a leather backpack.
			* A wand of secret door and trap detection with 25 charges (command word is “reveal” in Elven), two arrows of striking, a gauntlet of fire absorption, and a pouch of capacity.

* Skalla of Westholm died defending his mortally wounded companion from baboons, who died on the bed, resting.
	* The baboons avoid this chamber after their bloody defeat here, many years ago.
	* Skalla’s spirit lingers.  If the woman's corpse is approached, a wordless groan will sound.  If disturbed, the soul of Skalla will return to protect his mistress; his axe will fly to his hand, regardless of its current location, and Skalla will attack.
		* Those viewing the terrible sight must save vs. spells at -4 or flee away in terror for 1-4 rounds.

	* Enormous frescoes of Thoth and his priests occupy the east wall, still largely intact.
	* A stone dais rises 3’ above the floor in the center of the east wall, with a beautiful rosewood chair atop it, carved with ibises and baboons (200 gp, 50 lb).

### 2-29: Sisko’s Lair

* The 10’-tall chamber was the resident of the high priest of Thoth
	* By the west wall sits an enormous statue of Thoth, seated and in human guise.
	* Once extravagantly decorated with frescoes of gilt and lapis depicting priests of Thoth in full ceremonial robes (with tall cylindrical headgear) performing rituals. 
		* Two living mosaics adorn the north wall by the door, depicting the Whispering Hall (2-63), and the Great Hall (3-123).
		* Behind the statue is a fresco showing an ibis emitting rays, with robed figures genuflecting before it (identical to that in 2-4).  Above it the third portion of the Litany of Light (Mithric): “Let the Faithful Render Honor and Glory to the Light Which Reveals All.”
	* A half-dead adventurer named Burris hangs from manacles stapled into the ceiling, tormented by members of Sisko's harem.
		* Phlebotomas’s gang (3-3 to 3-6) captured and traded him to the baboons.
		* He knows about the Hall of Judgment and the halflings’ operations on Level 3.
	* A large mound of clothing serves as Sisko's bed.
	* 3 dead goats and 2 dead goblins hang from hooks on the east wall.
	* A rectangular stone water basin lies against the south wall.
	* Two leather sacks hang from a hook in the ceiling, out of reach of his harem.
		* Sack 1: 343 cp pieces, 277 sp, 156 gp, and 5 ancient octagonal platinum coins. 
		* Sack 2: a femur made into a flute, a conical bronze helmet, a pair of red silk slippers, a black glass activation square, a gold Sortian eye, a jar of candied oranges, and a set of silver chess pieces (400 gp).
	* Secret Door (east): opens only to either the high priest's key 2-31 or 2-43, or a Thothian passkey, or chanting the third mantra of the Litany of Light (“All Glory to the Light of Knowledge”)
		* It leads to a network of tunnels used by the high priests to spy on their subordinates (2-30).
	* Sisko, the alpha male of the giant intelligent baboons, resides here.
		* If no punishment ceremony is taking place in 2-35, Sisko will be here (20%), or he will be holding court in 2-28 (80%).

### 2-30: Spy-Holes and Secret Doors

* A network of narrow, cramped tunnels of poorly-finished, undecorated rock, filled with cobwebs, used by the high priest to spy on his underlings.
	* Cleverly concealed spy-holes at 2-11, 2-27, and 2-32 view these chambers.
* Secret Doors
	* (near 2-12 and 2-27):
		* corridor-side (hard to find 1-in-8, opens to high priest's key (2-31 or 2-43) or a Thothian passkey).
		* tunnel-side (1-in-4 to find, an iron pull hidden near the ceiling opens it)
	* (to 2-31):
		* high priest’s secret lab (normal to find, open by pressing a panel near the floor inwards, then pulling it upwards).
	* (to 2-29):

	* (to 2-34): 
		* corridor-side (normal to find, opens to high priest's key (2-31 or 2-43) or a Thothian passkey).
		* tunnel-side (1-in-4 to find, an iron pull hidden near the ceiling opens it)

## Level 2: 31 - 45

### 2-31: Hidden Laboratory

* The high priest of Thoth's secret laboratory and workshop, to which he and a select few of his inner circle had access.
	* The chamber is lit by torches (illusions, see the devil below), and almost completely undecorated, save for a huge white ibis head painted over the secret door entrance on the north wall.
		* The ibis head's eyes follow those moving in the room, and it acts as a magic mouth for Thoth: anyone opening the door and leaving the chamber hears the ibis intone in a booming bass voice (secret tongue of Thoth, but comprehensible to all): “Thus always traitors”.
	* The southeast wall of the room contains a long workbench with a variety of wizardly and priestly objects on it.
		* The equipment and consumable materials (10,000 gp) are difficult to transport.
	* The western wall has two sections of living mosaic showing the Audience Chamber (2-28) and the Judgment Hall (2-35).
	* Against the northern wall is a stone interrogation table with bronze manacles.  Still shackled to the table is the desiccated corpse of a human man.
		* The corpse wears a gold and lapis signet ring with the name “Xerxastes” (50gp); and an earring of protection +2.
* Central Illusion
	* In the center of the room, illusion shows a circular carpet on which are a table, four chairs, and an easy chair.  In the chair slumps a middle-aged man with greying hair, wearing elaborate formal robes and a Thothian headdress.
		* When someone enters, the man stirs, shakes himself, rubs his eyes blearily, and stands confused, peering around at his environment. He is actually the entrapment devil Semillimes, masquerading as the Thothian priest, Arpostas (see below).
	* If Semillimes departs or the illusion is broken, the summoning circle with pentagram becomes visible (hidden by the rug and easy chair).  The desiccated corpse of Arpostas appears where the illusionary table was.
		* The corpse has a bronze key (high priest’s key; usable at 2-29, 2-30, 2-34, and 2-41), his signet ring (platinum and ruby, 250gp).
			* If this ring is presented to the ghost of Ptirasa at 2-41, the PCs may also be able to acquire a Thothian passkey.

The Story
* The true Arpostas dabbled in forbidden summoning magic and was ensnared and dominated by an entrapment devil, Semillimes.
* A priest, Xerxastes, discovered the treachery of Arpostas and reported it to the spymaster, Ptirasa.  Arpostas captured tortured and Xerxastes, and lured Ptirasa into a trap, killing her (see 2-41).
* Arpostas was cursed by Thoth; dying in misery. His devil was trapped in the summoning circle in this room.  Semillimes has been waiting a very long time to escape.

Semillimes has cast an illusion to mask the fact that he is trapped in a summoning circle.
* The carpet obscures the circle.  The table and chairs cover Arpostas' corpse.
* The disguised devil greets intruders jovially in Mithric, introducing himself as Arpostas; thanking them profusely for entering the chamber and breaking the stasis spell which imprisoned him.
* He is intensely interested in the current era, and offers refreshment at his table.
	* If pressed to leave, he acts dizzy, slumping back into the easy chair and saying he needs to recover a bit first.
	* He claims he'll need to garner information here first (gesturing at the living mosaics), aware he has much to learn before reinserting himself in the world.
* If asked about Xerxastes, claims his enthusiastic servants must have blamed the plotting  Xerxastes for his imprisonment.  Why they departed or left Xerxastes, he doesn't know.
* If anyone join Semillimes on the rug (inside the circle), the devil attempts to dominate him/her.
	* If successful, he commands the PC to continue the charade.
* If either his illusion or his domination attempt is detected, Semillimes blithely continues his pretense, becoming slightly shriller in his pathetic requests to the PCs.
* If detected after he has successfully dominated someone, the devil attempts to barter the dominated PC’s life in return for his own ends, namely freedom and promises of service from other PCs.
	* If unsuccessful in bartering, Semillimes commands the dominated PC to erase the circle (friends will see that PC lift the rug, and then scrape at the floor).  He then summons an ice devil (40% chance) to slay the party, before teleporting himself and the dominated PC to Hell.

### 2-32: Trefko’s Lair

* Former barracks for elite guards attendant on the high priest of Thoth, now taken over by Trefko, a giant intelligent baboon.
	* The walls are dirty and streaked with dust and worse, covering images of men in bronze armor and conical helmets marching, spearing animals and monsters, accompanying an ibis-headed man.
	* An huge pile of old robes and blankets occupies the northwest corner, Trefko’s bed.
	* Two dead goats hang from pegs on the east wall, and a leaky barrel of water rests against the south wall. 
		* Trefko has hidden a pretty rock (1,000 gp diamond) in the barrel, very difficult to spot through the water.
* Trefko is an old, canny baboon, not much interested in procreation, and so without a harem.
	* If no ritual of punishment is taking place in 2-35, Trefko will be found here (80%), reclining on his ‘bed’ and eating sweetmeats (bits of meat); or in 2-28 pretending to pay court to Sisko (20%). 

Trefko, giant intelligent baboon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 45; #AT 5; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-10. Special attacks: rend. He wears an inert dwarven life-
stone (see new magic items) on a cord around his neck. It bears the name ‘Schist Corundam’ in Dwarven Runic; the Corundam clan would love to have this object returned to Kazildor.
* Trefko is loyal to Gerrilad, willing to talk first before hostilities, but not to go against Gerrilad's wishes, nor against the other giant intelligent baboons.
* That said, Trefko is no friend of Sisko, and is unlikely to come to Sisko’s assistance if he hears fighting in 2-29 or 2-28.
* Trefko knows quite a bit about Level 2, and is quite willing to talk and reminisce (50% chance) if treated with respect and a lack of hostility.

### 2-33: Robing Room, with Access to SL15-1

* A former robing room.
	* Images of robed priests line the north and west walls, badly worn and, in places, mutilated. A crude image of a simian wearing a strange robe has been scrawled on the east wall.
	* Wooden pegs line all the walls. 
	* A 5’-tall pile of rubble from a ceiling collapse stands in the northwest corner.  The 4' wide hole above leads to a rough tunnel that climbs to SL15-1.
		* A knotted rope hangs from the hole.  Gerrilad uses the rope to access the tunnels exiting at SL15-21 to cut mistletoe and holly. 
	* The room sees a lot of baboon traffic between the Hall of Judgment (2-35) and Sisko’s audience hall (2-28).
		* There is a 25% chance of encountering 2-4 baboons here.
 
2-4 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20, 19, 18, 18; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### 2-34: Passageway

* This corridor extends from 2-33 along the northern edge of the Hall of Judgment.
	* Two doors provide access to the Hall of Judgment (2-35)
	* Secret Door (south, leads to spy tunnels, 2-30)
		* corridor-side (normal to find, opens to high priest's key (2-31 or 2-43) or a Thothian passkey).
		* tunnel-side (1-in-4 to find, an iron pull hidden near the ceiling opens it)
	* Secret Door (east, to 2-42)
		* corridor-side (hard to find 1-in-8, operates by a pull wire stuck to the corner of the wall and ceiling, detached and pulled; causes the secret door to slide up)

### 2-35: Hall of Judgment

* This vast hall was the site of ritual judgment and decision-making for the inner-circle of the priesthood of Thoth.
* The 30’-tall coffer-vaulted ceiling is lit by guttering torches attached to the pillars which form a hallway from the entrance northward.
	* The columns are slim, some 2’ in diameter, and still coated with a flaking, powder blue paint.
* Two daises, each rising 10’ above the floor.
	*  The dais closer to the columns is a bare marble triangle with a 10' trapped, black iron punishment post with two sets of shackles bolted to it with huge staples. 
		* Pressing a stud on the Ruby Chair causes anyone touching the post to take a 1d4 jolt of electricity.
	* At the north end of the room is the marble judge’s dais, supporting a triangular chair made out of an enormous ruby (see below).
		* Behind the chair is a pile of coins (7,562 cp, 6,293 sp, 2,365 gp, and 827 pp).
			* 17047 coins total (44% cp, 36% sp, 13.8% gp, 4.85% pp)
		* Beneath the coins is incised deeply into the stone in formal script (Mithric): “Speak the Secret Name and Claim Thy Reward.”
* The walls are decorated with colossal mosaics of Thoth striding among puny humans.
	* Thoth appears in various forms: an ibis, an ibis-headed man, a handsome Egyptian-style human, a crouching baboon, and a baboon-headed human.
* East and west of the columns are trapezoidal covered pits, 10’ on a side, 25’ deep, and quite dark (2d6 falling damage).
	* The pits open automatically if more than 1,000 lb is placed on the lid; a pair of studs located on the Ruby Chair may also be used to open them manually.
	* The western pit contains 5’ of water and 2 large crocodiles.
		* In pit are 511 sp and a ring of invisibility (requires 1-3 Turns searching).
	* The eastern pit has only 2’ of water, and contains an otyugh.
		* In pit are the control rod for the pyramid at 2-8, and a wand of illumination (22 charges).
* A door to the east leads to the holding cells, while two doors to the north lead to an access corridor.
* Currently the Hall of Judgment is the primary residence of the druid Gerrilad the Grey (2-69), who directs the baboons from atop the ruby throne.
	* Gerrilad is present (75%), conducting judicial interrogations of his own devising.  Otherwise the hall is empty (save for the occupants of the pits).
		* Gerrilad is accompanied by Sisko (2-29), Trefko (2-32) and 6 large albino baboons.
		* A prisoner (from 2-36B through 2-36D) is shackled to the pillar; screaming loudly as he/she is whipped by one of the giant intelligent baboons.
	* If Gerrilad gains the upper hand in battle, he'll have survivors stripped and imprisoned in 2-36.
	* Gerrilad might be willing to negotiate with a powerful-seeming party, but may also attempt to maneuver them over the pits and open the lids.
	* In combat, Sisko and Trefko attempt to grapple opponents and throw them onto the pits, which Gerrilad then opens manually.
	* If Gerrilad the Grey is slain in 2-35, a booming, thunderous voice will immediately declaim one of the Thoth's secret names (“the Thrice-Born Linguist”).
	* Combat or loud noise in the Hall attracts Njal Oakheart (2-36A) to investigate (90%).
 
Note: this room is the destination for the teleport feature found at UP-11. Those teleported here find themselves standing between the ruby chair and the punishment post.

Ruby Chair
* The ruby chair is made of the blood of Thoth, which Thoth’s priesthood in Arden Vul secured through long and onerous service across the planes.  It is simultaneously priceless, immovable, and invulnerable.
* If one sits in the chair and speaks one of Thoth’s seven secret names followed by the phrase “Hear the voices of your servants in their need,” a trickle of 3-30 rubies (1,000-10,000 gp each) will ‘bleed’ forth from the chair.
	* The four most likely ways for a PC to learn one of the names are:
		* If Gerrilad the Grey is slain in 2-35, a booming, thunderous voice will immediately declaim one of the secret names (“the Thrice-Born Linguist”).
		* The ancient tome, Thoth in All His Forms lists four of the seven secret names.
		* The extremely rare text Secreta Secretorum contains all seven names.
		* Consultation with a sage may produce one of the names.

"Oh ye faithful in long service to Thoth, take this boon and further his works upon your plane."
80,000 gp of rubies (100 gp each?)

* This 8’-tall chamber is undecorated.
	* There are two ancient wooden chairs that collapse into dust if manipulated.
		* Resting on one chair is an enormous conch shell (conch of amplification; enchanted to amplify sounds within 50’). The high priest used it to eavesdrop on those employing the Whispering Hall.

	* Against the northern wall are five funeral slabs (gisants), suitable for using as sarcophagus lids.
		* 1) carved to be a generic priest of Thoth (waiting to be finished)
		* 2) carved with the name Ptirasa, depicting an old woman with stringy hair, a short nose, and beady eyes.
			* Bears an inscription (secret tongue of Thoth): “Head Inquisitor and Judge, Ptirasa lived in the shadows even as she pursued the Light.”

				* The scroll reads (secret tongue of Thoth) “Be wary in agreeing to any meetings with Arpostas, for the high priest has abandoned the Light of Wisdom for the folly of chaos. Seek proof in the hidden passages beneath the Hall of Judgment. (signed) Xerxastes.” 
	* Secret Door (east): appears as part of the cave surface.
		* From the cave side, opens if the high priest’s key (2-31 or 2-43) or a Thothian passkey is inserted into a hidden keyhole (-20% to pick).  From the east, easy to find (1-in-4) and opens inward when a rocky knob is depressed.
* The ghost of Ptirasa haunts this chamber even still, although it is largely benign.
	* Manifests shortly after the chamber is entered, a ghostly woman in elaborate ceremonial robes, and hisses (Mithric): “Beware the treachery of Arpostas. He will destroy our work. Warn the others!”
	* The gisants and ghost provides a clues concerning the story of the entrapment devil and Arpostas in 2-31.
	* If proof of Arpostas’s demise (2-31) is demonstrated to Ptirasa, her ghost glides to the south wall and points to an iron key cleverly hidden by a rock spur (a Thothian passkey, which opens all locks on Levels 2 and 3, except those specifically excluded).

(benign) ghost, immune to attacks; no attack form.

6 giant centipedes: SZ S; AL N; AC 9; MV 150’; HD 1 or 2 HP; HP 2(x3), 1(x3); #AT 1; Dmg n.a. Special attacks: poison (+4 to save)

### 2-42: Hall of Seeing

* The long west-leading hallway is dusty and undecorated; it hasn’t seen traffic in a very long time.
	* The ceiling is enchanted to look like the stars over Arden Vul at the current moment.
		* It is so realistic that careful examination is necessary to recognize that it is not the actual night sky.  The ceiling changes as the seasons change.
	* The north wall features a living mosaic of 2-34.
	* The south wall features a living mosaic of the Hall of Shrines (SL2-1).
	* There is a 15% chance that an odd set of tracks run through the dust on the floor from east to west.
	* In the northeast corner is a Thothian teleportation ring (address WH-YE-BL-RE-BK-GR) with no glass activation squares.
	* Secret Door (west): easy from the east (1-in-4), and difficult from 2-34 (1-in-8); detaching and pulling a wire stuck to the intersection of wall and ceiling causes the panel to slide up.

### 2-43: Antechamber

* A simply decorated chamber (yellow painted plaster walls).
	* Two dust-covered corpses in full-length red robes and tall cylindrical hats lie in the center (ancient Set priests).
		* A: belt-pouch (onyx panther figurine, 100 gp), silver holy symbol of Set (10 gp).

	* They found the key during the fall of the city and thought to loot the Halls of Thoth: they were mauled by the constructions in 2-44 and crawled here to die.

### 2-44: Guard Post

	* The ceiling is a cerulean blue, studded with gold stars.
	* The room is lit with perpetually burning torches on the east and west walls.
	* 12' tall statues of ibis-headed men stand in the middle of the north and south walls.

	* Secret Door (south, to 2-45): found normally, concealed in a large fresco of an angry baboon.  It opens when the eyes of the baboon are pressed at the same time.

2 Archontean animated constructs - ibises: SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 42, 41; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/2-8; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and immune to mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit.

### 2-45: Stair of Heroes, to SL2-1

* The secret door from 2-44 leads to a short hallway and then to a stairway leading upwards some 75’ to the legendary Hall of Shrines (SL2-1).
	* The hallway and the staircase are painted with vibrant images of human heroes smiting enemies of Thoth: magic users, warriors, veiled figures, and giant frogs.
	* The paint looks remarkably fresh, although a thick layer of dust lines the area. 
* Secret Door (west): easy to find 1-in-4 from either side, opened by pressing the wall panel inward.

A stone chest remains locked away in this small cave.
* The high priest stored a cache of supplies here in case of emergency. 
* The corridor to the south leads to a small stone step and two spyholes that look out into the cavern of 2-48.
* In front of the chest are two badly mutilated corpses of adventurers.
	* Corpse 1
		* Orange-tinted chain mail with numerous rents and rips (usable Sortian chain mail, but only AC 6 due damage). The smiths at 9-60 could repair the chain mail for the right price.

	* Corpse 2
		* Leather armor, dagger, light crossbow, 20 bolts, backpack, potions of levitation and flying, scroll of the Hekate's Bonds, purse with 10 cp, 30 sp, and 23 gp

* The chest (locked, -5% to pick, and trapped with explosive runes)
	* 10,000 ancient silver pennies, 250 ancient octagonal platinum coins, three golden bracelets (150 gp each), 
	* a silver torc of protection, a copy of the Litany of Light
	* a war hammer +2

### 2-48: Ancient Monolith

* Here the monolith rises 150' from its base at 3-51, out of the gloom, to end in a flattened triangular platform with 8' sides.
	* The platform is roughly 20’ above the opening leading to the west (to the door to 2-49), and is about parallel to the spyholes in the passage extending from 2-47.
	* A pentagram is inscribed on the platform's surface, the incisions filled with liquid silver (now hardened).
		* A small cold-iron coffer rests in the middle of the pentagram.
			* A roughly-smithed box of iron plates, welded together with a silvery solder with no apparent way to open it. The seams can be melted, but this will probably heat the iron plates considerably.
			* Inside: a palm of correction (a form of rudishva useful palm), a tear of Kauket, an insidious bone flute (see new magic items), a platinum key to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D), two flasks of the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet
		* Stepping into the pentagram summons a keqemander demon. It can levitate, and tries to knock enemies off the platform to their doom.

1 keqemander demon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC -2; MV 90’, 150’ flying (Class D); HD 8; HP 55; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/3-18; MR 40%.

### 2-49: Pukel-mander and Charnel Pit

* Crouching in sullen menace, a pukel-mander sits on a ledge over-looking the Great Chasm (2-63A).
	* The ledge falls away behind the statue (10' down), opening into a large natural cavern covered with bones in a layer 3’ deep.
	* In addition to its ‘normal’ properties, this pukel-mander has been enchanted such that touching it with anything other than a tear of Kauket causes 8 heqeti hopping dead  to animate from the charnel pit behind it.
		* 8 heqeti hopping dead (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 3; HP 22, 21, 20, 19, 19, 17, 16, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as ghasts; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells.
		* If defeated, the hopping dead are able to reanimate after 2 hours have passed. The pit only ceases to spawn hopping dead if the ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-37) is cleansed.
	* A concealed door is hidden behind a pile of bones and trash at the far end of the pit.
		* It leads to a cliff ’s edge 135’ above the floor of the cavern of the monolith (2-48).

### 2-50: Doorstep to the Tomb of Isadora (w/ access to SL11-1)

* This darkened hall is only 8’ tall.  It's walls hold five stone doors – three on the north wall and one each on the east and west walls.
	* Covering the walls (and doors) are faded frescoes spattered with baboon dung. Each depicts a woman in a white gown with waist-length yellow hair is holding her right hand out in the universal symbol of ‘stop’.
	* The floor is littered with charred bits of cloth, leather, metal, and bone.
		* Due to the fire and charred remains, the nearby baboons avoid this chamber.
* Every times the chamber is entered, it triggers a permanent programmed illusion.
	* A woman emerges from the middle door of the north wall. She wears a white gown with waist-length yellow hair and piercing black eyes. She holds her hand up and speaks (Mithric) “Stop! You are not welcome. Return whence you came and you will avoid retribution. Proceed and you shall die.”
	* The figure (Isadora - see SL11-19A) interacts in an extremely limited way, responding to questions with further dire threats and warnings.
* Visible Doors
	* All five are false and trapped (normal detection chance)
	* Opening any of them triggers a 7d6 fireball.  There were originally 25 charges to fuel these traps, only 12 remain.  Can be disabled with dispel magic (12th) 
* Secret Door
	* Located on the east wall (hard to find, 1-in-8) and also locked and fireball trapped.
		* The complex lock (-5% to pick) is in a dark part of the fresco
	* The door leads to a set of stairs descending 50’ to a corridor that eastward to SL11-1.
		* Entering 2-50 from SL11-1 does not trigger a fireball.

### 2-51: Enhanced Baboons

* The walls of this cave are natural, but the floor has been smoothed and covered with a thin layer of sand.
	* A 10’-square stone dais dominates the center of the cavern, topped with a circular basin in which burbles a fountain of clear liquid.
		* The liquid is magical, and conveys a wisdom boost of 1-4 points for 1 day.
		* "The Gift of Thoth is clarity of mind"
* A troop of baboons has occupied this chamber for several generations.
	* Thanks to the magical liquid, its members have gained sentience, learning to speak a rude form of Archontean and arming themselves with throwing rocks, crude spears, and stone daggers.
	* They defend their fountain against all comers. They could be placated and reasoned with.

6 enhanced large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 23, 22, 20, 19, 18, 17; #AT special, or 3; Dmg see below, or 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### 2-52: Pool

* This cave holds a pool of clear, cool water on its southern side.
	* The exiled baboons (2-53) come here to drink.

### 2-53: Exiled Baboons

* A natural cave with uneven floors and walls.
	* The baboons that live here are slower, greyer, and leaner than their counterparts in the main cave, older and weaker members exiled from 2-56.
		* 25 weakened large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 13(x6), 12(x6), 10(x6), 9(x7); #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.
	* Numerous baboon skeletons lie on the northern-most projection of the cave (the inhabitants occasionally resort to cannibalism).

### 2-54: Exit to the Ruined City (leading to AV-10)

* A cramped, 5’-diameter tunnel wends upward 225’ to a surface cave (see AV-10).

### 2-55: Rat Lair

* This area is the nexus of a vast network of small tunnels leading to pockets in the rock, where a colony of 50 giant rats and 200 ordinary rats makes its home.
	* Medium creatures have -1 to hit and damage in the wider tunnels, and -2 to hit and damage in the smaller ones.
	* Most of the tunnels are completely impassable without magical means.
		* If able to penetrate the smaller rat tunnels, find a rat nest every 1-4 turns.
			* Might (25%) have treasure: 1-100 cp (45%), or 1-20 sp (40%), or a gem worth 20-200 gp (10%), or a cursed penny (5%).
	* The wide passage from 2-56 continues on to the east, eventually leading to 2-54 (an exit from the Halls).
	* Another wide passage leads northwest towards 2-53; trackers may follow the smell of baboons and/or the presence of baboon dung.
	* Numerous other tunnels start wide, but eventually peter into narrower and smaller rat tunnels.
* Every turn spent wandering in the rat tunnels, there is a 50% chance that 1-6 giant rats and 3-12 normal rats attack the explorers.
	* An encounter always occurs at area 2-55, with either 2-5 baboons (40%), or a pack of 7-14 giant rats (40%), or both baboons and rats fighting (20%).

2-5 large albino baboons (40%) (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20, 19, 18, 18, 16; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### 2-56: Howling Caves

* This massive cyst cavern was used by the priests of Thoth to breed, house, and train the large baboons which served as guardians and symbols of Thoth’s power.  The priests are gone, but the baboons remained and multiplied. 
	* The cave floor is rock covered with layers of sand and dirt.  The ceiling averages 30’ in height.
	* A patch of giant mushrooms grows in the center-north projection of the cave
		* A giant intelligent baboon usually guards this area to ensure that the lesser baboons do not over exploit it. 
		* Buried in the mulch under the mushrooms is the skeleton of a priest of Thoth with a bone scroll case (map of Level 5, a scroll of aid, enthrall, and wyvern watch), a gold Sortian eye.
	* Phosphorescent fungus clinging to the walls, providing some dim light to the area.
* The caves are filled with hooting, grunting, and the sounds of movement.
	* At any given moment several score baboons will be present in the main cavern.
		* They are organized into smaller troops, with individual alphas, and are somewhat territorial.  The giant intelligent baboons can mobilize multiple troops into concerted action.
		* The baboons are particularly aggressive with intruders.  An incautious party is likely to be swarmed within a turn.  Initial contact will be with 1-2 troops, with more troops joining the fray as combat and noise persist.

49 adult albino baboons (see new monsters), in seven troops (21 male, 28 female): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20(x7), 19(x7), 18(x10), 17(x10), 16(x8), 14(x7); #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

##### 2-56a: Dead Creeper Bodies

* The rent and slashed bodies of two carcass creepers lie rotting on the floor of the cave. 
	* The baboons lightly gnawed them, but found them unpalatable.
* The passageway through to 2-57 is narrow (5’ wide) and cramped (6’ tall).

##### 2-56B: Pool

* A seemingly natural 15'-deep pool exists here.
	* In antiquity Thothian mages placed a decanter of endless water in the pool, protected with an invisibility spell.
		* It can could be found with detect magic or swimming around.
		* Removing the decanter soon causes the dispersal of the baboon troops, as they are driven elsewhere in search of water.
		* The decanter puts out a gallon of water per round, roughly equal to the consumption levels of the baboons.
		* If more than half the baboons are killed, the pool will slowly expand to about 20’ larger in all directions before achieving a new equilibrium.
		* If most or all of the baboons are slain, the pool expands greatly
			* It fills the southwestern portion of the cavern to 1' depth before the contours of the cave create a stream that leads to 2-56A, through the passage, to fall into the Great Chasm (2-63A) as the tiniest of waterfalls.

##### 2-56c: Collapsed Wall and Hidden Idol

* A portion of the cavern wall has collapsed, leaving a rough hole 6’ wide by 10’ tall.
	* Behind the collapse is a pukel-mander, peering menacingly through the hole in the wall.
		* Behind the pukel-mander is an ancient passageway that has collapsed. 

##### 2-56d: Rock Outcroppings

* Scattered throughout the Howling Caves are rock outcroppings of various size and height.
* The albino baboons are adept at clambering up these platforms, and may well use them for combat maneuvers.

##### 2-56e: Rat Tunnels

* Several tunnels lead out of the Howling Caves at their eastern edge.
	* A number are small, frequently found at head height or above on the walls, and suitable only for rats or similarly sized creatures; a good score of such tunnels enter 2-56 (only a few are indicated on the map).
	* The area under the rat tunnels is littered with small bones and dung and exudes a strong odor.
		* Amid the refuse are two golden armbands (50 gp each) and a badly battered leather tome containing the Litany of Light.
	* One tunnel, however is about 5’ wide and 8’ tall, and leads straight to area 2-55. 
* The baboons like to hunt rats for meat and the rats scavenge among the baboons’ dung and other refuse, and thus are likely to be encountered in this area of the cave. 

##### 2-56f: Tunnel to Lesser Baboon Caves (Sub-Level 3)

* This tunnel leads south to SL3-1.

### 2-57: Pulsating Arcanum Cave

* This cave was formed as a geode of sickly pulsing orange arcanum, opened up by a now-dried water flow.
	* The opening was after the fall of the city, and cave is unknown to all.
	* Functions as a large, natural pocket of arcanum (see arcanum for how this affects arcane magic). 

### 2-58: Landing to the Howling Caves

* The hallway from 2-62 ends at an ancient portcullis.
	* The lever is on the hallway side.  The portcullis is almost always raised these days, as the baboons do not like to be penned in.
	* Beyond the portcullis is a two-step dais leading down into the great natural cavern known as the Howling Caves.
		* The dais allowed keepers to keep their eye on baboons in the old days.
	* Today this point as a watch post, where six baboons stand guard.

6 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 21, 20, 19, 16, 15, 14, 13; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### 2-59: Store Room

* A plain, undecorated room serving as a supply room for the baboons in 2-56.
	* Along the south wall are hooks which on which hang corpses of various creatures - several baboons, two goblins, a human, a fungal forester, and three giant centipedes.
	* Along the south wall are a dozen old crates holding many dried mushrooms, ~50 freshly-dead giant insects of various species, ~20 lb of dried fruit and vegetables, and ~300 strips of dried meat of various (and dubious) provenance.
	* At the western end are two 4’-tall stone containers filled with water.
		* A 10’-long, enchanted bullwhip is hidden behind the basins. The baboons knew it of old as Snapper, and hate it to this day.
	* An elderly human slave (noncombatant, AC 10, HP 2), raised from infancy to serve, is chained to a staple in the floor.
		* The slave has no name and will be terrified of any intruder. The slave resists any effort to leave, and attempts to return to his servitude at the earliest opportunity. He speaks only rudimentary Archontean.

### 2-60: Umsko the Intelligent Baboon

* This chamber was once used to house the Order of Thoth’s baboon keepers (like 2-61).
	* Umsko, another of the giant intelligent baboons, dwells here alone (50%), or is in 2-63 (25%), or wandering the halls (25%).
	* It is lit by four torches, and he keeps it clean with a reed broom hanging on a peg by the door.
	* Chained (and gagged) to the east wall of the room is Thalia, a female ranger, naked and badly treated by Umsko.  
	* A heavy wooden bed, a desk, and a chair (all of simple workmanship).
		* In the desk are some scratchings in Umsko's attemped Archontean, a quire containing one of The Deeds of Phagtro the Westron; two quill pens, and an ever-full inkwell.
		* Box 1 (under bed) holds Thalia's gear: scale mail, helmet, metal shield, spear, short sword, short composite bow, backpack, two potions of levitation, and a flask of oil of sharpness (+5).
		* Box 2 (under bed): a scroll (scare, hold person, hallucinatory terrain), 2 potions of extra healing, a key to the door in 2-62, and a sack with 256 gp and 348 pp.
* Any open approach to 2-60 may be (33%) noticed by the baboon guards at 2-58. Loud noises here or 2-61 are 75% likely to cause a baboon troop to investigate from 2-56.

Umsko, giant intelligent baboon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 54; #AT 5; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-10. Special attacks: rend. Possessions: an amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items).
* Umsko is considerably more intelligent (and more cruel) than most of his kind.
* He has greater pretensions to culture and civilization.  He eschews the company of female baboons, preferring human or demi-human females.
* Umsko speaks Archontean better than all of the other giant intelligent baboons and often serves as interpreter in interrogation sessions.  He isn't truly literate, however.
* If he recognizes that intruders outmatch him, Umsko will attempt to barter information for his security.
	* He knows quite a bit about the plans of Gerrilad the Grey (2-69), and both how to access the Whispering Hall (2-63) and how to avoid some of the traps in the Hall of Judgment (2-35).
	* If allowed to flee, Umsko will (depending on what he has learned from the PCs) make straight for either 2-35 or 2-56. The other baboons are afraid of Umsko.

Thalia, 3rd-level female Thorcin ranger: SZ M; AL CG; AC 9; MV 120’; HD 3; HP 10 (max 30); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 17, INT 14, WIS 15, DEX 15, CON 15, CHA 12.
* She welcomes rescuers warmly, but will wish to leave the Halls of Arden Vul as quickly as possible. She currently distrusts all male characters, regardless of alignment or species.

## Level 2: 61 - 72

### 2-61: Yamki the intelligent Baboon 

* This chamber was once used to house the Order of Thoth’s baboon keepers (like 2-60).
	* Yamki, another of the giant intelligent baboons, dwells here with his harem of 4 female baboons.  He is present (50%), or is directing baboon troops on Level 2 or in 2-56).  His harem is always present. 
	* The chamber is filthy, with undecorated walls, a guttering torch on the south wall, a strong scent of baboon urine, and general rot.
	* A table and chair stand in one corner.
		* The heavy wooden chair is ebony and covered with beautiful, ancient Ramaali carvings (50 lbs, 200 gp or 400 gp to a collector)
		* The table is cheap and battered wood.
			* On it sits a a silver cup studded with citrine (1150 gp), dented pewter tableware (5 gp), a 2' square ivory-inlaid wooden box (95 gp) holding 735 sp, a returning pebble, and a potion of vitality.
	* A musty water barrel is by the door, while an enormous pile of pelts and clothing occupies the northwest corner.
		* The 4 female baboons of Yamki’s harem are typically found on the pelts.
			* The attack ferociously for 1-4 rounds, but their morale is low.  They attempt to flee after taking 50% casualties.
		* Buried in nest is a cloak of protection +1.
* Any open approach to 2-61 may be (33%) noticed by the baboon guards at 2-58. Loud noises here or 2-60 are 75% likely to cause a baboon troop to investigate from 2-56.

Yamki, giant intelligent baboon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 50; #AT 5; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-10. Special attacks: rend.

Umsko, giant intelligent baboon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 54; #AT 5; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-10. Special attacks: rend. Possessions: an amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items).

4 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20, 19, 18, 18; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### 2-62: Thoth’s Fist

* A 20’ high chamber with a 10'-tall statue resting atop a 10’-diameter circular plinth.
	* The statue is a springing baboon with clenched fists and forearms raised above its head dominates this room.
	* Frescoes on the walls show humans and baboons working together to smash a variety of enemies, including other humans, crocodiles, and bipedal amphibians.
	* Wall mirrors can be adjusted to fully light the room, provided the Well of Light (2-1) has been activated.
	* The room smells strongly of baboons, and clear tracks show many baboons come and go via the southern hallway.
	* In the northwest corner is a large door on which a large human ear is painted.
		* It appears to open by a simple iron lift latch.  If lifted, a poison needle stabs the manipulator (1 damage + loss of 1 point of CON per hour for 1d10 hours; save vs. poison for half CON loss, death if CON drops below 3).
		* A concealed keyhole on the wall next to the door releases a pull from the wall that opens the door.  The keys are held by Gerrilad the Grey (2-69) and the giant intelligent baboon Umsko (2-60).
* Chances for random encounters are doubled here.

### 2-63: Whispering Hall

* This barrel-vaulted chamber (25' high in the center, 15' at the walls) boasts strange acoustical and magical properties. 
	* The interior walls are sheathed in brick topped with a layer of plaster painted a vibrant royal blue, and still mostly intact.
	* Eleven slim floating columns rise 10’ from the floor; they are stone sheathed in flaking painted plaster.
	* The northeast side of the hall opens on the Great Chasm.  A 2’ brick wall extends along the lip of the chas, with a 10’ gap in the center.
	* On the northwest wall, unobtrusive spyholes may be detected as concealed doors, with a secret door between them.
		* Secret Door (to 2-40): 5' wide, 6' tall, difficult (1-in-8) to detect from 2-63. It rotates on a pin, opened by pushing on the upper or lower part of the door.
	* A 10’x15’x5’ platform occupies the center of the hall.
		* An iron rod rises from a 7'-diameter, 2’-tall stone disk topped by an ivory olifant (a tusk-shaped hunting horn), carved with images of ibises.
			* A faint murmur of voices can be heard from the oliphant.
		* The edge of the platform is inscribed (Mithric): “Welcome, Pilgrim to the Hall of Echoes. Name Thyself, and Whisper Thy Message. Thou Shalt Be Rewarded in Thine Ear.  A Secret for a Secret”.
* Whispers
	* Anyone stating their true name, whispering a true message into the olifant, and listening to the olifant’s aperture receives a random message (all languages are magically comprehensible).
	* The high priest would sometimes eavesdrop, from his hidden chamber and spy-holes at 2-40, on his underlings as they employed the device. 
* Encounters
	* 25% chance of a creature from the chasm (roll on chart for 2-63A).
	* 25% chance of Umsko, the intelligent baboon (see 2-60).
		* He will be carrying his key to the door at 2-62 on a string around his neck.

Table D: Interesting Whispers (Antiquity)

D20 Whisper Speaker (if known) and Notes
* 1 I can’t believe it! Finally! The fifth secret name of our lord is ‘Keeper of the Seven Keys’
	* A Thoth priest; for all of the secret names of Thoth, see Secreta Secretorum in Arden Vul books
* 2 Lady Neferet has taken the iron circlet from the archon. It is said she will wear it until she dies!
	* A Thoth priest; important reference to the iron circlet of Ghanor (see new magic items), and its association with Neferet, penultimate high priestess of Thoth (3-127)
* 3 Lord Sethu has flaunted custom and will build himself an extravagant tomb, apparently only yards north of the imperial bridge
	* A Thoth priest; clue to the location of the tomb of Sethu (5-57 to 5-62)
* 4 Hithra the Paleologue told me he has a sure-fire means of curbing the arrogance of Kel Bormol, the Eye of Thoth. Let’s just say that one shouldn’t open the Eye’s chess set in the near future!
	* A Thoth priest; Hithra’s tomb is at 3-36. He imprisoned Kel Bormol in the latter’s own chess set; see SL3-2A
* 5 I saw the high priest carrying the offerings to the treasury beneath the statue of our Lord. Left arm, straight out, does the trick!
	* A (naughty) Thoth priest; a reference to the treasure chamber at 3-23 and 3-24, accessed under the statue in 3-2. Also a clue to the position of the statue’s arm.
* 6 I feel sorry when the tenders bring the security baboons into the Well of Light. The poor things are terrified of the light as it floods through the mirrors.
	* A Thoth priest; a clue about the desirability of restoring the mirror at the base of the Well of Light (2-1), since it will repel the baboons.
* 7 Georgius got in trouble today for placing the colored squares in the wrong order on the teleporter. He popped into the Summoning Hall at the wrong moment and was devoured! Dumb jerk!
	* A Thoth priest; a clue about how to use glass activation squares
* 8 Lord Arpostas has been dabbling in summoning dangerous entities. He doesn’t think I know, but I do. I see his eyes when he returns from his secret tunnels and can tell!
	* A Thoth guardsman; a reference to the last high priest, Arpostas, and his unwise experiments at 2-31.
* 9 In case I do not live to tell the story, I will tell it here. A secure source has confirmed what I expected: Arpostas has summoned entities against the code. But whom shall I tell? And how?
	* Ptirasa, the spy master; and a reference to Arpostas, 2-31. Ptirasa’s ghost is located at 2-41.
* 10 That peon Xerxastes thinks he can betray me to that nosy bitch Ptirasa? He’ll be sorry. 
	* High Priest Arpostas; another reference to the events in 2-31 and 2-41
* 11 Lord Marius the archon has forced the so-called troll thegn to bend his knee to Archontos! At long last we can begin to expand below!

	* A Thoth priest; a reference to the tomb of Marius, 6-154.
* 13 They say that there’s a back entrance to the tombs of the Priors through the supply closet off the Chapter House. That’s a relief, as I hate having to navigate the chasm to the front door.
	* A Thoth priest; A reference to the Tombs of the Priors (3-61) and the two means of accessing it: the chasm (3-38) and the supply closet (3-60)
* 14 Prior Jacobus is getting careless. I saw him disappear through his own seat into some hidden chamber!
	* A Thoth priest; a reference to the Prior’s Study (3-59)
* 15 Those Set bores are so stupid! A child could deduce the answer to their ‘secret riddle,’ needed to proceed beyond the red bridge. Let’s just say that I’m well shielded from their idiocy!
	* A Thoth priest; refers to the riddle at 4-119, and the solution (“shield”).
* 16 Priscus Pulcher paid a visit to the archon and to High Priest Arpostas today. He said he was trying to avert a war, and was off to Archontos to negotiate with the basileus. Some of our own priests have joined his followers east of our precincts. What a shame!
	* A Thoth priest; refers to the growing discord between the Theosophs (in this case the Thoth priests) and the radical sorcerers, or Sortians, represented by Priscus Pulcher
* 17 Those who believe in Priscus Pulcher’s radical ‘egalitarian’ ideas have adopted a stylized knot as their symbol. They blaspheme in calling Priscus the Father of Magic! That honor belongs to Thoth!
	* A Thoth priest; another reference to the Sortians, their symbol, and their poor relationship with the temples
* 18 I know your secrets, bird-brain! That so-called mystery of the pyramid? Ha! A conjurer’s trick. I know it’s just a teleporter to get you to your comfortable chambers. But it does fool the punters, doesn’t it?
	* A Set priest; a reference to 3-11
* 19 It no longer pays to linger by the chasm. Those floating things are getting worse, and more aggressive. Fortunately they burn easily enough.
	* Anonymous; refers to the chasm cephalopods (see new monsters)
* 20 Ptarmis has announced he will not return to the Chapterhouse or to the Great Hall, but will remain in his fungal ‘paradise’. (scoffing noise) He has said he will build his home ‘on high, among the rocks and fungi’.  Fool!
	* A (jealous) Thoth priest; a reference to Ptarmis’s tomb, at 3-174, and to the Great Cavern (3-163 and 3-172)

Table E: Interesting Whispers (Modern)

D20 Whisper Speaker ( if known) and Notes
* 1 Isocritis was right to insist on keeping the portcullis down, so as to keep the undead out.
	* Gerrilad the Grey (3-69); Gerrilad is referring to 2-16, but it holds equally true for 3-21)
* 2 I must leave once more to collect more holly and mistletoe. Let us hope Isocritis does not make his move while I am gone. Fortunately he has not found the passage in the Laboratory.
	* Gerrilad the Grey (3-69); refers to his escape route (2-23) and his distrust of Isocritis Half-hand (3-70)
* 3 At least the druid has agreed to put the stacks off limits until we figure out what’s going on with those word-eating things!
	* Isocritis Half-hand (3-70); a reference to the logovores in 3-70 (see new monsters)
* 4 My information was faulty. The Paleologue’s tomb is actually at the north end of the chasm, not the south end. 
	* An adventurer; a reference to the tomb of Hithra Paleologos (3-36)
* 5 The entrance to the Oracle of Thoth is just west of the Well. I think the middle mouth is the one.
	* An adventurer; a reference to 2-10
* 6 Curse that stupid druid and his monkey ‘court’. I know the route to the famed shrines of Thoth lies just beyond his court and then to the west! If only I could get there, Thoth’s power will be mine.
	* An adventurer; a reference to the route to Sub-Level 2-1, accessed via 2-35 and then east to 2-42
* 7 I know one of those demonic amphibian statues lies along the chasm, just east of here. I think there’s another somewhere on the level below. 
	* An adventurer; a reference to the pukel-mander (see new magic items) at 2-49
* 8 The baboons are deterred by light. If only we could figure out how to get the Well to light up the mirrors!
	* An adventurer; a reference to the Well of Light (2-1) and the mirrors (2-6)
* 9 When I put that enchanted feather on my helmet, the undead stopped attacking. If only Jordin had thought to do the same!
	* An adventurer; a reference to the powers of the feathers of Maat (3-19) in repelling the undead (of 3-22 and elsewhere)
* 10 So it’s clear that the arms of the statues rotate. We tried all combinations on the two obvious ones and heard a click, but nothing happened. Is there a third statue somewhere?
	* An adventurer; a reference to the need to get all three statues (3-2, 3-15, 3-40) into the same position to open the route to 3-23
* 11 We found the main temple of Thoth, to the west of the lesser catacombs, but it had been desecrated. And the tentacles …. (shiver)
	* An adventurer; a reference to 3-71 and the slime kraken (see new monsters) there
* 12 So the goblins hate the halflings, and the halflings hate the beastmen, but the beastmen hate nobody. How can we exploit this?
	* An adventurer; a hint about faction relationships (c.f. 3-3 to 3-6; SL4-23; and 3-138 to 3-158)
* 13 We blew it by pissing off the goblins. They control the route to the Sundered Span, and thus the route to the Troll Lifts. I guess we’ll need to traverse the chasm.
	* An adventurer; refers to the route to the Sundered Span (5-35) and the Troll Lifts (5-55, 6-1 through 6-5), a route which leads from 3-7 to 4-47 and thus to 5-35
* 14 The Obsidian Gates seem to lie at the end of the Hall of Forty Pillars. But how to breach them? Two keys are needed …
	* An adventurer; refers to 5-6
* 15 That country bumpkin of a troll – Gog, I think? – is a lot smarter and more educated than he lets on. I heard him singing in perfect Archontean verse!
	* An adventurer; refers to Gog and his cave (5-2)
* 16 Thosssseee (sszzt) who needssss the helllp of Kerrbog Khan (szzzt) should seeeeeeek hissss flying friendzzz, the dragonfliesz. Bargains (sszzt) must be sealed in blood!
	* Kerbog Khan (SL 12-25) speaking through an automaton about his desire to secure blood for his rituals and workshops.
* 17 The mushroom folk aren’t the problem in the big cavern. It’s that crazy sorcerer, flying around like he owns the place. 
	* An adventurer; refers to Trocadero (3-176) and the Great Cavern (3-163 and 3-172)
* 18 We’ve caught the trace of a few of these Priscian fellows. Tough customers! Their mages are potent, and they are utterly ruthless. They were looking for the tomb of one of their ancient leaders, somewhere off the great cavern
	* An adventurer; refers to the Priscians (9-58 to 9-64 and elsewhere) and the tomb of Lycandus (3-197)
* 19 There’s some sort of safe house at the foot of the Troll Lift. We were told to seek the Sundered Span, turn north to the Lift, and descend to the Inn of the Lost. Sounds dodgy to me.
	* An adventurer; refers to the Sundered Span (3-35), the Upper Troll Lift (5-55), and the Inn of the Lost (6-7 to 6-20)
* 20 They say if you make it to the Peace Door, just north of the lower Troll Lift, that none of the factions will bother you. I think we’re gonna need that…

	* (1-3) minor affliction (GM’s choice; it should have effects, but should not cripple the PC); (4-6) major infliction (PC’s mind snaps and he/she becomes a gibbering lunatic)

### 2-63A: Great Chasm

* This massive fissure extends through most of the dungeon levels.
	* It is generally shaped like a triangular prism, with its apex about 50’ above Level 2, widening as it extends downward 1,600’ through the Halls until it levels out at the floor of the chasm (9-1) far below.

	* Hanging from pegs on the east wall are 6 battered pots and skillets.
	* An enormous cauldron hangs from a hook near the fireplace; Yrsko can swing it into the fire as needed.
	* An archway leads from the kitchen into the refectory, and the pass-through fireplace also allows access between the two rooms.
		* Activity in either room likely attracts attention from the other chamber.
* Yrsko is here 25% of the time, cooking up a foul brew with the questionable aid of his 3 goblin slaves. Else he is in the refectory (2-64, 25%), kitchen (2-65, 25%), or elsewhere in the complex (25%).
	* If he's cooking, there will be 4 baboons present in 2-64, bullied into tasting his slop.

### 2-66: He’s Just a Cook

* This secret passage has remained untouched for centuries.
	* The corridor is narrow, undecorated, and empty save for a skeleton still dressed in a rotting chef ’s toque.
		* The skeleton clutches a parchment scrap in one hand, and a large cleaver in the other.
			* The scrap is a recipe for baboon stew, quite tasty and perhaps worth something to an adventurous chef. Kronos or Estelle (AV-22) would pay 40 gp for it.
		* If the body is disturbed, the skeleton animates to defend its recipe. 
	* Secret Door (east): leads to the corridor between 2-61 and 2-58, easy to spot from the west (1-in-3), normal from the other side. It rests on a simple pin, and opens by pushing inward.

	* A wooden chest lies against the south wall.
		* Contains 3 different sizes of chef ’s toques, a grimy grey apron, various other soiled linens, and a ‘special carving knife’ (dagger +1).

	* Buried in the back is a sack of small gems (40 gems worth 50 gp each); and a silver statuette of a frog-demon (350 gp).
* Gerrilad spends most of his time in the Hall of Judgment punishing interlopers (75%).

18 / 50
X / 35

* Gerrilad the Grey, a half-elf druid, has made himself master of Level 2 by exerting command over the baboons of the Howling Caves.
	* Thoroughly disturbed, he believes he is re-establishing order with a ‘better’ sort of dominant species (i.e., the baboons rather than humans). He treats the baboons with paternal love, and they in turn consider him to be practically god-like.
* Revamp: an elven druid, his mind partly overwritten by a rudishva memory-crystal.  He half-remembers the "failures" of human-based varuda and varumai and has decided he must restart uplight efforts with a new and better species, these promisingly intelligent baboons.
	* His punishments of prisoners are partly about protecting his domain (so many enemies lurking about!), partly punishing humanity for its "treachery" that brought low the rudishva (actually the kaliyani and heqeti) and/or conquering the halls (the ancient Archonteans).

### 2-70: Library of Thoth

* The double doors to the library are locked, with keys held by Isocritis and Gerrilad (2-69).
* Six columns divide the room into a reading area (fore-chamber) and the stacks
	* The columns are black basalt and carved with subtle arcane marks.
	* Continual light placed on the vaulted ceiling 10’ in from the double doors lights the reading area in the fore-chamber.  It does not reach the back of the stacks.
	* The fore-chamber includes two long oak tables with five chairs per side, where scholars would consult books from the library.
		* Six cloaked figures sit at the tables; no books in front of them, actually baboon zombies under Isocritis' command.
	* A heavy oak librarian’s desk, with two drawers and two heavy chairs, occupies the space leading to the stacks.
			* Isocritis Half-Hand customarily works here.
			* The drawers contain various writing tools (quills, parchment, nibs, ink) as well as a pouch of marbles, a bag of chalk, a set of surveying strings and instruments, and a purse with 299 gp.
	* The stacks area holds four 25’-long, 10’-tall, double-sided bookshelves.
		* The library stacks are occupied by a logovore pack which Isocritis created using an ancient ritual he found in the library (using baboon cubs as the base for the ritual). 
			* Although the logovores do not attack their ‘creator’, they are wild and independent, always clamoring for new words.
			* Isocritis enchanted the pillars separating the reading area from the stacks to act as a barrier beyond which the Logovores won’t move.
				* Should Isocritis die or leave the Halls, the enchantment will be broken and the pack free to move.
			* Isocritis and Gerrilad only communicate using sign language in the stacks.
	* Propped against the south wall of the library, behind the stacks, is a 5’-diameter mirror (the missing piece of the mirror from the Well of Light in 2-1).
* Isocritis is found here 65% of the time; otherwise he may be found sleeping at 2-68 (25%) or using the magical laboratory at 2-23 (10% chance).
	* If no punishment ritual is taking place in 2-35, there is a 38% chance that Gerrilad the Grey is here, consulting with Isocritis. 

Books:
* Although greatly diminished since ancient times, the library is still filled with a large number (over 1,000) of codices, divided into sections by Isocritis.
	* Sections (not marked, must be inferred): Spell Books, Histories of the Archontean Empire, Liturgies and Rituals of Thoth, Arcane Theory, and Mundane Knowledge.
	* The majority of tomes are of no great note (20-50 gp each).
	* A majority of the books, and all pertaining to ancient history, cults, and arcana, are written in Mithric.

9 / 19

* The magic user Isocritis Half-Hand agreed to work for Gerrilad for 6 months in order to obtain access to the Library of Thoth.
	* If disturbed and not immediately propitiated, he orders the baboon zombies (the cloaked figures in the fore-chamber) to attack.
	* Isocritis absolutely loathes baboons, to the point getting away from them might be a point to parley on. Given certain incentives and securities, he might even be persuaded to abandon Gerrilad.
	* He also recognizes that Gerrilad is quite insane, but isn't sure of the nature, save that it seems more than ordinary; he knows strange things.

	* Hidden behind the debris is the stuck, locked (+5% to pick), warded door to 2-71.
	* The ward is a 3’-diameter glowing purple glyph (three horizontal lines, with an ‘s’ mark through them, and dots above and below), a permanent glyph of warding (cause fear).
		* It can only be dispelled by 10th or higher level magic user.
		* Those failing a save vs. spells flee in fear for 2-8 rounds.
* The room is layered in centuries of dust, the dwelling of the chief librarian of Thoth.

	* In the middle of the north wall is a pedestal, on which rests a 1’-diameter orb of softly glowing arcanum (80 lbs), covered in dust. 
		* if disturbed, the librarian rises from his bed and attacks.  If replaced on the pedestal, the librarian returns to rest.
		* If defeated, the librarian rises again, with full hit points, after 1 turn, unless burned to ashes.  It tracks the globe and its possessors unerringly.

### 2-72: Secret Library

* One-Way Door: south of the secret door from 2-71 sits a one-way door leading to the east-west corridor.
	* It has a pair of peepholes, allowing Chief Librarians to exit the secret library directly into the corridor leading towards the main Library.
* The secret library of Thoth has remained undiscovered by Isocritis or anyone else in the many centuries since the complex was abandoned.  Originally, it stored the most holy, most blasphemous, and most dangerous texts of the Order.
	* Many of these texts were removed when the last members of the cult abandoned the Halls in antiquity.
	* The librarian, already driven insane by the arcanum, remained with some chosen items that he found himself incapable of destroying (see 2-71).
* This unremarkable chamber has an 8’ ceiling and no decorations.
	* The walls have been hollowed to form book cabinets with wooden shelves carrying the remnants of the library, all old and brittle, liable to snap under any weight.
	* A wooden table with three wooden chairs occupies the middle of the room, all old and brittle, liable to snap under any weight.
		* An unbound quire of 24 parchment folios rests on the table; a diary of sorts written by the librarian from 2-71.
		* Next to the diary are parchment scraps, first drafts of letters.
			* All, save one to Neferet, are uninteresting.

Writings
* Librarian's diary (Mithric)
	* Recounts his discovery of the arcanum chunk, his efforts to master it, and his growing frustration and alienation. The pages become increasing chaotic and raving as the diary progresses.
* Letter to Neferet (Mithric)
	* “To Neferet, high priestess, from Hellas, greetings. Your demand to relocate the contents of the special library to your new residence is impossible to grant. I will be party to neither your fantasies nor your self-aggrandizement. If the Lord of Light wished us to live eternally, he would have granted us this power; to seek eternal life through necromancy is grotesque and a perversion of Thoth’s teaching. Furthermore, your new residence, with its entrance in the Great Hall, is much too public and therefore unsafe. Most of the acolytes cannot learn of the existence of the works which I guard, and to bring them to you would risk too much. You may already have claimed the Circlet from the archon, but you will not steal the heritage of Lord Thoth. Hithra the Paleologue agrees with me. Given this day, April, AEP 1787.”
		* All but the first two sentences are lined out.
		* GM Note: A clue as to the location of Neferet (3-127) and, with her, the iron circlet of Ghanor. It also reveals that Neferet was dealing in necromancy (she is now a greater mummy). For Hithra the Paleologue, see 3-36.
* Books (40 codices)
	* 30 of the codices are very large, measuring 30”x15” and weighing up to 10 lb (their size and weight is one reason why they were left behind).
		* See the Arden Vul books for potential titles to be found here.
