## Bodies of Water

* Swift River
	* swift and strong from the waterfall at AV
	* Crossing the river in the valley without a bridge or ford is very difficult
	* navigable only south of Newmarket; north of it, it's too rocky and fast.
	* trading barges go south to where it joins the great River Elesseios running east to Narsileon.
* Bilstream
	* minor, calm but shallow, not navigable to boats of any significant size
* Muddy River
	* not navigable, swift and cold from the mountains, then lost and meandering in the Valtos Marshes.  silty and sluggish where it reaches the Swift River
* Gold River
	* not navigable, shallow and rocky and cold
	* flecks of gold in the stream bed, can do a bit of panning but it's not too worthwhile
	* not easy to ford most places (runs in a shallow gorge west of the New Forest), but there's a secret ford within the forest, known to the reclaimers, poisoners, and goblins
	* goblins just cross the river via the thick forest trees that arch over the river, sometimes using spider silk ropes
* The Long Run
	* swift and strong, running to Lake Totey where it joins the Swift River
* Hidden Lake
	* a broad lake fed by mountain streams.  An ancient stone tower rises from an island in its center.  Unexplored due to hostile lizardfolk.
* Totey Lake
	* The Swift River and Long Run flow into Totey, and the Swift flows south out of it.
	* Fairly shallow, except in the center.
	* Totey is its Thorcin name.  Originally called Thoth's Eye.
		* The priests of Thoth in old days had an interest in it.  What's sunk in the deep center?
	* Good fishing.

Various ancient archontean ruins scattered about, most picked clean in the interregnum 

Old Forest
* lizardman camps / grottos along the eastern mountain shore of Hidden Lake
	* they reverse / fear / worship the hidden lake island tower
* hidden lake island tower - ancient ophidian site; lab used to experiment on lizardmen and humans, trying to get the rudishva biotech to do what they needed; maybe also the site of plotting against the rudishva.  tombs of ophidian sorcerers?
	* offers a glimpse of the existence of the kaliyani
* Bilstream Falls - where it comes out of the mountains...a cave behind the waterfall
	* hidden elven-bastion of the druid circle
* something else in the middle stretch of the forest?

New Forest
* Reclaimer bandit camp
	* keep an eye on the main road and slip out in innocent seeming disguises to travel elsewhere to strike.  they don't want to localize themselves to the southern New Forest.  They like striking from the rocks around the Spire on the road or river.  they'll also travel down to The Roost and Table Rock to hit boats or road traffic
* Tombs of the Paw: ancient Thorcin shaft-tombs
	* tombs of the clan that once ruled from the Thicket
	* the region around the paw is the main giant spider nesting grounds
* Rocky Ledges - domain of the Lone Pine homunculi tribe
* Poisoner Hideout
	* on the banks of the Gold River, halfway through the forest, in a seemingly empty ruin.  a hidden trail leads from the road south to the ruin
	* they have a stockpile and secondary manufactory for Mortality.
		* they sometimes do a little spider venom harvesting here in the New Forest.  they know the way to the great spider nesting grounds
	* booby-traps and poison, lookouts and snipers to protect themselves
	* the Reclaimers know about smugglers operating in the forest, and could probably figure out where they're laired if they tried.  They don't know what they're dealing in and don't really care.  The smugglers pay them off in coin "to support the rebellion" to be lest alone, and the reclaimers are pretty happy with that.

Hills & Crags
* Bald Hill - why is the top bare of trees / vegetation?  irradiated?  weird rituals?  something buried there?
	* Lost Shrine: concealed on the east side of Bald Hill, a shrine to Arden and Vul.  Serving as the basecamp of a band of doppelgangers posing as dwarves claiming to be here to explore AV to discover and restore the Forge of Zhorak and recover their comrade ???Jasper Malachite??? (5-52)
	* is the shrine somehow the cause of the baldness?
* Watchtowers of Table Rock - ruins of several; ancient archontean? thorcin hill forts?
	* sometimes used by the Reclaimers as hideouts while watching the road for traffic
* The Fingers - gargoyle nests, caves (some natural, but some worked)
	* tombs of the ancient archonteans who inhabited the Moathouse fort in what is now the Fenns?
* The Ibis' Roost - in a fold of the hill, a forgotten shrine of Thoth.  powerful guardians, contains valuable info (maps!) about AV
	* locals just know the hill north of Table Rock as "The Roost", forgetting why
* Lost Mine - west of Deepton in the mountains, archontean gold and silver mine; some Ptah ruins/relics/shrine?

Swamps
- Moathouse of the Fenn - old ruin, some ancient disaster turned this prime farmland into swamp; the Theo-Sort war? something else?
	- there are a few other ruins in this area too
	- below the Moathouse is the site where the rudishva transformed into elves, data crystals that drove Gerrilad crazy and overwrote the minds of the others, making them the niravairi
		* bits of rudishva biotech lab
		- graves, memorials
		- that's all at the bottom, more cruft has built up above as it has been occupied by various groups
	- the disaster was caused by interegnum-era thorcin adventurers tampering with the rudishva site, triggering an accident or countermeasure.  this left the site open for Gerrilad and co to find it
- Valtos Bridge - an attempted road / causeway across the marshes to Castle Burdock, back in the day to improve travel.  failed and now largely sunk.  still an old fort / waypost ruin in there

The Thicket and Broken Knob hill
- magically robust huge thorny thicket, several acres
- ruins of a watchtower atop Broken Knob hill; old thorcin fort, maybe they used magic to grow the thorny wall and it's gotten out of hand down the years
- thicket has also engulfed the tomb of Phagtro the Westron (is it him?) in the base of the hill
- home to a tribe of kobolds? beastmen? homunculi? that use the thorns' protection
	- same Long Pine tribe as on the Rocky Ledges?

Plains
* something in the stretch between Valtos Marshes and southern end of New Forest?
* something south of the Old Forest and north of Ibis' Roost?
* these might just hold some old ruins, now looted?

smuggler's hideout where the poisoners hand off the goods to their contacts to ship out of the valley
