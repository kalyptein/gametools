## Overview

This small sub-level hides the deepest secrets concerning the Sortians, including those concerning Priscus Pulcher, Priscus’s relationship with the mysterious Isadora, and the very nature of Isadora.
* “Isadora” was actually Yasidoranicil, an ancient, huge gold dragon who spent most of her time in human form.
* Isadora passed for decades as an Archontean noblewoman (or her daughter, or grand-daughter) of exceptional beauty, with gold eyes, waist-length raven hair, and surpassing taste.
* Her villa outside the walls of Arden Vul was a hub of social and intellectual activity during the final years of the city’s greatness.
* Isadora’s true nature was known only to a tiny circle of Priscus’s closest Sortian friends and allies.

The core of the sub-level is a 150’-tall octagonal chamber (SL11-12) located deep beneath the cellars of Isadora’s extramural villa.
* This sanctum was designed by Isadora as a private retreat for herself and a handful of her friends (increasingly this meant only Priscus Pulcher).
* It also came to be the site where she chose to conceal her substantial hoard of treasure.

Eventually, as she foresaw the inevitable destruction wrought by the War of the Sortians and Theosophs and the demise of her lover Priscus, she also chose this site as the place where she, too, would end her days.
* After Priscus surrendered himself to the imperial authorities in Narsileon for trial, torture, and execution, she recovered his battered remains and brought them here (SL11-24).
* When the vengeance of the Sortians and their magical allies fell upon Arden Vul, she retreated in sorrow to her sanctum and ‘took to the stone’ (i.e., slowly died, reverting to the mineral state closest to her nature – gold).

Isadora’s sanctum and eventual tomb was extremely well-hidden.
* She naturally chose to hide herself and her lover’s relics directly under the nose of their fiercest enemies, that is, close beside the subterranean complexes built by the great temples that had so opposed the work of Priscus and the other Sortians.
* She accomplished this task with the complicity of several Sortian sympathizers highly-placed in the hierarchies of the temples of Thoth, Set and Horus, and through the expenditure of considerable magical energy.
* To protect the site, Isadora and her architects limited the number of routes by which the complex could be accessed to two and ensured that one of the two access routes was protected with numerous traps (areas SL11-2 to SL11-11).
* The result is a complex that has been almost completely hidden for more than 1,200 years, a complex that contains substantial treasures but deadly dangers.

General Construction Notes
* Archontean areas: all areas are Archontean

Magical Restrictions 
* The crystal cavern (SL11-12) and its neighboring chambers (SL11-13 to SL11-24) are protected by a permanent zone of anti-scrying and anti-summoning magic.
	* Clairaudience, clairvoyance, divination, commune, all monster summoning spells, gate, and any other similar spells or magical effects (including from magical items and innate abilities) are ineffective in these areas.
* Isadora called in favors from her Sortian friends to accomplish this impressive feat, hoping thereby to add a layer of protection to her chosen sanctum.

Access and Egress
* To Surface: stairs at SL11-18, leading up to AV-20
* To Level 2: corridor at SL11-1, leading to 2-50 

Random Encounters
* There are no random encounters in this sub-level.

## Areas

### SL11-1: Corridor to Level 2 (2-50)

* This corridor runs 150’ west before climbing 50’ of stairs to the door at area 2-50.
	* The corridor is coated with a thin layer of dust; no footprints disturb it.

### SL11-2: Hall of Foreboding

* This 20' tall octagonal hall, covered in a thin layer of dust, is dominated by a 13’-tall, basalt statue of a helmed archon facing west, on a 2’ plinth.
	* The statue's arms are outstretched, palms out (indicating ‘stop’).
	* Its clothing and equipment are brightly polychromed in blues, greens, and yellows.
	* A garrulous mouth (new spells, 12 remaining iterations) speaks when approached from the west (Mithric): “Woe! Dread! Retreat! You are not welcome!” (repeated three times per activation).
	* A subtle search reveals:
		* The wrists of the statue rotate on pins, allowing the fingers of the palm to face south (left), upwards (the default position), or north (right).
		* The eyes may be depressed.
* The chamber has three secret doors, each of which may be detected normally.
	* Secret Door (north): opens when the statues’ fingers point north.
	* Secret Door (south): opens when the statues’ fingers point south.
	* Secret Door (east): opens by depressing both of the eyes of the statue.
	* The doors are unlocked by these manipulations of the statue, retracting three iron bars that lock the door(s) in place (able to defeat Knock and similar opening magic).
	* The doors can be broken down, but are solid stone.

### SL11-3: Secret Passage

* This 5’-wide corridor twists around three corners before ending at a one-way door leading into SL11-4.
	* The stone door appears normal from outside: a handle is turned, releasing an inner bar and opening the door.
	* The door shuts automatically 1 Turn later (unless spiked open) and the inner bar slides back into place (preventing Knock).  It is all but invisible from inside.
* Thirteen 2' tall letters of inset blue lapis line the floor (20 gp per letter). The letters are sequential, starting with ‘D’ closest to SL11-2 and ending with ‘Y’ near SL11-4: D-E-N-R-A-W-E-R-E-W-O-U-Y.
	* If one reverses the letters (or reads them from south to north) they say “You were warned” in Mithric.

### SL11-4: Trap: Endless Corridors

* A nasty trap designed to prevent tomb robbers from locating the sanctum of Isadora (SL11-19 to SL11-24).
* Four 50’-long corridors stretch from a four-way intersection, each ending in a wooden door.
* 
	* 
	* 
	* ????
	* 
	* 
	* Opening any door teleports all within 20’ to the analogous section of corridor in front of the diametrically opposite door. So, those facing door A are teleported to a point just inside door B; those facing door C are teleported to a point just inside door D; and so forth. At least initially, those teleported may well believe that they have merely entered a new section of similar corridors and doors. It may take some experimentation to realize that the party is being teleported within the same limited complex.

### SL11-5: Long Natural Tunnel

* After 20’ of worked stairs, this corridor become a long, 6’-tall, unworked tunnel that twists and turns, climbing up and down over small lumps of harder rock, for 150’.
	* Eventually it connects to a short section of worked stone stairs that descend 20’ to the Hall of Guardians (SL11-6).

### SL11-6: Hall of Guardians

* This 20’-tall hall has two balconies on either end that lead down short (5’) staircases to the main floor.
	* Two imposing rows of 8’-tall stone statues flank the central path through the hall.
		* The statues are inert until the exact center of the hall is reached, when they animate and seek to destroy intruders.
			* Flying through the chamber (never touching the center of the hall) or displaying (each person) a sapphire Sortian eye prevents animation.
	* A heavy iron portcullis blocks the eastern side of the hall.

* Statues: All ten statues look identical, a man of late middle age dressed in the formal toga of an archaic Archontean aristocrat.
	* The man’s face is lined and wrinkled, with crow’s feet and thinly pursed lips.
	* The left arm clutches a long scroll case; the right is a clenched fist raised above his head (the standard gesture of anger in formal Archontean rhetoric).
	* GM Note: Those familiar with Sortian iconography will realize instantly that the statues, like Sortian faces (new), depict the generic image of the Philosopher.
* Despite appearing identical, the statues are slightly different once animated.
	* Six are standard animated orators, two are hasted, and two are ‘shell’ orators whose ‘bodies’ contain poison dust.
	* The hasted orators move to attack ‘those wearing raiment’.
	* The poison-filled orators attack ‘those in armor’
	* The regular orators attack at will.
* If combat lasts >5 rounds in this hall, the portcullis to SL11-7 opens, releasing the imperial stone guardians to join the combat immediately.

### SL11-7: Imperial Stone Guardians

* A heavy iron portcullis blocks access from this chamber to area SL11-6.
	* Two imperial stone guardians (new) stand on either side of the door in the east wall.
		* They activate if combat endures for >5 rounds in SL11-6 or if the portcullis is raised or broken.
		* They stone guardians pursue into all areas of the sub-level that are accessible to them (they cannot fit into 5’-wide corridors, so SL11-3 is safe).
	* Secret Door (north): opened by pushing the door panel inward.

2 imperial stone guardians (new): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 60, 60; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to 
missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

### SL11-8: Pit Trap and Chest

* The corridor is empty with a wooden chest at the far end, beyond a hidden pit trap..
	* The pit is triggered by a pressure plate on the solid floor of the eastern part of the corridor (just before the chest).  The leader will be safe but trapped; followers will fall.
	* The pit is 40’ deep. The lid automatically closes after a Turn.
* The chest is locked.
	* 10,149 ancient silver pennies.  Mixed in are 5 cursed pennies (new magic). 

### SL11-9: Octagonal Chamber of Sorrow

* The wooden door from SL11-2 is locked (key long gone); must be picked or destroyed.
* A 15’-tall octagonal chamber.
	* The four walls without doors are decorated with still-vibrant frescoes depicting Priscus Pulcher in various of his endeavors.
		* He lectures students
		* He presents a petition to the emperor
		* He disputes with a group of orange-robed priests of Thoth
		* He stands next to an enormous gold dragon.
	* Wooden (false) doors on three of its eight walls.
		* Each opens normally, revealing a shallow indentation holding a Mirror of Life Trapping.
			* The opener must save or be sucked in; others in line might also glimpse it.
			* Each mirror is unoccupied (east has 13 cells, west has 18 cells, north has 14 cells). Isadora owned the mirrors; the command word for each is "Priscus" (release), "Isadora" (speak to), "Null" (suppress).
	* In the center of the chamber is a 4’-tall circular basin filled with murky water.
		* Murky, still water fills the basin; stale and unappetizing.
		* The water conceals a 4’-diameter secret panel on the floor of the basin (1-in-8 to spot).
			* Sealed with gum to prevent leaking.  Must be prised up (bend bars if full of water).
			* If opened, the panel reveals a 20’-deep hole that drops down to area SL11-10.

### SL11-10: Long Natural Tunnel

* This 5’-tall natural tunnel extends 150’ from the hole under SL11-9 over numerous humps, bumps, and dips until it turns into a standard Archontean-worked corridor and climbs 20’ of stairs to SL11-11.

### SL11-11: Hall of Confusion and Illusion

* This large hall is 20’ tall with a barrel-vaulted ceiling. The walls are covered with frescoes of dragons flying amid clouds.
	* Two substantial sections of the floor are illusory, and cover 60’ deep pits.
	* Three large statues stand in a row in the center of the chamber, each on a 2’ plinth.
		* Five rounds after the first living being sets foot on the solid ground in the center of the hall, all three statues animate.
		* The attempt to use their confusion attacks to disorient attackers and then push them into the pits.
		* The golems are unable to leave the central portion of this chamber.

* Statue (center): 15’-tall black basalt, depicts Priscus Pulcher in the robes of a traditional Archontean wizard.
	* He appears as an extremely handsome young man with close-cropped hair, a trim beard, a gentle smile, and laughing eyes.
	* Eyes are huge sapphires (2,500 gp each)
* Statue (north): 12’-tall white marble, depicts a human female with waist-length hair and a staff gripped in both hands.
	* Isadora in human form (for more on Isadora, see SL11-19A).
	* Eyes are huge black opals with golden flecks (2,000 gp each).
* Statue (south): 12’-tall gold-flecked marble, depicts a sinuous dragon with lower body coiled and upper torso rising up to face the chamber.
	* Eyes are huge black opals with golden flecks (2,000 gp each).

3 modified stone golems: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 14; HP 60(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 3-24. Special attacks: confusion (instead of slow) once every other round. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to most magic.
* In addition to their usual vulnerabilities, the golems can be halted if their eyes are removed or destroyed. 

### SL11-12: Crystal Cavern 

Note
* The crystal cavern (SL11-12) and its neighboring chambers (SL11-13 to SL11-24) are protected by a permanent zone of anti-scrying and anti-summoning magic.
	* Clairaudience, clairvoyance, divination, commune, all monster summoning spells, gate, and any other similar spells or magical effects (including from magical items and innate abilities) are ineffective in these areas.
	* The walls are also resistant to shaping or dimensional magics (teleportation, etc).
	* Isadora called in favors from her Sortian friends to accomplish this impressive feat, hoping thereby to add a layer of protection to her chosen sanctum. 

* An enormous cave rises some 110’ above its sandy floor, it's walls and ceiling studded with impressive columnar quartz formations.
	* Any light causes an array of multicolored beams to scatter crazily across the walls.
	* There are three ‘levels’ to the chamber.
		* The upper (SL11-17, 110' up)
		* The middle (SL11-13 to SL11-16, 70' up, accessible from SL11-7 or SL11-11)
		* The floor (SL11-19)
	* An 20' wide octagonal area of worked stone lies in the center of the ceiling.
		* 2-in-6 chance of noticing; it lacks the reflecting crystal columns
		* This is a permanent illusion masking the aperture leading from the crystal cavern into the upper level (SL11-17). 
	* Four niches on the middle level of the crystal cavern are connected around the rim via a 5’-wide ledge.
		* Each contains an exquisitely-carved, 8’-tall statue of marble (clothing) and ebony (flesh) (10,000 gp each).
			* Minutely examination finds that the head of each statue is set on a  thick  iron pin and can be rotated or removed (15 lbs).
			* All four statues detect of magic.

Puzzle
* The heads and bodies of the four statues have been mixed up, such that the wrong head sits atop the wrong body.
* Only close observation will make this fact apparent; the expression of the heads, the posture of the bodies, and the Mithric inscriptions on the plinths are the clues.
	* Various stylized poses, actions, etc requires substantial education and/or knowledge of ancient history / rhetoric to parse, or 5d6 under INT.
* Correctly restoring the proper head to its proper body is the only way to unlock the mechanism at SL11-19A allowing access to the hidden sanctum of Isadora (SL11-24). 
* When any single head is returned to its proper body, an audible ‘click’ may be heard.
	* A dispel magic is now required to removed the head.
* When all four heads are correctly installed, a loud sigh is audible, as of gas under pressure being released.  The mechanism at SL11-19A that leads to SL11-24 becomes operable.

The following chart identifies each statue and the current location of its proper head:

Name                                          Body          Head
Livia Cuspianus the Lictor (F)       SL11-13    SL11-16
Hortensius Greywand (M)            SL11-14    SL11-15
Macrinus Furiosus (M)                  SL11-15   SL11-13
Placida Gorgitrex, the Judge (F)   SL11-16    SL11-14

### SL11-13: North Balcony with Statue (Livia)

* Secret Door (west): no mechanism exists to open it from this side.

Statue
* Body: a female human in the toga of members of the imperial bureaucracy.
	* A set of sticks wrapped in cloth with a javelin protruding lies at her feet (the fasces of a lictors).
	* Her pose reflects the classical Archontean rhetorical gesture for supplication: both hands raised neck-high and held slightly apart, palms cupped towards each other.
* Head: a rather severe looking man of advanced age with a roman nose and a scar running along his left cheek, mouth is twisted in an expression of anger.
	* This is Macrinus Furiosus' head (see SL11-15 for his body).
	* Livia’s head may be found at SL11-16.
* Plinth Inscription (Mithric): “Livia the Lictor, whose efforts to placate the implacable tyrants served as an inspiration to Priscus.”

Clues
* Livia is a female name, and the head is clearly male
* The inscription and the torso’s pose suggest that the proper face should reflect ‘placation’ or ‘supplication’, and not ‘anger’.

Livia Cuspianus
* One of the great Sortian heroes from the from the War between the Sortians and Theosophs.
* She had been trained in the Order of Thoth (the sole school for magic users at the time), but was sympathetic to Priscus Pulcher’s call for democratization of magical training.
* As an imperial official (lictor) she worked hard as a mediator between the discontented Sortians and the powerful, entrenched temples (the Theosophs). 

### SL11-14: East Balcony with Statue (Hortensius)

Statue
* Body: a male mage in the archaic formal attire of the ancient Order of Thoth: starched, heavy robes, wooden clogs, with a staff leaning against his chest.
	* His pose reflects the classical rhetorical gesture for approval or applause: hands held before him in ‘clapping’ mode.
* Head: a middle-aged woman wearing a striped hood to cover her hair (the back of her toga pulled up over her head). Her eyes show laugh-lines, but her mouth is set in a neutral line.
	* This is Placida Gorgitrex, the Judge (see SL11-16 for her body).
	* Hortensius’s head may be found at SL11-15.
* Plinth Inscription (Mithric): “Hortensius Greywand, third proctor of the Order of Thoth, who approved Pulcher’s ideas publicly and privately.”

Clues
* The gender of the head and body do not match
* The inscription and posture of the body require a face that is marked by approval (e.g., smiling). 

Hortensius Greywand
* One of the ruling council of the Order of Thoth at the time when Priscus Pulcher and the other radicals pressed for opening the study of magic to all those who showed the talent.
* Alone among the seven proctors, Hortensius signaled his approval of the Sortians’ plans; his support ensured that the Order would not unanimously move against the Sortians.

### SL11-15: South Balcony with Statue (Macrinus)

Statue
* Body: The statue depicts a male magic user in the traveling attire appropriate to antiquity: puttees, breeches, a loose tunic, and a haversack slung across his chest.
	* His left hand holds a wand close to his body, ready for action. His pose reflects the classical rhetorical gesture for threat or anger: right hand held up with clenched fist.
* Head: The head depicts an older man wearing the starched, five-cornered hat of the proctors of the Order of Thoth. His eyes are crinkled with laughter, and his mouth is smiling and wide.
	* This is Hortensius Greywand (see SL11-14 for his body).
	* The head of Macrinus Furiosus may be found at SL11-13.
* Plinth Inscription (Mithric): “Macrinus Furiosus, whose ferocity brought low the Theosophs and forced them to negotiate.”

Clues
* The distinctive starched headgear of the provosts of the Order of Thoth might still be recognizable to modern magic users (roll 4d6 under INT); at the very least its formality contrasts with the loose clothing of the body
* The inscription and posture of the body require a face that depicts equally strong, angry emotions.

Macrinus Furiosus
* A young companion of Priscus Pulcher who ended up as a leader of the hotheads among the Sortians.
* Eschewing Priscus’s attempts to obtain their ends through peaceful means, Macrinus and his friends engaged in hit-and-run attacks on prominent Theosophs.
* Eventually, thanks to their victory at the Battle of the Burning Sands, the temples and emperor finally agreed to a truce.

### SL11-16: West Balcony with Statue (Placida)

* Secret Door (west): no mechanism for opening it from this side.

Statue
* Body: a female figure dressed in the vertically striped toga of a krites (judge).
	* The sculptor has clearly indicated the stripes in the marble.
	* Her pose reflects the classical Archontean rhetorical gesture for protection: both hands are extended, palms facing outward.
		* Modern Archonteans will have a much easier time recognizing the striped toga, as current kritai continue to wear it (4d6 under INT also recalls that kritai wear their toga as a hood when rendering decisions)
* Head: The head depicts a young woman with a page-boy haircut.  She possesses lively eyes, and her mouth is open, as if she is speaking.
	* This is Livia the lictor (see SL11-13 for her body).
	* The head of Placida Gorgitrex may be found at SL11-14.
* Plinth Inscription (Mithric): “Placida Gorgitrex, the wise and neutral judge, whose proper interpretation of the Ennian Code offered legal protection from proscription to the Sortians.” 

Clues
* The clothing of modern Archontean kritai (judges) is distinctive: judges wear a vertically-striped toga with its back pulled over the head in a hood.  Viewers might recognize the stripes on this statue and recognize that a hooded head is necessary
* The inscription names Placida Gorgitrex as a judge and cites her neutrality, while the pose mentions protection; look for a head whose head implies legal calm, reason, and neutrality.

Placida Gorgitrex
* A krites at the time the conflict between the Theosophs and Sortians reached a head.
* When pressed to rule that the Sortians had broken the ancient Archontean legal code (The Ennian Code), she refused, noting that they were protected by their status as citizens.
* Privately she held Priscus and his friends in contempt, but as a judge she proved an important ally.

### SL11-17: Cellar with Illusory Floor

* Those accessing this area from SL11-18 see an octagonal chamber resembling a storage cellar, with boxes and barrels lining the walls.
	* Secret Door (west): opens by inserting a rod into a 1”-diameter hole in the floor, left of the door.
	* The boxes and barrels contain long-spoiled foodstuffs and beverages: grain, dried fruits, nuts, dried vegetables, wine, brandy, etc.
		* Can find a bag of silver dust (5 gp) and two moonstones (50 gp each) by rooting around in the smelly remains for 2d4 turns.
	* Unusually, the center of the chamber has no clutter, but instead features an impressive and detailed mosaic (20’ from side to side) showing a man and woman standing next to each other, eyes glittering like gems, surrounded by an inscription.
		* The inscription reads (Mithric): “Priscus and Isadora stood together against adversity. Their eyes revealed more than would have been thought possible.”
		* The mosaic is a permanent illusion that covers an open hole in the floor.
			* The hole connects to the crystal cavern (SL11-12).
			* The inscription and eyes are designed to lure greedy tomb robbers by suggesting the eyes of the figures in the mosaic might produce some beneficial result.

### SL11-18: Spiral Staircase to the Ruined City (AV-20)

* Oversized (for humans) rough, circular, granite stairs climb 150’ to the basement (AV-20).
* Secret Door (east): easy to find (1 in 4) from this side, opens by pulling the door inwards.

### SL11-19: Floor of the Crystal Cavern

* The floor level of the cavern takes the form of an octagonal chamber of worked stone.
	* The smooth stonework extends 15’ up the walls before transitioning into crystals.
	* The floor is rough, and covered with a 3’ layer of sand.
	* Worked stone plinths rising 5’ above the sand line the north and south walls
		* Four of the plinths are semi-circular, and contain statues (Archontean animated constucts, orators).
		* The north and south plinths are trapezoidal and contain regular doors.
		* Door lead east and west (SL11-22 and SL11-23)
			* They are at floor level and their bottom halves are covered by sand.
	* The center of cavern is dominated by a 5’-tall plinth holding a glimmering, gilded life-sized statue of a huge (20' high), ancient gold dragon (see SL11-19a).
		* The statue is protected by a delicate semi-circular canopy of stone supported by four 25’-tall basalt columns.
			* Those falling from SL11-17 bounce off the canopy and onto the sandy floor to one side. 
	* A 15’-long, 8’-wide, and 7’-deep pit covered by a wooden lid is buried beneath the sand between the dragon statue and the doors to SL11-22.
		* Within the pit is a formidable iron golem tasked with defending the chambers of Isadora.
	* Four corpses of tomb robbers lie in around the central statue.
		* They fell from above, tricked by the illusionary floor at SL11-17.
		* In several purses: 27 sp, 41 gp, 19 ancient silver pennies, 33 ancient gold solidi; even carnelians (50 gp each)l a suit of chain mail +2, a wand of magic detection (29 charges), a scarlet & blue ioun stone, a dagger of throwing +3, two coils of elven rope (new); two crowbars; a block and tackle; a copper statuette of a turtle (35 gp); and a treasure map of the GM’s choice.

* Touching the dragon statue or attempting to open any of the four doors without the proper key causes all four constructs to animate, and the iron golem to wake.
	* The constructs immediately attack.  The golem takes 2 rounds to batter its way out of the sand-covered pit. 

1 iron golem: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 18; HP 80; #AT 1; Dmg 4-40. Special attacks: poison gas. Special defenses: +3 or better weapons to hit; immune to all magic except electricity, which slows it; healed by fire.
* Armed with a quiver of huge javelins (4d6), and able to throw rocks.  Lots of both inside the pit.

4 hasted Archontean animated constructs - animated orators (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 48, 46, 42, 40; #AT 2; Dmg 3-12/3-12. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells.
* Club w/ stone "scroll"

##### SL11-19a: Isadora the Gold Dragon

* This gilded statue towers over the center of the crystal cavern, depicting an ancient, huge, gold dragon, rising above the sandy floor on a 5' plinth.
	* Its rear section is coiled on the plinth, its fore parts rising up as if it is gazing across the cavern.  If stretched out, the dragon would be 53’ long with an 8’-diameter head.
		* Reminder: touching the golden statue activates the golem and constructs in SL11-19
	* The plinth bears a lengthy inscription (Mithric).
		* “Yasidoranicil, wiser counsellor to the wise mages, whose generosity supported the Sortians in their darkest hour. She loved Priscus with all her great heart, and bore away his earthly remains after his body had hung for three days above the Cemetery Gate in Narsileon.”
	* On the east side of the plinth is a flattened section of stone 8’ wide; it covers a hole leading to SL11-24. 

The Dragon
* The statue appears to be coated with glittering, untarnished gold.
* It is, in fact, solid gold, and weighs something like 100,000 lb.
* In terms of sheer value by weight, this is a treasure of immense value, worth in the neighborhood of 5 million gp.
* As an art object, moreover, the value would probably increase by 25%.
* Unfortunately, the gold is cursed, by whatever powers favor dragons.
	* Breaking apart the statue does not trigger the curse (?), pocketing (or placing in a purse, backpack, etc.) even the smallest piece of gold puts the twin curses into effect.
		* The curse marks the victim as an enemy of dragonkind (regardless of alignment); no dragon will negotiate with the victim or them with mercy.
		* The victim ceases to be able to recognize gold. Instead of gold, the victim may see pyrite, brass, copper or yellow rocks. This includes pieces of Isadora herself, such that as soon as a piece is ‘possessed’, the possessor ‘recognizes’ that it is not, in fact, gold at all.  This "knowledge" is overwhelming; even direct proof (chemistry, magic, assurance of a trusted friend, etc) will quickly twist in the mind into a trick or mistake.
	* These curses are so powerful that they may only be reversed by remove curse cast by a 15th-level caster or by the use of wish.

Puzzle and Secret Door (covering the hole to SL11-24)
* the plinth supporting Isadora’s ‘body’ covers a 4’-wide hole leading down 30’ to SL11-24.
	* 1-in-12 chance to notice the secret door.
	* The slab can only be moved when the puzzle involving the statues at SL11-13 to SL11-16 is solved.
		* When the heads are returned to their proper bodies, an audible ‘hiss’ is heard, and part of the slab slides back an inch into the plinth.
			* Detection becomes easier (1 in 4 chance) and the slab can be pushed inward. 
	* Hand- and foot-holds carved into the side allow climbing up or down.

* GM Note: The statue is literally Isadora, or Yasidoranicil, the gold dragon who became the lover of Priscus Pulcher and secret supporter of the Sortians during the War of the Sortians and Theosophs.
	* Ancient dragons that approach the end of their lives without suffering violent death may elect to transform themselves into a semblance of the material described by their sub-species.
		* Metallic dragons turn into the metal of their name (copper, gold, bronze, etc.), while chromatic dragons turn into stone of the appropriate color (red porphyry, white marble, black granite, etc.).
	* It is possible, albeit extremely difficult (requiring sages, wishes, and substantial questing), to ‘wake’ a dragon that has ‘taken to the stone’.
* After Priscus sacrificed himself to the imperial authorities in an effort to end the war, Yasidoranicil gathered up his broken and tortured body and bore it here, to her sanctum.  Tired of life, she chose to ‘take the stone’.
