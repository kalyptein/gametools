## Overview

This level is home to the dreaded heqeti ziggurat built in honor of the mighty demon prince, Kauket (see areas 10-32 to 10-37). The ziggurat, with its surrounding marsh and heqeti structures, has existed in some form or another for almost 3,400 years. Despite having been ‘cleansed’ twice in antiquity (once by the rudishva and once by the Archonteans), the heqeti have returned from their hidden homes in the Underearth to re-sanctify their site. The ziggurat is once again operational, and the heqeti are starting to reoccupy their ancient halls. 

The centerpiece of the level and, in some ways, culmination of the dungeon is the enormous cavern that is occupied by a stinking marsh (10-15) and by the ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-37). Causeways and bridges lead through or above the marsh so as to connect the ziggurat with heqeti dwellings delved from the surrounding rock. To the heqeti, this area constitutes an ancient and sacred shrine, but is not a major center of their habitation. 

Custody of the site is granted to an evil high priest of Kauket known as the Great Tongue, currently a certain Reepsiq (10-47). The Great Tongue is served by several other high-level spell casters and a mixed group of heqeti hoppers, chosen, and builders. Lesser heqeti sometimes make a pilgrimage from their dwellings in the Underearth to the ziggurat. To serve these pilgrims, the Great Tongue has constructed a small complex of ‘public’ areas (areas 10-51 to 10-62). Human and demi-human intruders arriving from Level 9 (via 10-1 or 10-31) will be instantly and unquestioningly treated as foes by the heqeti. Only those arriving from the Underearth (10-62) might find a cautiously neutral reception.

Given the concentration of powerful heqeti here, the task of cleansing the area of its evil is challenging. Most PCs will approach Level 10 through the heqeti forward post on Level 9 (areas 9-76 to 9-82). If the heqeti manage to send a warning from that location (see 9-79) to Level 10, then the Great Tongue and his forces will be prepared and waiting for intruders. Their state of readiness lasts for twelve hours; after twelve hours, the Great Tongue sends a strong party of heqeti hoppers, chosen, weavers, and builders up the long passage from 10-1 to 9-82 so as to reoccupy their forward base.

While the heqeti forces are on alert, the leaders will all be found in and around the ziggurat (10-32 to 10-37), ready for a titanic battle. If the heqeti are not alerted, then they are dispersed throughout the level. Exterminating the heqeti and cleansing the ziggurat of its 
evil (see text at 10-32 to 10-37), ends the heqeti presence in Arden Vul ... at least for a generation. For, like all evil, the heqeti will eventually return, seeking to re-sanctify their holy site and again move into the other portions of Arden Vul. The only way to end the heqeti interest in the area is to destroy the ziggurat completely, e.g., by using powerful magic (earthquake, limited wish, etc.).

General Construction Notes
* Heqeti areas: All worked areas are heqeti areas

Iconic Areas
* The Ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-37)

Important NPCs
* Reepsiq, the heqeti Great Tongue (10-47)

Factions
* The heqeti fully control the entire level.

Environment 
* The Mephitic Marsh (10-15) makes the entire level humid and warm. The marsh itself smells powerfully of acid, decay, and sulphur.
* The ziggurat proper (areas 10-32 to 10-37) lies under a hallow spell (see new spells) with a 60’ radius. This effect provides a +2 bonus to all rolls (saves, ‘to hit’ rolls, etc.) for those of CE alignment, while imposing a penalty of -2 to all rolls on those of all other alignments.  The surrounding chambers and corridors lack this effect.

The Heqeti and Kauket

For generations, heqeti Great Tongues have been attempting to summon Kauket himself to aid them in their goal of reoccupying the rest of Arden Vul. They have failed, mostly because of the absence of the pale green, spiral horn necessary to complete the summoning within the ziggurat (10-37). The horn was taken by the rudishva when they defeated the heqeti in antiquity; it is currently located in a high-security rudishva vault (area 5-95A). Knowledge of the very existence of the horn is limited, even to the heqeti. Reepsiq is aware that his efforts to summon Kauket will continue to fail until a horn is restored to area 10-37, but he doesn’t 
know exactly what the missing horn looks like.

The best information on the nature and location of the pale green horn is actually held by the two rudishva AIs, RAJ-750 (6-27) and AKL-600 (SL14-13); only the AIs can provide the proper command code to access the teleporter that leads to the secret vault. Should the PCs locate the horn and learn of its proper use, they will be able to insert it in the proper place in 10-37. Doing so instantly summons Kauket, however!

GMs must carefully consider whether combat with such a powerful foe is desirable and/or necessary for their campaigns. For certain campaigns, a battle with a demon prince might be an appropriate conclusion. For others, however, such a foolish and almost certainly lethal confrontation might not be appropriate. If such a confrontation is desired, the GM should seed information about the existence of the pale green horn so as to allow the PCs to bring Kauket to this plane. For such foolhardy PCs, Kauket is fully statted in the new monsters appendix. Of course, the demon prince will bring appropriate servitors with him to the Prime 

Material Plane, including multiple keqemandri and other lesser demons. Forewarned is forearmed! If a GM deems combat with a demon prince to be inappropriate for his/her campaign, however, it is easy enough to occlude the existence of the horn; in such cases, 
combat with the Great Tongue and the cleansing of the ziggurat will easily serve as a satisfying culmination to the campaign.

Weakening the Heqeti

Accomplishing certain tasks elsewhere in the Halls may make the task of cleansing the ziggurat slightly easier. Of course, knowledge of how to weaken the heqeti is not common within Arden Vul. Should canny PCs seek information on how to do so, the GM ought to make the acquisition of this knowledge a quest in and of itself, one that would probably involve visiting imperial sages and archives in Archontos or communing with good-aligned deities. Some PCs may accomplish one or more of these tasks without realizing their import; if they do, so much the better for them. 

* Removing the evil hallow effect (see new spells) from the upper heqeti temple. 
	* 7-78
	* Strips the magical power from the statues on the third step of the ziggurat of Kauket (10-34); the statues will not be able to utter unholy words at the Great Tongue's command
* Weakening Rimmaq-Isfet by poisoning him through the portal in the Feasting Hall
	* 8-76
	* Removes the evil hallow (see new spells) effect that covers the ziggurat of Kauket (see introductory text for areas 10-32 to 10-37)
* Destroying the giant statue of Kauket, or neutralizing its power by casting a good-aligned hallow spell on it (see new spells)
	* 9-12
	* Weakens Kauket himself, should the demon prince be summoned to this plane (see below and area 10-37 for this process). Kauket's magic resistance is reduced by 25% (from 80% to 55%)

## Level 10: 1 - 15

### 10-1: Heqeti Road Up to 9-82

Serving as the primary connection between the ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-37) and the rest of Arden Vul, this broad corridor is eerily lit by fungal pods that hang every 20’ or so. The pods emit a green luminescence that reflects gently off the oiled, pebbled stonework of the road. The corridor is 20’ tall and very long, extending about 300’ between 9-82 and 10-2. Every 60’ or so, it ascends up a flight of steps with a rise-to-tread ratio too large for human feet.

About every 40’ the road is flanked by a pair of alcoves. The majority of the alcoves contain shapeless, damaged lumps of stone that once might have been statues. The last four niches before the road reaches area 10-1, however, have new, recognizable statues formed of granite brought from the Underearth. They depict four contemporary leaders who are leading the heqeti resurgence in Arden Vul: Caudatssa the Tongue (7-79), Reepsiq the Great Tongue (10-47), Pikaressa the Second Tongue (10-49), and Qassapik the Weaver (10-48). All four appear in classically aggressive heqeti poses, in slight crouches and wielding a staff or wand.

### 10-2: Hall of Mouths

When approached from the west, an eerie green glow can be seen emerging from this 25’-tall chamber. The glow comes from the green luminescence emitted by scores of fungal pods that hang from pegs on the walls and from the ceiling (the pods are harvested from the swamp in 10-15). The walls are also covered with purple lichen and yellow shelf fungus. The hall is dominated by a large abstract sculpture rising from the center of a murky pool of greenish water. The sculpture (once a statue of Kauket, but damaged in antiquity and now unrecognizable) is festooned with dripping algae. Numerous warning salamanders (see new 
monsters) writhe in the pool and among the algae. The presence of non-heqeti causes them to strobe and to dart in all directions, both into the pool but also towards 10-5, 10-10, and 10-14. 

All but one of the exits from the hall are carved to resemble enormous, toothed salamander mouths. The carvings are incredibly ancient, and badly damaged; indeed, the lower teeth in 
all of the portals were smashed in antiquity. Still, they present a foreboding aspect, one that is compounded by the rippling, green-and-black shell strings that block sight into each mouth.

A patch of heqeti sign mold (see new flora) is found on the wall to the right side of each of mouth. When approached within 5’ the mold adjusts itself to reveal an image and a phrase in Heqeti Runic. Amid the other fungi and luminescent pods, it might be possible for hasty explorers to miss the sign mold: the mold should thus be treated as a concealed doors.

Destination Image Phrase
To 10-4 Spear Faithful // Watchers
To 10-10 Eft Water // Life
To 10-14 Ziggurat Tongue// sacrifice // Kauket 
To 10-5 Flask Weavers // Rimmaq-Isfet
To 10-3 Spear Faithful // Watchers

If the heqeti have been warned of approaching hostile forces (see 9-79), then the forces from areas 10-3 and 10-4 will have an ambush waiting in this chamber. They will also have summoned aid from area 10-6 and will have released the neo-otyugh from 10-5. These reinforcements wait just inside the tunnel to 10-5 hoping to surprise intruders once they engage with the initial heqeti forces. 

8 warning salamanders (see new monsters): SZ S; AC 8; MV 90’, 150’ swimming; HD 2; HP 14, 13, 12, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8; #AT 0; Dmg 0. Special attacks: strobe light. Special defenses: surprised only on 1.

Treasure:
The shells that form the curtains hanging in the mouths are rare, and could bring 900 gp total.

### 10-3: Heqeti Watchers

One of two teams of heqeti guardians keeps watch on the approaches to the ziggurat from this chamber. The walls are painted a sickly mauve and are covered with more of the yellow 
shelf fungus; the floor is painted black, although it is punctuated with a dozen, large, white teardrops. The team consists of six heqeti chosen led by a heqeti weaver (see new monsters). They possess the bloated, stinking corpses of a baindara and a varumani, which they use for target practice with their spears.

The heqeti react immediately to the presence of intruders in area 10-2. Should they be forewarned of the arrival of hostile forces, one of the chosen will have been sent to 10-14 to warn the Great Tongue; the remainder will prepare an ambush (in conjunction with their fellows in 10-4).

6 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 44, 41, 40, 39, 37, 35; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice.

### 10-4: More Heqeti Watchers

* This chamber is decorated identically to 10-3, and contains an equivalent force of guardians.
	* They have no rotting corpses, but do possesses a primitive soapstone statue of Kauket, to which they  has attached numerous bits of flesh taken from foes (450 gp).

6 heqeti chosen (see new monsters): see stats at area 10-3.

1 heqeti weaver (see new monsters): see stats at area 10-3.

### 10-5: Ancient Hole

The corridor is badly damaged here, with a mini cave-in on the northeast side and numerous ancient blast marks along the walls. More significant is the crater that blocks access down the corridor; it is 25’ deep but only 20’ wide. A rickety bridge of reeds, vines, and fungal fibers spans the hole, anchored to the walls on either side of the hole. On either side of the bridge is an upturned giant mushroom cap containing a pile of rotting viscera from unknown creatures. On the south side of the hole is a pile of ropes woven from the same mix of vines and reeds; the heqeti use it to pull the neo-otyugh from the hole if necessary.

The hole is inhabited by a large neo-otyugh. The heqeti feed it scraps from sacrifices and other victims. Given sufficient warning, the heqeti in 10-3 and 10-4 use the ropes to haul the neo-otyugh out of the hole to aid them in repelling intruders. The bottom of the hole is covered with several feet of biological rubbish, including skins, bones, bits of leather equipment, and so forth. Amid the debris are four heqeti stone spear-heads, three barbed 
heqeti arrows coated in Kauket’s vision (see Arden Vul items), and a bardiche +1, +4 vs heqeti.

1 neo-otyugh: SZ L; AL N; AC 0; MV 60’; HD 11; HP 71; #AT 3; Dmg 2-12/2-12/1-3. Special attacks: disease. Special defenses: never surprised.

### 10-6: Crossroads Encampment

A contingent of heqeti hoppers under the command of a lesser builder are stationed in this badly damaged crossroads. The northern side of the intersection is badly damaged, with the 
pebbled, oily stonework giving way to rough natural granite. The heqeti are working here to try to uncover some of the lost areas to the west and south, and have recently broken through to area 10-8. 

The encampment includes three baskets woven of vines, a portable bathing pool composed of a 10’x4’ carapace of some underground creature, and numerous digging tools (mattocks, 
sledges, shovels). The baskets hold dried fish, dried mushrooms, and dried sausage.

10 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 31, 30, 28, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 
(bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. 

1 heqeti builder (see new monsters), 6th/6th-level fighter/cleric of Rimmaq-Isfet: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 90’, 120’ swimming; HD 6; HP 46; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (short sword +2 of wounding). Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: heqeti mail armor (-2 to AC); short sword +2 of wounding, amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items). Spells: bless, command, cure light wounds, light, fear; chant, hold person (x2), silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic, curse.

### 10-7: Broken Lesser Obsidian Gates

* A pair of large, obsidian valves (similar to the iconic ones of 5-6, though much smaller) lie shattered on the floor here.
	* Beyond is a completely collapsed corridor that once led to a major shrine to Rimmaq-Isfet. It was cleansed by the Archonteans in antiquity, and the access route to it collapsed.
		* The heqeti have begun the slow process digging back to the shrine.
		* GM Note: The lost shrine provides a possibility for GM expansion.

### 10-8: Heqeti Shrine 

This chamber superficially resembles area 9-121. The ceiling is 25’ tall and is supported by a row of 4’-diameter pillars that flank the north and south walls. Originally the pillars marched down the corridor towards 10-6, but only one of these remains. Notable features include three grotesque stone faces carved into three of the pillars, an enormous sculpture in the center, and an unsettling carved block of arcanum at the west end. 

Stone Pillar Faces: The three pillars at the east edge of the room are carved as grotesque stone faces (like those at areas 6-92 and 9-121). Each head is roughly humanoid, but contains some unusual amphibian-oid features, including bulbous eyes, slit noses and 
lolling tongues. The mouth of each head/face is open, revealing a 2’ oval compartment. If a flask-full of the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items) is placed in any of the mouths, the tongue of that head will lick the nearest person (within 5’). Two effects are imparted: 1) the subject will be immune to acid effects from any of the servitors of Kauket (such as keqemandri – see new monsters) for 5-10 turns, and 2) the subject will be afflicted with an effect from the following table:

D10 Effect
1 Sweat uncontrollably for 7 days, -3 CHA, -1 to hit rolls
2 Temporary gills, allowing subject to breathe underwater, for 7 days
3 Eyes grow disproportionately large, -1 CHA but true seeing, for 3 days
4 Legs grow in power, arms atrophy: MV increased by 30’, STR -1, for 3 days
5 Webbing between fingers and toes, better swimming but -1 CHA
6 Comprehend amphibian tongues, for 7 days
7 Cursed (if good), blessed for 3 days if CE, nothing for other alignments
8 Sensitive to light for 7 days (-2 to all rolls), but gains infravision
9 Locate body of fresh water; knows route to pool-sized bodies of water (or larger) within 200’
10 Mark of Kauket: all 9 of the above, the effects of 1-3 of which are permanent

Remove curse will remove any of the temporary effects, but the Mark of Kauket can only be removed through the special favor of a good-aligned deity (probably at the cost of a significant quest).

Sculpture of Rimmaq-Isfet: Dominating the center of the chamber is a giant soapstone representation of Rimmaq-Isfet. It is easily 40’ long, 10’ tall and 10’ wide, and depicts the dread lord as an enormous, slug-like amphibian. The thick body rests on eight salamander-like legs, while the open maw points towards the altar at the west. A forest of delicate feelers originally extended out of the toothed maw, and a ridge of 5’ tentacles extended in a circle 
around the mouth; these were all broken off in antiquity, and lie in pieces on the floor. Sharp teeth still line the mouth, however, and three huge lidless eyes span its brow. The eyes once held gems, but they were stolen in antiquity. The entire statue is painted black, with yellow spots.

The other feature of the sculpture is that it oozes an oily clear liquid that drips to the floor and pools in a subtle depression (10’ in diameter) to the south of the sculpture. This sweat is none other than the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items). Currently seven flasks-full of the sweat exist in the depression; the sculpture oozes enough to produce one flask per day. 

Arcanum Teleport Mouth: The west wall features a low dais (3’ tall), upon which is a squat, foreboding block of orange arcanum (see new magic items) roughly 8’ square. The arcanum is carved as an open, upturned mouth and is meant to depict the open maw of Rimmaq-Isfet. The opening of the mouth is about 5’ in diameter and extends 3’ down from the top of the mouth. The rest of the block is quite detailed, with feelers, teeth, and two pronounced, 6’-
long orbital ridges along either side of the mouth. Each ridge used to have three empty sockets where eyes might have been; they are perfectly sized for tears of Kauket (see new magic items). One of the ridges was vandalized in antiquity, however, and its three eye sockets are ruined and misshapen. The entire mouth rests on four 3’-diameter cylinders of granite, each of which is carved to depict the head of an enemy of the heqeti in agony: these are a human, a varumani, a rudishva, and a varuda. Finally, a set of slots are carved into the east face of the block; these can be used to climb to its top.

Four 7’ iron rods are thrust into the top of the arcanum block, and a pitiful true varumani named Bedara is suspended between the four rods. Beaten, tortured, and gagged, she has six copper ritual daggers buried in her flesh; these open wounds are preventing full regeneration, and cause her blood to drip into the arcanum maw. Although badly injured, she could be rescued and, after regenerating, will eagerly accompany and assist her saviors.

The block of arcanum is, of course, highly magical, and detects easily as such. The mouth functioned as an outgoing teleportal to other heqeti sites within Arden Vul. It works by climbing the arcanum block, placing a tear of Kauket (see new magic items) into an appropriate eye socket, and then jumping into the open mouth. Ten seconds later the user appears in the desired location. 

As one of the orbital ridges has been vandalized, only three of the eye sockets are still operative. Of these, the right eye sends the user to area 6-104 while the center eye sends the user to area 7-84. The destination for the left eye was destroyed in antiquity (it formerly abutted area SL5-32); attempting to use it causes instant death as the user is teleported into solid rock. The heqeti have filled the left eye socket with mud to prevent any further ‘disappearances’. The tears of Kauket (see new magic items) used to power the teleporter are consumed in the process.

GM Note: The heqeti have only recently dug their way back to this shrine. Reepsiq (10-47) and the other heqeti leaders were delighted to find the chamber, as they hoped to use its teleport powers to return to the upper levels. Their plans were thwarted by the fact that only two of the original six teleportals still functioned (three were destroyed in antiquity and the fourth sends explorers to their doom). These limitations explain the minimal presence of heqeti outside levels 9 and 10. Should the GM wish it, he/she might decide that the heqeti will shortly repair more of the teleportals on the arcanum block; those other teleportals lead to areas 5-41, SL6-6, and 8-162. Once/if those other destinations are accessible, the heqeti will swiftly move to establish fortified advance positions in each of those areas.

Bedara, a true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 11 (max 55); #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or by weapon. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Bedara is a senior and popular member of the varumani lodge of hunters 
(see 7-14); she was ambushed and captured while scouting the aroksachaul (see new monsters) on Level 9. The other hunters (and especially Nolgi) will be eternally grateful to her rescuers.

### 10-9: Broken Corridor Fragment

* This section of corridor is badly damaged; fully blocked by the destruction wrought in antiquity.
* Secret Door (east): magically held. 

### 10-10: Heqeti Eft Ponds

Despite the ruined nature of its western side, this 20’-tall hall is still in use by the heqeti. It is warmer and more humid than surrounding areas, and subtly lit by more of the green, luminescent pods that hang on the walls. Originally six oval ponds flanked a larger central pool, but the western three ponds were destroyed in antiquity. The three surviving ponds are shallow (3’ deep) and filled with murky, brownish, algae-clouded water taken from the mephitic marsh (area 10-15). The central pool, however, is deeper (7’) and filled with clear water that recirculates through six huge tusks that project from the pool’s rim. The heqeti use the area for mating (central pool) and the maturation of efts (side ponds). 

Currently there are seventeen non-combatant efts in the side pods, while four heqeti chosen stand guard. The sound of combat here brings Feqarrip from area 10-11 to investigate.

17 heqeti efts (non-combatants): SZ S; AC 8, HP 2.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8 (spear +1), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: spear +1.

Treasure:
One of the eft ponds contains a ring of acid resistance (see new magic items) hidden in the murk.

### 10-11: Abattoir

Although a dais and the stump of a statue are visible by the north wall, the heqeti have repurposed this area for food storage and preparation. A score of carcasses hang from hooks in the ceiling; they are in various state of draining and/or curing. Two are still 
alive, moreover. A stone table rests against the southeastern wall; a half-dozen sharp copper blades rest on its blood-soaked surface.  Feqarrip, an heqeti weaver responsible for the care and feeding of the efts, lurks among the hanging corpses. She is quick to join combat in area 10-10.


Feqarrip, a heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 7th/7th-level magic user/cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 7; HP 35; #AT 1; Dmg 5-9 (hammer +2). 
Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items); hammer +2; potion of gaseous form. Memorized spells: enlarge, jump, magic missile, shield; continual 
light, levitate, ray of enfeeblement; fireball, protection from normal missiles; polymorph other. Cleric spells prayed for: bless, command (x2), create water, cure light wounds; chant, hold person (x2), resist fire, silence 15’ radius; animate dead, blindness; sticks to snakes. Spell 
book: dancing lights, detect magic, enlarge, jump, magic missile, protection from good, read magic, shield, sleep; darkness 15’ radius, invisibility, knock, mirror image, ray of enfeeblement, strength; blink, dispel magic, gust of wind, lightning bolt, slow.

Mox, a lesser varumani (see new monsters), gagged and hanging trussed from a hook: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 10 (max 51); #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or by weapon. 
Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.

Erenbald, 6th-level male Thorcin ranger, hanging trussed from a hook (and missing three fingers and five toes): SZ M; AL CG; AC 10; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 4 (max 58); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 16, INT 13, WIS 14, DEX 10, CON 17, CHA 11. Erenbald has no equipment. 

GM Note: Erenbald and two companions were exploring level 7 with Mox as a guide; the group discovered area 7-84 but were overwhelmed by the heqeti nearby. Although his companions were sacrificed in the temple at 7-79, Erenbald and Mox were delivered to level 10 for interrogation and eventually were designated as food for the efts. 

### 10-12: Magic Nexus

A dangerous magical hot spot persists here, where the ancient corridors were destroyed in antiquity. Caused by the unwelcome confluence of Archontean destructive magic with the local heqeti demonic and divine magic, the hot spot inflicts a variety of unpleasant effects on those who come too close. The hot spot is difficult to note, appearing only as a shimmer in the (darkened) corridor. Magic users have a 1 in 6 chance to passively detect the danger, while thieves have a 1 in 8 chance. Searching carefully, of course, reveals the shimmer instantly. Those who blunder into the hot spot must roll on the following table to determine the effect:

D10 Effect
1

Electrostatic Charge: victim takes 2-16 HP electric damage, hair turns bone white and stands straight up. 

2

Magnetism: victim’s skin is magnetized, causing all iron-based objects within 2’ to adhere to his/her skin. It takes a successful open doors check to pull the item(s) free. Combat with iron/steel weapons is impossible

3

Narcolepsy: tension and conflict produce in the victim an impulse to sleep. At the start 
of any stressful endeavor, the victim must save vs spells or fall asleep for 1-4 rounds. 

4

Magic Magnet: victim is attuned to magic, such that magic user spells cast at others are likely to target him/her instead. For every spell cast at a person or object within 30’ of the victim, the victim must save vs spells or take the effects on him/herself. Note: this might aid 
a party, but might also hinder it.

5

Light Master: the victim possesses infravision and ultravision to 60’. Unfortunately, he/she also emits a bright purple glow, rendering him/her visible at 150’.

6

Phase Distortion: victim continuously comes in and out of phase. This acts as a blur spell on him/her in combat, but also causes permanent balance and dexterity issues; for non-combat purposes, the victim’s DEX is reduced by 3, as the victim has trouble knowing where to put his/her feet.

7

Echo Effect: victim’s hearing is badly damaged. Listen rolls are reduced by 3-12%. This may render some races effectively deaf.

8

Monster Magnet: victim doubles chances for wandering monsters.

GM Note: the persistence of these weird effects explains the heqeti reticence to re-delve these collapsed areas. As these are not exactly curses, they cannot dispelled by remove curse. The GM might decree that dispel magic cast by a 12th- or higher-level caster might remove the effect.

### 10-13: Quarters of Cheksib the Weaver

This spacious hall has been repurposed as the residence of Cheksib the weaver, one of the Great Tongue’s (10-47) chief lieutenants. The hall is 15’ tall, and and the walls are painted inky black, with yellow spots dotting the darkness.

A low, stone-rimmed pool is attached to the north wall of the chamber; it is murky and contains small fish, amphibians, lichen, and water plants. To the south of the pool are two oval lounging devices; they appear as 5’-long, empty peapods sloped such that the head is about 3’ higher than the foot of the lounger. Cheksib and a guest can rest in the pods, while letting their feet dangle in the water of the pool. By the south wall are two stone sleeping 
benches, a locked stone chest, and two woven baskets containing dried fish and eels (25 lb per basket).

Cheksib is present in his quarters unless the complex has been alerted to the potential arrival of intruders (see Level 10 introduction). If an alert has been raised, Cheksib will be present at area 10-17, attempting to summon a worm of Qok (see new monsters).

Trap (chest): A glyph of warding in the form of energy drain was cast on the chest by the Great Tongue. The glyph drains one level of experience from its victim. 

Cheksib, a heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 12th-level cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 12; HP 83; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10 (footman’s mace +2). 
Constant abilities: infravision; WIS 18 for bonus spells. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items); copper-headed mace +2; a heqeti ring (see new magic items); and a rod of absorption (25 spell levels). Cleric spells: bless, cause fear, command (x2), create water, cure light wounds, light, resist cold; augury, chant, hold person (x2), resist fire, silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; animate dead, blindness, dispel magic (x2), prayer, speak with dead; cause serious wounds, divination, neutralize poison, protection from good 10’ radius; flame strike, true seeing; aerial servant, heal.

Treasure:
The chest contains 9,513 gp in assorted types of coins, plus three pure white and three particolored tears of Kauket (see new magic items), two vials of Kauket’s vision (see Arden Vul items), two heqeti spore bombs (see Arden Vul items), a pledge of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items), and a set of six sacrificial knives made of copper (1,500 gp for the set). The handles of the knives are carved to resemble salamander-monsters whose eyes are filled with lapis lazuli.

### 10-14: Broken Obsidian Gates 

* Smaller cousins of the famous Obsidian Gates (see area 5-6) once stood here, blocking the main route to the Mephitic Marsh (10-15) from the west.
	* The valves were blasted apart by the rudishva in antiquity, leaving 2’-wide stumps that still swing easily on their hinges.
		* Hanging from each fragment are roughly a dozen heads of sentient creatures, in varying states of decay.  Most are skeletal, but there are a few still with flesh: an aroksachaul (new), a goblin, and a human.

### 10-15: The Mephitic Marsh

This enormous cavern is home to the infamous ziggurat of Kauket (see 10-32 to 10-37). It is warm, humid, and dimly lit by green and yellow phosphorescent lichen and algae. The ziggurat and other worked structures rise from a deep, smelly marsh that roils and burps from geothermal forces. The cavern is about 90’ tall, but the bottom 20’ is a soggy mixture of wet humus, nitrogenated water in ponds and rivulets, and decaying biological matter. It smells powerfully of acid, decay, and sulphur.

Flora and Fauna of the Marsh: The marsh has a wide variety of plant life, including dozens of species of mushrooms, lichens, and algae. Two unusual types of flora dominate, however: a fruticose, aquatic version of wolf lichen known to the heqeti as acid drops (see new flora), and a variety of brown algae known as the glowing friend (see new flora). The former is slightly dangerous, for it contains an acid that is toxic to mammals. The pneumocysts of the 
latter allow it to float gently in the humid air; those sacs are also phosphorescent, providing the dim light that marks the marsh.

Scores of species of insects inhabit the swamp; these range in size from finger-nail sized skimmers to fist-sized dragonflies and spiders. Some blind cave fish inhabit the larger ponds. The largest, and most dangerous animals of the swamp, however, are the acid salamanders (see new monsters) that prey on the smaller creatures. For every turn spent in the marsh, there is a 1 in 6 chance of attracting 2-4 of these voracious creatures.

Movement in the Marsh: The surface of the marsh is and wet and swampy, with multiple pools and rivulets of brown water. Since it is often hard to find drier ground amid the lichen, algae, and water, movement is effectively halved here. It is possible to move at 3/4 speed, but so doing requires a save versus poison each round; failure indicates that some of the toxic sap of the acid drops has affected the PC (take 2-5 HP damage).

16 acid salamanders (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’, 90’ swimming; HD 7; HP 53, 52, 50, 49, 49, 48, 48, 47(x3), 46, 46, 45, 45, 44, 44; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: acid spit. Special defenses: immune to acid.

## Level 10: 16- 31

### 10-16: Least Causeway

Rising only 5’ above the level of the marsh, this causeway is the lowest of the three connecting to the ziggurat of Kauket (see 10-32). Short staircases provide access into the marsh on either side; in addition, numerous small (2’-diameter) holes drilled through the causeway allow water and creatures to move back and forth from the north and south sides of the marsh. The portion of the causeway closest to the ziggurat was badly damaged in both the rudishva and Archontean wars. The more intact, western portion is lined with 4’-tall iron stakes upon which hang the decomposing corpses of various sacrificial victims – human, goblin, varumani, etc.

If the heqeti are alerted to the arrival of the PCs, a welcoming party of builders, hoppers and chosen will be waiting on the causeway and in the nearby marsh, hoping to slow the intruders’ progress towards the ziggurat.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 44, 41, 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8 (spear +1), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: spear +1.

8 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 29, 28, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 18; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

2 heqeti builders (see new monsters), 6th/6th-level fighter/clerics of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 90’, 120’ swimming; HD 6; HP 46, 44; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (short sword +2 of wounding). 
Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: heqeti mail armor (-2 to AC); short sword +2 of wounding, amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items). Spells: bless, command, cure light wounds, light, 
fear; chant, hold person (x2), silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic, curse.

### 10-17: Lower Summoning Platform

Rising 35’ above the surrounding marsh, this flattened stone pillar is home to an oval pool of murky, viscous brown sludge some 10’x3’ in size. Four slim columns of polished basalt stand around the pool, one on each side; these 4’-tall columns are set obliquely (not perpendicular to the floor). When a sacrificial victim has been tied to the four columns and the proper summoning rites performed, a worm of Qok (see new monsters) appears in the pool, eager to devour whatever sacrifices are forthcoming.

If the heqeti are forewarned about intruders on level 10, then one of the prisoners from 10-43 (determined randomly) will be tied to the columns while Cheksib the weaver summons a worm of Qok. In a battle royale in 10-15 or upon the ziggurat, the worm of Qok will first attempt to attack PCs in the northern half of the marsh; if none are present there, it mounts the least causeway (10-16) and then moves to the ziggurat (10-32) to defend the fane of its lord. Cheksib, meanwhile, uses spells in support of the Great Tongue. If PCs are able to enter the great cavern without alerting the ziggurat or heqeti leaders, then of course the platform will be empty.

1 worm of Qok (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 12; HP 86; #AT 1; Dmg 2-24; MR 50%. Special attacks: swallow.

Cheksib the heqeti weaver, (see new monsters): see stats at area 10-13

Prisoner from 10-43, to be determined randomly.

### 10-18: Upper Summoning Platform 

* Rising 55’ from the marsh, this flattened stone pillar is identical to the one at 10-17.
	* Alarm Raised: the heqeti weaver, Neepariq, will be present here, sacrificing a random victim from 10-43 in order to summon a worm of Qok.
	* No Alarm: the platform is empty.
* A long, slender, and steep staircase descends from this platform to the marsh.

1 worm of Qok (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 12; HP 86; #AT 1; Dmg 2-24; MR 50%. Special attacks: swallow.

Neepariq, heqeti weaver, as 12th-level cleric of Kauket (see 10-40)

Prisoner from 10-43, to be determined randomly.

### 10-19: High Bridge

* Soaring 55’ above the marsh, this 10’-wide, 3’-thick, damaged stone bridge connects 10-18 with the top level of the Ziggurat (10-35).
	* One section of the span was broken in antiquity; now spanned by rickety wooden planks.

### 10-20: Pilgrim’s Rest

The largest structure in the great cavern outside of the ziggurat, this platform is the site at which many heqeti pilgrims stop to take in the sights and make a small offering to Kauket. The platform rises 25’ above the marsh, and was damaged in the wars of antiquity. It is connected to the ziggurat by a bridge (10-21) and to the eastern chambers by a solid causeway. The center of the platform has a low, raised pool about 18’ in diameter. To either side of the pool are two 

4’-tall copper statues of erect salamanders with upturned mouths. Heqeti devotees of Kauket approach the pool, perform ablutions there, and deposit offerings of small gems into the mouths of the salamanders. Once this is accomplished, they are free to enter the ziggurat. The offering statues are periodically emptied into the treasury (10-53).

Unalerted: The platform is watched by a quartet of heqeti chosen (see new monsters) with long halberds. At any given moment 5-8 heqeti pilgrims are present on the platform.

Alerted: If alerted, 2 heqeti builders, 2 apprentices, and 10 hoppers guard the causeway.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-12 (halberd +1), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: halberd +1.

fear; chant, hold person (x2), silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic, curse.

10 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 5th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 5; HP 38, 36, 36, 35, 35, 34, 33, 32, 32, 30; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 
(bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: club +1; heqeti spore bomb (see Arden Vul items). Spells prayed for: bless, command, cure light wounds, darkness, detect magic; chant, hold person, resist fire, silence 15’ radius.

Treasure:
The copper statues are worth 300 gp each. They contain a total of 37 gems worth 50 gp each and 319 gems worth 10gp each.

### 10-21: Low Bridge

* This 20’-wide, 5’-thick bridge rises 25' above the Mephitic marsh, in relatively good shape.
	* It connects the 2nd level of the ziggurat (10-33) with the nearby pilgrims’ rest area (10-20).

### 10-22: Stair Fragment 

* A fragment of staircase that once connected to 10-20 rises from the marsh.
	* Solid stone and 10’ tall, liberally covered with acid drops and the glowing friend (flora).
	* It is a good location from which observe the ziggurat.

### 10-23: Pillar with Ledges 

* A pillar of stone rises to the ceiling here.
	* Two ledges are inset at a point 15’ above the marsh.
	* The flora has been carefully pruned back here to allow the heqeti to admire the ziggurat.
		* The northern ledge provides good sight lines overlooking the first step of the east face of the ziggurat.
	* Numerous heqeti sigils are carved into the side of the pillar. 
### 10-24: Platform of the Pukel

* A broad, low stone platform rises 5’ above the level of the marsh.
	* The pavement is cracked, pitted, and holed, abutting the great salamander head to the south (10-25).
	* This is the destination for all the heqeti teleport wells throughout Arden Vul, currently active or inoperative (i.e., 4-74, 6-106, 7-83, 8-25, 8-162, and SL5-32).

### 10-25: Giant Salamander Head

A giant, carved, stone salamander head rises ominously from the Mephitic Marsh at this point. It resembles both the Great Pukel (9-40) and the colossal buried head (9-12) in appearance: the head is rounded, with no ears, huge saucer-shaped eyes, a slit nose, and a gaping maw some 10’ in size. The lower lip juts forward from the mouth, allowing liquid to drip from the head and upper lip into the open maw. The maw is filled with clear water, amid which glisten numerous pure white tears of Kauket (see new magic items). The head rises 25’ above the marsh, and its mouth is level with the nearby platform (10-24). 

The head is an extrusion of both Kauket and Rimmaq-Isfet on this plane; it continuously oozes a viscous white liquid that drips into the water of the head’s maw, where it turns into a tear of Kauket. 

The head produces sufficient liquid for five tears of Kauket each day, up to a maximum of 15 tears. If collected and drunk before it can harden into a tear, the liquid causes permanent madness.

Treasure:
Nine tears of Kauket (see new magic items).

### 10-26: Pillar with Ledge 

* Another natural pillar rises from floor to ceiling in here.
	* A small ledge is set into the pillar 10’ above the level of the marsh.
		* The ledge contains a battered memorial to the legionaries of the Archontean 10th Legion (“the Glorious Tenth”), a copper casket within a stone cairn.
			* Though corroded, the casket still bears the legion's distinctive numeral X (10).
				* Within: a gladius +2, a cestus, a copper plaque, a scroll (Kentillian’s useful sphere, new), and an amulet of courage (see new magic items).
					* The plaque reads (Mithric) “In memory of our brothers and sisters in the Glorious Tenth, who died to cleanse this foul site.” (2,500 gp to the modern polemarch of the legion).
	* Pillar and ledge are heavily swathed in both the glowing friend and acid drops (flora).

### 10-27: Vantage Point 

* This broad platform set into the south wall of the cavern is 35’ above the level of the marsh.
	* It provides a fine view of the ziggurat, looming to the north.
	* A narrow set of stairs provides access to the marsh.
	* Once a gathering place for pilgrims in antiquity, the damage to the western precincts of the heqeti complex has left this area relatively unvisited.
	* Secret Door (south): opens simply by pushing inward.

### 10-28: Cistern

* The heqeti have walled off this portion of the great cavern with mortared round stones.
	* The run-off of the Rimpled Run (10-30 and 10-31) collects into this large cistern, which The heqeti use the cistern to modulate the amount of water in the Mephitic Marsh.
		* The retaining wall of the cistern is 10’ thick and 30’ tall; its top is flattened, allowing persons to walk along the top.
		* The water level is 15’ from the floor of the cavern. 
	* A sluice gate set into the retaining wall allows addition of water to the marsh.
		* The controls are atop the retaining wall; a simple wheel lever attached to a rope.
		* Given the size of the marsh, emptying the cistern does not seriously affect movement or the structures in the marsh.

### 10-29: Cistern Keepers’ Post

* 2 heqeti hoppers are stationed in this hidden perch overlooking the mephitic marsh (10-15).
	* They maintain the cistern (10-28) and watching the river and spillway (10-30).
	* They have a rope ladder attached to eyebolts set in the floor to descend to the cistern.
	* They sound the alarm with a spiral ibex horn in case of attack or if they spot intruders in the cistern.
	* The west wall is painted black, with a sinuous white tongue superimposed over it (a symbol of Rimmaq-Isfet).
* The post offers a fine vantage point from which to observe the ziggurat.
	* 1-4 hours spying can learn quite a bit about the heqeti population and activities.

2 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 24, 22; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to 
damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

### 10-30: Beach and Spillway

* A broad cave spans the Rimpled Run here.
	* The cave slopes down gently from south to north, making the northern bank a spillway for excess water from the Run.
		* Ordinarily the overflow is only to a small trickle that drips down the cliff into 10-28. Significant changes to the water flow (see 9-65) cause the trickle to grow to a flood, affecting the water level at 10-28.
	* A limed over ring of swimming is encrusted into the stone along the south bank of the Rimpled Run (detect as secret door).
* Secret Door (west): opens by pushing it open (open doors).

### 10-31: Rimpled Run, from 9-141

* The Rimpled Run emerges from level 9 (9-141) here.
	* That section of the underground river is vigorous and dangerous, entirely water-filled (see 9-141 for risks of traveling from that location).
	* Those who navigate the Run find that it slows considerably in this section, allowing swimmers a chance to exit the river at 10-30 (3d6 under DEX to reach the beach).
	* The Rimpled Run continues for several miles before debouching into the Silent Sea, a vast underground lake forming a key portion of the Underearth.

## Level 10: 10-32 - 10-37 (The Ziggurat of Kauket)

The ziggurat of Kauket is the dominant feature of Level 10. The ziggurat is massive and ancient. First built out of huge blocks of granite some 3,400 years ago, it has always served as a site for heqeti worship of the demon prince, Kauket. The blocks are 10’x15’ in size, and are pitted, pebbled, and greasy from the blood of sacrifices and the passage of countless heqeti slimes. As the map makes clear, the ziggurat has been damaged over the millennia, 
particularly on its lower steps, but is still basically intact. 

The ziggurat has four steps, with the lowest step rising 10’ above the level of the swamp and each subsequent step climbing another 15’. The top step is thus 55’ above the marsh. The ziggurat is lit by the glow of fire emanating from its first and third steps (see text below). 

Environmental Effects: As a site of great and ancient evil, the entire ziggurat lies under the effect of a hallow spell (see new spells). This means that creatures of chaotic evil alignment benefit from +2 to all rolls (saves, ‘to hit’ rolls, etc.), while those of all other alignments suffer a -2 penalty to all rolls. Should the PCs have cleansed the upper heqeti temple (area 7-78) of its evil (through the use of a hallow spell), then the hallow effect here on Level 10 will be removed. It is, of course, also possible to unhallow the ziggurat through the application of good-oriented divine rituals; doing so after a climactic battle here should be considered a good and heroic act. The rituals for hallowing the ziggurat are costly (20,000 gp) and time-consuming (three weeks). 

A Climactic Battle!
For those adventuring parties wishing to cleanse Arden Vul of the heqeti presence, an epic combat on and around the ziggurat is likely. In preparing for such a combat, the GM must consider the state of heqeti awareness of the PCs’s progress (see 9-79 and Level 10 introduction). If the heqeti are expecting intruders, then the heqeti leaders will have assumed fixed positions in the vicinity of the ziggurat, and will be ready to repel the PCs with spells and summoned allies. The resulting combat may provide a suitably epic conclusion to many campaigns. If, however, the PCs have managed to approach Level 10 without alerting the heqeti to their presence, then the ziggurat will provide a substantially easier challenge, as some of the heqeti leaders will be found elsewhere in the complex. 

Finally, GMs should also be aware that it is possible for the PCs to summon and fight Kauket himself! The procedures for such a foolish action are described in the Level 10 introduction and in the text for area 10-37.

### 10-32: Ziggurat of Kauket, First Step

The first step of the great ziggurat is the most badly damaged from previous wars. It rises 10’ above the level of the surrounding marsh, and is accessed from area 10-16 via a short, 5’ staircase. Statues occupy three of its four corners; next to each statue is a brazier with glowing red coals. Two doors on the west side of the step lead inward to area 10-36; these are unlocked. The walls leading to the second step are densely carved with high-relief images of heqeti worshipping a strange salamander with elephant feet and human hands (Kauket).

Statues: The three remaining statues on this step (one was destroyed in antiquity) are 13’ tall. Each appears as a slug-like being with two powerful hind legs and two arms that grip a spear, a mattock, and an axe respectively. The statues are granite, and finely carved, despite numerous lichen growths and pitting from age; they could be sold for 900 gp each. In addition, the statues moan constantly in a low-pitched, eerie tone. The heqeti assume this is Kauket speaking to them, when in fact it is the effect of a simple, but very ancient, enchantment. The moaning rises and falls in volume, and is punctuated every couple of rounds with a loud croaking sound. If a good-aligned being approaches within 10’ of any of the statues, a powerful dispel magic effect emanates from the statue in question; this effect covers a sphere in a 20’ radius around the statue. This effect can be permanently defeated if a 12th-level caster casts dispel magic on each statue.

Unalerted: If the complex is not alerted, then this step will have 9-16 heqeti pilgrims milling about, admiring the ziggurat. Four chosen will also be present, one posted by each of the doors to 10-36.

Alerted: If the heqeti are expecting the PCs, then nobody will be present here, but a troop of eight chosen led by Pikaressa, the Second Tongue (see 10-49) will be hiding inside area 10-36, ready to burst from the doors as soon as the PCs approach.

9-16 heqeti hopper pilgrims (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 31, 30, 29, 28, 28, 27(x3), 26(x3), 24, 23, 22, 22, 21; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 39, 38, 35, 30; #AT 2; Dmg 3-12 (halberd +1), 1-6 (bite). Special 
attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: halberd +1.

### 10-33: Ziggurat of Kauket, Second Step

The second step suffered less damage in antiquity. It rises 15’ above the first step and 25’ above the level of the marsh. It is accessed either via stairs from 10-32 or via the bridge (10-21) leading from area 10-20. A single door on the south wall leads inward to area 10-37. The riser for the third step is once again carved with images of Kauket smiting all manner of foes, both demonic, mammalian, and unknown.

Unalerted: If the complex is not expecting the PCs’ arrival, there will be 4-7 pilgrims waiting to visit area 10-37. Watching them are two heqeti builders.

Alerted: iI the heqeti are prepared for intruders, then the step will be empty.

4-7 heqeti hopper pilgrims (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 22, 20; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

2 heqeti builders (see new monsters), 6th/6th-level fighter/clerics of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 90’, 120’ swimming; HD 6; HP 46, 43; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (short sword +2 of wounding). 
Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: heqeti mail armor (-2 to AC); short sword +2 of wounding, amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items). Spells: bless, command, cure light wounds, light, 
fear; chant, hold person (x2), silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic, curse.

### 10-34: Ziggurat of Kauket, Third Step

The third step rises 15’ above the second and 40’ above the level of the marsh. It is accessed via a staircase from 10-33 (on the western side). Bronze statues stand proudly at each of its four corners. Next to each statue is a brazier that glows with red-hot coals. The walls leading to the fourth step are carved in a more restrained, but still impressive fashion: a 5’-tall band of carved images extends around the entirety of the top step, depicting a single, huge salamander surrounded by fawning heqeti.

Statues: The bronze statues are 9’ tall and depict anonymous heqeti with arms upraised and bowing towards the pinnacle of the ziggurat. The workmanship of the statues is fairly crude, and thus they will only bring 300 gp each. Like the statues on the first step, these are enchanted with a unique effect, a sort of ‘delayed blast unholy word.’ If the Great Tongue (10-47) is standing anywhere on the ziggurat, he is able to use his action on a given round to croak out a command directed at one of the four statues; immediately, the designated statue will emit a deafening unholy word (radius 30’). The Great Tongue can perform this feat once per statue per day.  Weakening Rimmaq-Isfet by poison on Level 8 (see area 8-76) causes the statues on the third step to lose their ability to utter unholy words.

Unalerted: If the complex has not been warned of the PCs’ arrival, no heqeti are present here.

Alerted: Six heqeti chosen are waiting here, armed with javelins and halberds. Their task is to prevent intruders from reaching the fourth step of the ziggurat.

6 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 44, 41, 40, 38, 35, 35; #AT 2; Dmg 3-12 (halberd +1), 1-6 (bite). Special 
attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: halberd +1.

### 10-35: Ziggurat of Kauket, Fourth Step

The pinnacle of the ziggurat lies 15’ above the third step and 55’ above the level of the marsh. It is accessed either via the bridge (10-19) from area 10-18 or via stairs from 10-34. A shallow copper depression about 8’ in diameter occupies the exact center of the step; in the center of the basin is a 6”-diameter hole leading inside the ziggurat (to 10-37). The basin is stained with blood. Four copper shepherd’s crooks rise 5’ above the basin, from each of which hang strong copper restraints. Sacrifices to Kauket are bound to the crooks and then exsanguinated into the basin.

Unalerted: There is a 45% chance that Reepsiq, the Great Tongue (see 10-47), is present here, preparing a sacrifice to Kauket (select sacrifice from area 10-43). If Reepsiq is present, he is accompanied by three heqeti builders (see new monsters).

Alerted: If the complex is awaiting the PCs, Reepsiq, the Great Tongue (see 10-47), and Qassapik, the Chief Weaver (see 10-48), will be present here, preparing spells in order to defend the ziggurat. With them will be three heqeti builders. The two leaders will already have summoned demonic allies; three invisible keqemandri will already be levitating near the ziggurat, ready to swoop down upon intruders.

Kauket Arrives: It is possible for the PCs to summon Kauket himself, whether knowingly or inadvertently. See text at 10-37 for details. If Kauket is summoned, he appears atop the fourth step with three keqemandri servitors. Woe to the PCs! Note: it is possible to slightly weaken Kauket by destroying the great statue of the demon prince that is located on Level 9 (area 9-12); see text there.

Reepsiq, the Great Tongue, 17th-level heqeti cleric: for stats, see 10-47.

Qassapik, the Chief Weaver, 10th-level cleric/9th-level magic user: for stats, see 10-48.

3 heqeti builders (see new monsters), 6th/6th-level fighter/clerics of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 90’, 120’ swimming; HD 6; HP 46, 45, 43; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (short sword +2 of wounding). Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: heqeti mail armor (-2 to AC); short sword +2 of wounding, amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items).

and 33% for a type V-VI demon). The spear of Kauket (see new magic items) has many magical powers. GM Note: should the statue of Kauket at area 9-12 be destroyed or its power neutralized (via hallow spell - see new spells), Kauket’s magic resistance drops from 80% to 55%.

### 10-36: Ziggurat of Kauket, Inner Fane

Accessible only from the doors on the first step of the ziggurat, this 10’-tall chamber holds the sacred cult objects of Kauket. Light is provided by two braziers filled with burning coals. The interior walls are painted an unsettling shade of yellow-green, with large symbols of Kauket everywhere: white tear drops, black and barbed spears, white worms, gaping toothless maws, etc. The centerpiece of the chamber is a stone table about 5’ tall on which are laid the holy relics of Kauket. These include three 8” curved fangs purported to be Kauket’s, a copper bowl with seven pure white tears of Kauket (see new magic items), a six foot spear of ebony said to be the spear of Kauket (actually just a spear +2), a set of keys (one gold and one platinum) to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D), and a replica of Kauket’s palace (located on the 497th layer of the abyss), carved out of a 3’-diameter amethyst (10,000 gp).

Unalerted: A small but regular stream of heqeti pilgrims filters through this chamber, stopping briefly to admire the cult objects. See text and stats at 10-32.

Alerted: If the complex is ready for intruders, a strike team of eight heqeti chosen led by the Second Tongue, Pikaressa, will be waiting here, ready to spring an ambush on any intruders who reach the first step (10-32).

8 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 45, 44, 42, 40, 39, 38, 35, 31; #AT 2; Dmg 3-12 (halberd +1), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: halberd +1.

Pikaressa, the Second Tongue (see stats at 10-49)

### 10-37: Ziggurat of Kauket, Sacrificial Chamber

The second interior chamber of the heqeti ziggurat is accessible only from the door on the southern wall of the second step. It leads to the sacrificial chamber and the true holy of holies for the ziggurat. 

The octagonal chamber holds a 5’-tall stone pillar atop of which rests a copper bowl. Blood from sacrifices slain on the fourth step (10-35) drips through holes in that step to land in the 
bowl here. 

Four of the eight walls are carved with half-relief sculptures. The sharp ends of horns taken from bizarre or magical creatures are thrust into three of the sculptures. A double-sized, pearl-white tear of Kauket (see new magic items) is thrust into the open, wide end of each horn; the mouths of the horns are all stained with blood. 

Sculpture #1 (southwest)
Image: Kauket, stirring in the mud with his spear; barely visible are small, tadpole-like creatures wriggling in the mud.
Horn: A midnight black, straight demon’s horn (3’ long), with silver glyphs incised into it (475 gp). It is inserted into the mud at the feet of Kauket.

Sculpture #2 (northwest)
Image: Kauket stands amid a crowd of heqeti hoppers; large tears fall from his eyes into the mouths of grateful followers.
Horn: A purple, curved, ram-like demon’s horn, albeit with unsettling incrustations across its 4’ length. The horn is thrust into Kauket’s heart.

Sculpture #3 (northeast)
Image: Kauket leaps into battle, wielding an enormous spear; hordes of keqemandri and other demons follow him.
Horn: A 3’ segment of a unicorn horn. The tip is stuck into Kauket’s spear. 

Sculpture #4 (southeast)
Image: Kauket stands atop a ziggurat, while heqeti throng the lower steps.
Horn: The horn is missing; if present it would be inserted into Kauket’s mouth. The missing horn is pale green, with a broad spiral and with irregular tufts of black bristly hair growing from it. It may be found in area 5-95A.

Summoning Kauket: Should the missing horn be inserted into the fourth sculpture, and blood poured into each of the horns, then Kauket will manifest atop the ziggurat within 2-6 turns. Reepsiq, the Great Tongue (10-47), is aware that the absence of the fourth horn prevents him from fully communing with, or summoning, Kauket. He would give almost anything for the return of the horn. The missing horn was, in fact, taken by the rudishva when they cleansed the ziggurat millennia ago. Recognizing its importance, they stored it in a hidden vault (area 5-95A). Information on the location of the vault and the horn is lost to all living beings; only the rudishva AIs can, if asked, confirm the horn’s existence and describe how to access it (see AIs at 6-27 and SL14-13). 

### 10-38: Hall of the Builders

This large, 25’-tall chamber is dominated by an enormous carved heqeti head that rises out of a central pool. The head is carved out of a 20’-diameter half-column of stone that rises 15’ into the air before branching into two slender (5’-wide) bridges that connect to the walls of the chamber. The central column is carved to resemble the upturned maw of a heqeti hopper, with the bridges as tongues emerging from that maw. A narrow entrance in the central column allows one to climb a spiral staircase and thus access the tongues/bridges. The carved half-column is ancient, pitted and damaged in places, but still exudes the oily sheen of active heqeti habitations.

Circling the chamber at a level 15’ above the floor is a 5’-wide walkway. The walkway can be accessed by climbing, or by using the spiral stair and tongues/bridges. The walkway allows one to view a pictorial history of the heqeti occupation of Arden Vul, in the form of bas-relief panels some 5’ high. The bas-reliefs differ in age and artistic skill, as well as in content; they can be roughly divided into four programs, starting from the northeast and working clockwise.

Discovery of Arden Vul
Age: 3,600 years
Scenes: Primitive heqeti entering a cavern, constructing the ziggurat, genuflecting before Kauket, standing before twin waterfalls (i.e.. 9-66, 9-67)

Golden Age of Heqeti Habitation
Age: 2,900 years
Scenes: Fighting rudishva, varumani, and varuda; constructing the pukel-manders; re-building the ziggurat; heqeti dwellings along a canyon (9-109); heqeti before a geyser and pool (SL6-1)
Carving Skill: Good
Length: 15 panels, some 75’

Wars and Reverses
Age: 1,850-2,000 years
Scenes: A builder confronts a spear-maiden (i.e., Arden); hoppers assault humans; heqeti trying to summon Kauket; the final panels are blank
Carving Skill: Begins with high quality, last panel is primitive
Length: 5 panels, 25’

Return of the Heqeti
Age: 300 years
Scenes: Re-occupying the ziggurat; summoning worms of Qok (see new monsters)
Carving Skill: Impressive
Length: 3 panels, 15’
Unalerted: Two heqeti builders and two apprentice weavers are inspecting their racial histories.

Treasure:
The heqeti historical carvings, if removed from the wall, would bring 500-1,000 gp per panel, depending on the quality.

### 10-39: Practice Grounds

This floor of this chamber is covered in a 1’ layer of dirt. Its walls are painted deep black, with huge white teardrops on each cardinal face. An 8’-tall, 4’-wide stone pillar rises from the center of the room. To it are shackled three bestial varumani (see new monsters); between the varumani are four practice dummies made of leather-stuffed clay. Eight torches are set into sconces along all four walls.

Unalerted: If the complex is unalerted, one of the heqeti apprentices and several chosen are found here, practicing spells and weapons skills. The heqeti like to use varumani as sparring dummies due to their regenerative powers. 

Alerted: No one is present.

### 10-40: Quarters of Neepariq the Weaver

Neepariq’s quarters are spartan, especially compared with his rival Cheksib (10-13). The floor is covered with several inches of sand. A tall table (5’) runs across the entirety of the west wall; various objets d’art and curiosities line the table. Four 3’-diameter urns filled with marsh soil and water stand in the corners of the room: from these grow large specimens of the glowing friend (see new flora). Against the east wall is a trapped stone chest. 

Neepariq enjoys the meditative pursuit of drawing elaborate geometric patterns (often a labyrinth) in the sand, sometimes using his stock of pieces of obsidian to accentuate the pattern. The current pattern shows an enormous eye surrounding a dozen teardrops, each picked out in obsidian. A set of heqeti footprints leads from the door to the sleeping niche, to the chest, and to the table. In the northwest corner of the room a concealed ivory coffer 
is set into a hole in the stone floor under 2” of sand. The coffer is encircled by a thin steel chain attached to a pull ring. If one knows where to look for the ring, it is relatively easy to find; then one can pull the coffer out of the sand with the ring.

Trap (chest): A glyph of warding in the form of energy drain was cast on the chest by the Great Tongue. The glyph drains one level of experience from its victim. 

Neepariq, a heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 12th-level cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 12; HP 81; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (staff +2). Constant abilities: 
infravision; WIS 18 for bonus spells. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items); staff +2; a heqeti ring (see new magic items); and a rod of beguiling (13 charges). Cleric spells: bless, cause fear, command (x2), create water, cure light wounds, light, resist cold; augury, chant, hold person (x2), resist fire, silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; animate dead, blindness, dispel magic (x2), prayer, speak with dead; cause serious wounds, divination, protection from 
good 10’ radius, sticks to snakes; flame strike, true seeing; aerial servant, heal.

### 10-41: Quarters of the Apprentices

Seven junior heqeti weavers call this hall home. A low pool filled with murky water occupies the center of the chamber. Fourteen sleeping niches are built into the walls of the chamber. The apprentices rarely spend much time here, as they are tasked with duties throughout the ziggurat area.

Unalerted: If the heqeti are taken unawares, then two apprentices are sleeping here.

Alerted: No one is present here. 

1 apprentice heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 4th-level magic user: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 4; HP 12; #AT 1; Dmg 2-5 (dagger). Constant abilities: infravision.

### 10-42: Barracks of the Ziggurat Guards

This 15’-tall chamber serves as the barracks for the chosen and builders who help to guard the ziggurat and surrounding areas. Each 10’ section of wall has three sleeping niches cut into it; this makes a total of twenty-seven niches. The niches have some rushes from the marsh, plus 1-3 mesh sacks containing personal items. Running through the center of the chamber is a shallow pool (3’ deep, 5’ wide, 15’ long) filled with murky, silty water. At the north and south ends of the pool are peapod-shaped, stone reclining benches. Cleverly mounted to the walls between and beside the sleeping niches are weapons racks, which contain thirty-six spears, seventeen javelins, and six stone maces.

Unalerted: Four heqeti chosen are resting here.

Alerted: The chamber is empty.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 41, 39, 38, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-12 (halberd +1), 1-6 (bite). Special 
attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: halberd +1.

Treasure:
Scattered among the personal effects in the sleeping niches are forty-three small bits of hand-made jewelry (15 gp each); a jade figurine of a duergar (175 gp); sixteen silver plugs (35 sp each); and a sandstone figurine of a gravid heqeti female (55 gp).

### 10-43: Water Cells

The heqeti keep prisoners in horrible water-filled pits prior to bringing them to the ziggurat (10-35) for sacrifice or consigning them to the efts for food (10-11). The pits are set in the rocky stone around a worked pathway. Each of the sixteen pits is 4’ in diameter and 10’ deep. Prisoners are secured in wooden collars that attach to bolts on the side of each pit; the collars keep each prisoner’s head at level just above the waterline. Eight of the pits currently 
hold prisoners. None of the prisoners has equipment. Two heqeti hoppers wander among the prisoners, looking for opportunities to poke them with their spears.

Gneiss would like revenge against Chert but will not betray the location of his people. Gneiss is waiting to make his escape using his invisibility and reduction. All he needs is a distraction that takes the guards out of the room.

Moder Maab, a male svirfneblin assistant burrow warden, as a 5th-level fighter: SZ S; AL NG; AC 8; HD 5+8; HP 19 (max 39); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon; MR 30%.

damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

### 10-44: Slime and Ooze Pits

This chamber is the site at which the heqeti prepare their various slimes and work to create new ones. Smelling strongly of ammonia and other chemicals, and lit only dimly by phosphorescence floating in the central pool, the chamber and the experiments performed here are directed by Qassapik, the Chief Weaver (area 10-48). A long central pit runs down the center of the chamber; it is flanked by seven niches, each containing its own smaller pit. The flanking pits are labeled A through G.

Unalerted: Two builders and a 50% chance of Qassapik (10-48).

Alerted: Two builders guard the pits at all times.

Central Slime Pit: The central pit is 40’ long, 8’ wide, and 8’ deep, and is filled with roiling and burping slimes of different colors and consistencies. Although the pit was originally filled with a fixed set of slimes extruded by Rimmaq-Isfet itself and imported from the Abyss, the noxious pit is constantly mutating, with existing slimes being re-absorbed into the base matter and new slimes being extruded. At any given moment 4-7 heqeti slimes (see new monsters) are visible on the surface of the pool. Each hour, however, there is a 75% that any one of the initial slimes will be replaced by 1-2 new ones. Slimes are quiescent until removed from the pool, at which point they will, if not contained or put into another slime pit, act according to their basic function (see below). The heqeti have been hoping to recreate their great victory against the rudishva by discovering and/or encouraging a plague slime that 
will eliminate the varumani or humans. So far, however, they have been unsuccessful (or unlucky). 

Pit A: This pit is filled with an oily, thick, greenish slime that is curative to heqeti and other amphibians (cures 2-8 HP once per hour through immersion, or 2-12 HP per full draught drunk), but poisonous to all other species (save at +2 if touched, save at -4 if drunk). It has no motility or combat abilities. There is enough of it to fill 6 delivery devices.

Pit B: A thick, viscous, grayish-green slime is found here; although it stinks horribly, it is a powerful fertilizer, and can be used to enhance plant growth. If ingested it causes hair to grow uncon-trollably at ten times normal speed for 3 weeks. There is enough of it to fill 6 delivery devices. It has no motility or combat abilities.

Pit C: The pit is filled with a thick, white slime the consistency of paint (there is enough of it to fill six delivery devices). The slime is highly corrosive to stone, earth and metal; it will eat away a 10’x10’x2” section in 1-4 hours. It could be used as a crude grenade-like projectile that will eat away metal armor and weapons in 1-3 rounds. To protect the slime pit, the pit is lined with mats made of tightly-woven reeds. Stats: 6 white, oily and thick heqeti slimes 
(see new monsters, roll for type) slimes (see new monsters, roll for type): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 20’ on liquids; HD 2; HP 14, 13, 11, 11, 10, 9; #AT 1; Dmg special; MR 15%. Special attacks: corrode stone, earth and metal. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.

Pit D: A deadly type of heqeti slime (see new monsters) fills this pit; there is enough of it to fill six delivery devices. This slime has been harvested from the central pit and carefully encouraged by Qassapik. Stats: 6 burnt orange, softened-butter-like heqeti slimes (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 20’ pseudopod; HD 2; HP 15, 13, 12, 10, 10, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12; MR 15%. Special attacks: kills in 2 rounds if not scraped off. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.

Pit E: A clear, viscous slime fills this pit. It is used to coat the stone walls in heqeti habitations, and is the source of the pebbled, oily surface of such stonework. If applied to stonework, it produces the ‘heqeti effect’ in 3-6 hours. The slime is otherwise harmless. It has no motility or combat abilities.

Pit F: This pit contains one randomly-determined heqeti slime (see new monsters; use tables to determine type and effect). There is enough of it to fill three delivery devices.

Pit G: This pit contains one randomly-determined heqeti slime (see new monsters; use tables to determine type and effect). There is enough of it to fill three delivery devices.

Delivery Devices: Stacked by the entrance are twelve oval containers, each about 2’ long. The ovals are made of a strange grey-brown chitinous substance and feature a porous membrane on one end. These ovals are transport and delivery systems for heqeti slimes; once a slime is scooped into the container, it can be thrown as a projectile or cast into the water (the porous membrane then allowing the slime to seep into the water).

Qassapik, the Chief Weaver (for stats see 10-48).

2 heqeti builders (see new monsters), 6th/6th-level fighter/clerics of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 90’, 120’ swimming; HD 6; HP 46, 45; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (short sword +2 of wounding). 
Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: heqeti mail armor (-2 to AC); short sword +2 of wounding, amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items). Spells: bless, command, cure light wounds, light, 
fear; chant, hold person (x2), silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic, curse.

4-7 heqeti slimes (see new monsters) in the main slime pit: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV varies; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 12, 12, 11, 9; #AT 1; Dmg varies; MR 15%. Special attacks: varies. Special defenses: varies. The specific features (color, consistency, motility, and effect) should be determined using tables found in the new monsters appendix.

Other heqeti slimes (see new monsters) found in one of the specific pits are detailed above.

### 10-45: The Tongue’s Ear

The chamber’s walls are painted white; in the center of each is painted a huge black, barbed spear. Rising 4.5’ from the center of the floor is a large, spiral, horn. The horn is a greenish-shade of yellow, with many ugly carbuncles. The heqeti refer to the horn as “the Tongue’s Ear”, as those seeking an audience with the Great Tongue (10-47) or another of the heqeti leaders must speak their petition into the open mouth of the horn. Such petitions are vocalized through a specialized, permanent magic mouth placed on the north wall of the corridor running between 10-47 and 10-49. To prevent frivolous petitions, four heqeti chosen (see new monsters) stand guard in the chamber. If intruders manage to get 
to this point without alerting the Great Tongue or others, one of the chosen immediately rushes to the horn and croaks a warning; the heqeti leaders will then flee through the secret door to 10-53 to rally a response.

Unalerted: Four heqeti chosen.

Alerted: No one is present here.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 46, 44, 42, 39; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8 (halberd +1), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: halberd +1.

Treasure:
The horn, from a creature native to the abyss, could be broken off carefully from where it is inserted into the stone floor and sold for 1,250 gp. 

## Level 10: 46 - 62

### 10-46: Great Tongue’s Overlook

This ledge provides a view of the marsh and ziggurat from a position 55’ above the floor of the marsh. The worked walls are pebbled and oily, and contain two 5’x5’ panels displaying half-relief sculptures. The sculptures are incredibly lifelike, are still partly painted in vibrant colors, and depict heqeti weavers summoning keqemandri. If hacked out of the walls, they might bring 10,000 gp to an Archontean collector of curiosities.

Unalerted: If the complex is taken by surprise, there are no inhabitants here.

Alerted: Three heqeti apprentices, waiting to support the Great Tongue (see 10-35) with spells.

2 apprentice heqeti weavers (see new monsters), as a 4th-level magic users: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 4; HP 12, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 2-5 (dagger). Constant abilities: 
infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: each as a wand of magic missles (14, 17 charges) and a curved dagger. Memorized spells for each: enlarge, magic missile, spider climb; strength, web. Spell books: detect magic, enlarge, magic missile, protection from good, read magic, spider climb; darkness 15’ radius, invisibility,  strength, web. One of the two has been afflicted by the light master effect from the magical nexus at 10-12. Although his infravision is strong, he emits a purple glow visible for 150’.

1 apprentice heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 4th-level cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 120, 90’ swimming’; HD 4; HP 21; #AT 1; Dmg 3-8 (club +1). Constant abilities: 
infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: club +1; heqeti spore bomb (see Arden Vul items). Spells prayed for: bless, command, cure light wounds, darkness, detect magic; chant, hold person, resist fire, silence 15’ radius.

### 10-47: The Great Tongue

This opulent chamber is the residence of Reepsiq, the heqeti tasked with overseeing the ziggurat and other heqeti activities in Arden Vul. That heqeti is, of course, the Great Tongue.

A massive carved image of the mouth of Kauket occupies almost all of the south wall; it is easily 10’ in diameter. The mouth is gaping open, and a sinuous stone tongue emanates from it, curving down to join a shallow, semi-circular pool that is also connected to the south wall. The tongue’s curves are such that not only can Reepsiq sleep on one of the upper curves, the lowest portion of the tongue serves as a throne-like chair in which he sits for audiences. The pool into which the tongue descends is home to a half-dozen glowing friend (see new flora) specimens, which give the chamber an eerie half-light. The other walls are painted black, with numerous white teardrops. Against the west wall are two locked and trapped stone chests.

The current Great Tongue is Reepsiq. Reepsiq is bowed with age, and walks with the aid of a walking stick; he is missing one eye, moreover, and bears many battle scars. Despite his kindly, slow-moving, avuncular appearance, Reepsiq is keenly intelligent and capable of moving with startling quickness and direction. He loathes humans, and has made it his goal to expel humans and their ‘allies’ (by which he includes humanoids and even the varumani) from Arden Vul. He reluctantly deals with the other evil Underearth races, and allows a modicum of trade to take place here (see 10-54), but he is at his core a xenophobe. His unshaking confidence and vision have made him trusted and respected, even despite his failure to summon Kauket in person (see 10-37). 

Unalerted: Reepsiq is present here if the heqeti do not suspect trouble. Note that should the guards at 10-45 warn him of trouble through the horn/magic mouth, he will flee through the secret door to 10-53 so as to avoid being trapped in his chamber.

Alerted: If the complex is on alert, Reepsiq is to be found atop the ziggurat (10-35).

Trap (symbol of persuasion): A symbol of persuasion is cast on the wall above the inside of the door; those entering are affected unless they take special precautions.  

Trapped Chests (glyphs of warding): The chests are trapped with glyphs of warding that, if not detected and disarmed, drain an energy level from the hapless visitor.

GM Note: A permanent magic mouth of sorts is located on the wall across from the entrance to this room. It activates whenever someone speaks into the horn in area 10-45, and merely repeats (in a loud, heqeti voice) whatever was spoken there.

Reepsiq, the Great Tongue, as a heqeti weaver (see new monsters) and a 17th-level cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 17; HP 79; #AT 1; Dmg 2-4 (staff of the serpent, adder). Constant abilities: infravision; WIS 18 for bonus spells. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: choker of the Great Tongue (see new magic items); a heqeti ring (see new magic items); staff of the serpent (adder); cleric scroll with dispel magic (x2); cleric scroll with gate spell; cleric scroll with symbol of pain; a key to the secret doors leading to 10-53; and six pieces of amber jewelry worth 1,675 gp total. Cleric spells: bless, cause fear, command (x2), cure light wounds (x2), darkness, detect magic, light, protection from good; augury, chant, find traps, hold person (x2), know alignment, resist fire, silence 15’ radius (x2), speak with animals; animate dead, cause blindness, continual darkness, curse, dispel magic, glyph of warding, locate object, prayer, speak with dead; cause serious wounds (x2), cure serious wounds, divination, neutralize poison, protection from good 10’ radius, tongues; commune, cure critical wounds, flame strike, raise dead, true seeing; blade barrier, conjure animals, heal; unholy word.

Treasure:
In the two locked and trapped stone chests: one contains 247 pearls (100 gp each), 799 moss agate gems (10 gp each), and 33 polished rock crystals (50 gp each); the other contains 17 pure white tears of Kauket (see new magic items), three cleric scrolls, each with 
dispel magic and symbol upon it; a pledge of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items); and six pieces of amber carved in the shape of a teardrop (150 gp each).

### 10-48: The Chief Weaver

This chamber is the home of Qassapik, the heqeti Chief Weaver. Built into the west wall are small shrines to both Kauket and Rimmaq-Isfet. Against the east wall are a stone sleeping bench, a stone planter from which rises a specimen of glowing friend (see new flora), and two locked, trapped, stone chests. Against the south wall is a dais on top of which sits a strange ‘throne.’ The throne is in the shape of a teardrop 8’ tall and 5’ wide, with a 3’-wide seat cut into the front side. The teardrop is made of basalt, although it glistens with an oily sheen and smells slightly of burnt sugar. 

Like his contemporary, the Great Tongue, Qassapik is a scarred veteran of countless ambushes, deceits, and betrayals. While looking almost human, his heqeti nature is betrayed by a slit nose and the odor of burnt sugar that his sweat produces (the byproduct of a magical experiment). Qassapik is fanatical in his devotion to Kauket and Rimmaq-Isfet, and constantly spurs Reepsiq to take bolder moves into Arden Vul. His duties include training the weaver apprentices and advising the Great Tongue on all matters connected to arcane magic.

Shrines: The shrines are simple affairs. The one to Kauket takes the form of six yellow demon’s tusks (about 4’ long each) bound together with leather strips; the ‘top’ of the shrine is a piece of dried human-hide. Atop it is a simple copper bowl and a copper knife. The shrine to Rimmaq-Isfet is a 4’-tall block of red porphyry; a shallow depression is carved into the top of the block. A disgusting stew of blood, guts, and other fluids fills the depression; it is filled with maggots.

Unalerted: If the complex has not been alerted, there is a 50% chance that Qassapik is found inspecting the slime pits (10-44), a 25% chance that he is here, and a 25% chance that he is in area 10-51. Note that if he is present in his chamber when the guards at 10-45 warn the leaders of trouble through the horn/magic mouth, he will flee through the secret door to 10-53.

Alerted: No one is present. Qassapik is located at 10-35, alongside the Great Tongue.

Trapped Hidden Compartment (symbol of pain): Beneath the seat in the teardrop is a hidden compartment, in which Qassapik stores some valuables. The compartment detects as a secret door, and is easy to pry open once detected. The inside of the lid has a symbol of pain inscribed on it. Within the 3’-square compartment are the following: 16 teardrop-shaped plugs of silver (25 sp each); 160 pearls (100 gp each); a 5-lb lump of arcanum (see new magic 
items); 6 pure white tears of Kauket (see new magic items); a map made of lizard hide that shows the route through the Underearth to the main heqeti settlement as well as 3-6 other locations of the GM’s devising; an accurate map of all the heqeti areas of Level 9 (i.e., 9-31 to 9-48, 9-75 to 9-82, and 9-109 to 9-125); and Qassapik’s spell book.

Locked and Trapped Chests (glyphs of warding, poisoned locks): Like similar chests, these are trapped with glyphs of warding (energy drain). Unlike others, they are also trapped with poison needles in the locks; the poison kills unless a saving throw is made. The chests are red herrings, however, as they are both empty.

Qassapik, a heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 10th/9th-level magic user/cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 0; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 10; HP 48; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (staff of power). Constant abilities: infravision; WIS 18 for bonus spells. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: amulet of natural armor +3 (see new magic items); pledge of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items); staff of power (18 charges); ring of fire resistance; and a key to the secret doors leading to 10-53. Cleric spells: bless, command, create water, cure light wounds, detect magic, protection from good; chant, hold person 
(x2), resist fire, silence 15’ radius, snake charm; animate dead, curse, dispel magic, feign death; cure serious wounds, protection from good 10’ radius, tongues; flame strike. Magic user spells: enlarge, magic missile (x2), shield; darkness 15’ radius, mirror image, ray of enfeeblement, web; dispel magic, fireball, haste; confusion, polymorph other; cloudkill, cone of cold.

Qassapik’s Spell Book: Burning hands, comprehend lang-uages, detect magic, enlarge, hold portal, identify, light, magic missile, read magic, shield, sleep, unseen servant; continual light, darkness 15’ radius, detect invisibility, knock, magic mouth, mirror image, ray of enfeeblement, scare, shatter, strength, web; blink, dispel magic, fireball, haste, hold person, invisibility 10’ radius, slow, tongues; confusion, fear, fumble, monster summoning II, polymorph other; cloudkill, telekinesis.

### 10-49: The Second Tongue

These are the quarters of Pikaressa, the heqeti leader in charge of heqeti military matters. They are rather spartan. Along the east wall are stone sleeping bench, a locked stone chest, and a wall-mounted rack with a dozen spears (one is a spear +3). The preserved head of an owlbear is mounted on the south wall; below it are badly reeking, semi-preserved corpses of a human, a varumani, and a kaliyani that Pikaressa uses as practice dummies. By the west 
wall are several racks holding human-sized armor, trophies of Pikaressa’s battles: they include a full set of archaic Archontean legionary armor from the era of Marius Tricotor (350 gp); a suit of imperial field plate +2 (see Arden Vul items); and a suit of cursed banded mail of vulnerability -2.

Pikaressa is a strong, vigorous warrior. Dressed in her specially-made mail and wielding her deadly spear, she strikes an imposing figure among the lesser heqeti. She has a curiosity 
about human culture, which has led her to collect human rings and coins; still, she is as devoted to Kauket as the rest of the leadership. The hoppers and chosen are genuinely afraid of her. 

Unalerted: Pikaressa is present here when the heqeti are not suspecting trouble. Note that should the guards at 10-45 warn the leaders of trouble through the horn/magic mouth, she will flee through the secret door to 10-53 so as to avoid being trapped in her chamber.

Alerted: If the complex is on alert, Pikaressa is to be found in area 10-36, preparing to lead an ambush against intruders.

Locked Chest: Pikaressa doesn’t keep much wealth, preferring to donate most of it to the ziggurat treasury. The chest holds 2,113 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), a stone statuette of Kauket (100 gp), and a large lump of amber carved in the shape of a heqeti warrior (275 gp). 

Secret Door (east, in hallway): The secret door to area 10-53 is difficult to locate (1 in 8 chance). It reveals its keyhole to anyone speaking the heqeti words ‘open, now!’ within 5’ of the wall; each of the leaders holds a key. The door can also be beaten down (AC -2, HP 25), although edged weapons only do 1 HP damage and each non-magical weapon used to attack the door has a 5% cumulative chance per round of breaking during the process (magical weapons have a 2% cumulative chance).

Pikaressa, a heqeti builder (see new monsters), as a 12th/5th-level fighter/magic user (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC -1; MV 90’, 120’ swimming; HD 12; HP 51; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10 (bone spear +3 of life stealing). Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: finely-wrought heqeti mail (-4 to AC); ring of protection +2; a bone spear +3 of life stealing; a heqeti ring (see new magic items); a potion of extra healing; a potion of stone-giant strength; a key to the secret doors leading to 10-53, and six plundered gold signet rings, each worth 100-600 gp. Spells memorized: enlarge, magic missile, protection from good, shield; continual light, web; slow. Pikaressa was affected by the magnetism effect produced by the magic nexus at area 10-12. She is content that her mail and rings are effectively bonded to her. In combat, enemies wielding metal weapons have a -2 to hit her due to the magnetism; on a successful hit, moreover, the enemy must make an open doors check or else the enemy’s weapon is effectively stuck to Pikaressa.

Pikaressa’s Spell Book: Charm person, detect magic, enlarge, light, magic missile, protection from good, read magic, shield, spider climb; continual light, ESP, levitate, web; feign death, haste, slow.

### 10-50: East Causeway and Corridor

* This imposing causeway connects the pilgrims’ rest (10-21) with the eastern areas of the shrine. 
	* Where it extends into the great cavern, it rises 25’ above the level of the marsh.
	* In the corridor segment leading to 10-51, a pair of niches hold 8' tall statues.
		* They depict Reepsiq, the Great Tongue, and Qassapik, the Chief Weaver (see 10-47 and 10-48; 475 gp each). Each is festooned with small bits of leather, feathers, and small trinkets.

### 10-51: Hall of the Heqeti

This large hall provides a gathering and socializing space for heqeti pilgrims who have come to visit the ziggurat. The ceiling is 20’ tall and supported by eighteen thick columns. In the center is a large, shallow pool of murky dirty water (3’ deep) that surrounds a dais and a statue of Kauket. A dozen specimens of the glowing friend (see new flora) twine about iron rods placed along the edge of the pool. The plants provide a dim light to the area. Ordinarily the hall contains 21-40 heqeti pilgrims, who gather in the aisles formed by the columns and wade in the pool.

Statue of Kauket: The statue is about 15’ tall and shaped of red porphyry. He appears as a biped, with the trunk of a salamander), the feet of an elephant, human arms, and an oversized salamander-esque head. He carries his famous spear in an aggressive posture. His saucer-like eyes drip a liquid that hardens into tears of Kauket (see new magic items) when it hits the water of the pool. Enough liquid to form a single tear drips every hour.

Unalerted: Two apprentices are always present so as to offer advice to the pilgrims (see above). There is a 25% chance that Qassapik (see 10-48) is present here, intimidating the lesser heqeti.

Alerted: If the complex is alerted, two apprentices are stationed here to watch over the public areas.

### 10-52: Heqeti Barracks

##### 10-52a: Heqeti Barracks

This chamber is a barracks for heqeti hoppers. It is dark and smells with a stale, fishy odor. Forty-five sleeping bunks are set into the walls (although Reepsiq does not have a full complement of hoppers). Two battered wood tables, a dozen stools, racks for spears, two large stone bins full of nasty fish paste (heqeti food), and a practice dummy made of straw (and shaped like a human) stand in the center of the chamber. Only eight of the hoppers are 
actually present in the barracks at any given time.

Secret Door (on north wall of hallway): This narrow door is difficult to locate (1 in 8) and only opens if the proper key is inserted into a cleverly hidden hole. Keys are held by Reepsiq, Qassapik and Pikaressa (see 10-47 to 10-49).

8 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 29, 28, 27, 26, 24, 23, 22, 20; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

Treasure:
Twenty of the bunks contain small bits of silver, copper, and shell jewelry worth 11-20 gp per bunk.

##### 10-52b: Barracks

* This chamber is identical to area 10-52a, including inhabitants and treasure.

### 10-53: Treasury

This secret chamber serves as the treasury for the ziggurat. Four large stone bins hold the bulk of the treasure collected from the pilgrims at areas 10-20 and 10-57. These bins contain 183 semi-precious stones (carnelian, citrine, onyx and sardonyx) worth 50 gp each, plus 3,971 ornamental gems (mostly azurites, malachites, moss agates, pieces of obsidian and tiger eyes) worth 10 gp each. Mixed in with this treasure are 17 pieces of amber (100 gp each), 11 pieces of coral (100 gp each), and 1 black opal (5,000 gp).

A fifth stone bin holds more unusual goods, including the majority of Sir Mendacity’s equipment (for Sir Mendacity, see 7-81): her circlet of command and backpack of capacity (see new magic items); her key to SL10A-16, gothic armor, and sun lance (see new technological items); and her broadsword +2, +4 vs giants. The bin also holds a tome of clear thought, plus four scrolls: one with the spells enchant an item and guards and wards; a second with stone to flesh; a third scroll with power word, stun; and a fourth with mass charm. At the GM’s desire, the treasury may also contain any quest items appropriate to his/
her setting.

Secret Door (west): This door is easy to find (1 in 4) from this side. The key held by the heqeti leaders opens it (see 10-47 to 10-49).Secret Door (east): This door is easy to find (1 in 4) from this side. The key held by the heqeti leaders opens it (see 10-47 to 10-49).

### 10-54: Underearth Traders

This chamber is rather spartan, with roughly carved walls and no decoration. A half-dozen smoky torches light the area, and two tripods of heating (see new magic items) stand in its center. The handful of traders allowed by the heqeti to enter the ziggurat area and conduct business are assigned to this chamber. Each trader is responsible for his/her own possessions and security; most sell goods out of their saddlebags and sleep atop the same. Currently three traders are present.

Chert Tillis

Personality: Unctuous and servile in public, vicious and vindictive privately. Chert wears flowing black and yellow silken robes over his armor. 

Reputation and/or relations with Factions: He is well known and considered a reliable and relatively harmless occasional visitor. He has only visited the heqeti within Arden Vul, but is aware of the varumani and kaliyani.

Secret? While naturally a spy, his demeanor renders him less suspicious in the eyes of the heqeti. He hopes to learn the location of the hidden derro city that is the home of Gest Felstapper (see SL9-79); he has encountered Gest in safe zones throughout the Underearth and would very much like to learn Gest’s routes. He has thoroughly scouted the great cavern (10-15) and knows most of the routines of the heqeti leaders. He considers it impossible and/or impractical for his people to attempt a raid on the heqeti. Available Liquid Wealth: Small lumps of gold worth a total of 2,300 gp; small silver cylinders worth a total of 3,500 sp; 319 ancient Archontean pennies (see Arden Vul items).

Might Buy: Specific information (layouts, maps) about Levels 7 and 9; magic items; exotic (that is, fresh) surface-world fruits and vegetables.

Goods for Sale: 100 lb of dried mushrooms (20 gp/lb), 10 steel picks, 20 daggers, 1 poisoned dagger, 5 2-lb lumps of arcanum, 3 potions of invisibility, a copy of Thorcin Poisons and their Cures (see Arden Vul books), maps to the Silent Sea, to Lissak-Tol, and to two other Underearth locations of the GM’s choosing.

Companions: 2 duergar bodyguards, as 3rd-level fighters

Chert Tillis, 5th/6th level duergar cleric/assassin: SZ S; AL LE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 28; #AT 1; Dmg 5-8 (war hammer +2), 2-5 (daggers). Abilities: STR 16, INT 11, WIS 16, DEX 
10, CON 10, CHA 13. Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: surprise on 3 in 6. Special defenses: surprised only 1 in 10; save versus magical attacks at +4; immune to paralysis and

Psionic strength: 36. Psionic disciplines: expansion, invisibility, molecular attraction, reduction. Possessions: banded mail and shield; hammer, short sword; light crossbow and 20 bolts.

Peelstiv

Personality: Alien, mysterious, difficult to read; she doesn’t understand human/heqeti personal space, and is constantly coming too close to interlocutors’ faces. 

Reputation and/or relations with Factions: She is an unknown quantity. Given their ancient alliance with the kaliyani, the heqeti are familiar with kaliyani practice and interests; still, they 
do not know Peelstiv and thus mistrust her motives.

Secret? She is one of the most trusted and experienced agents from Lissak-Tol, and has been tasked by the eleven consortia to locate Tsilliv and the renegade heqeti of the twelfth consortium (see SL9). She poses as a trader, but is interested in any hint of news about the kaliyani traitors.

Available Liquid Wealth: 100 tiger eye gems (10 gp each), 16 pieces of coral (100 gp), and 20 lb of powdered silver (1,000 sp). Might Buy: Kaliyani artifacts, rudishva artifacts, magic items, information

Goods for Sale: Kaliyani charms (10 gp each); 3 empty rudishva lesser power supplies, sold as curios (5 gp each); 8 kaliyani asp eggs (see new magic items), 2 each of eggs of fire, eggs of 
cold, eggs of torment, and eggs of blinding; a bundle of 6 specimens each of 1-3 species of mushrooms from the new flora appendix (for prices see area 9-6). 

Peelstiv, 7th-level kaliyani soldier (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 150’ on six legs, 60’ upright; HD 7; HP 49; #AT 2; Dmg 3-9/3-8 (bastard sword +1/scimitar). Special 
defenses: immune to poison and mind-affecting spells. Special: infravision. Possessions: bastard sword +1 and a serrated scimitar; a ring of protection +2; a vial of kaliyani refreshening liquid (see Arden Vul items); small jewelry worth 179 gp; and potions of superheroism and fire giant strength.

Margarita Blood-Eyes

Personality: Hostile and aggressive, but responds well to those who stand up to her. She has a distinctive look: she sports a stone-colored full length cloak with hood covering blood red leather armor and gear. In addition, her face and forehead are coated with ash-grey makeup punctuated only by blood red eyeliner and blood red ovals on her cheeks. She does not speak Archontean, but rather an archaic dialect of Thorcin. 

Reputation and/or relations with Factions: The heqeti consider her god-possessed, and thus treat her with caution. Some would like to slaughter her out of hand due to the long enmity between humans and heqeti, but the leaders have ruled that the cult she follows makes her acceptable as a trader.

Secret? She is a representative of a reclusive cult of humans who fled the surface world 97 years ago so as to be free to worship the alien deity Mzingaloq (see Gods of Magae in the World of Archontos appendix). This cult slew a community of Svirfneblin and took the deep gnomes’s home for their own. They are xenophobic and highly paranoid, and only trade with other subterranean races out of necessity.

Available Liquid Wealth: 25 solid gold plugs shaped like elongated incisors (25 gp each); 719 ancient silver pennies; 391 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items).

Might Buy: Foodstuffs of any sort, particularly in bulk; steel or iron ingots; high quality weapons; magic items

Goods for Sale: 150 lb of nutritious lichen (35 sp/lb); 37 riding salamander eggs packed in a combination of water and mud (40 gp per egg); and a sapphire Sortian eye for which she wants 2,400 gp (see new magic items).

Companions: 4 2nd-level fighters as bodyguards. The guards’ faces are also coated with ash-grey pigment, but lack the red high-lights; all four are mute.

Margarita Blood-Eyes, 9th-level female Archontean thief: SZ M; AL CE; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 9; HP 40; #AT 1; Dmg 4-10 (broad sword +2, nine lives stealer), 1-4 (dagger). Abilities: 
STR 11, INT 14, WIS 9, DEX 17, CON 12, CHA 15. Thief skills: PP 75%, OL 72%, F/RT 60%, MS 75%, HS 61%, HN 30%, CW 98%, RL 45%. Possessions: blood-red leather armor +3; broad sword +2, nine lives stealer (2 lives remaining); poisoned dagger; copper holy symbol of Mzingaloq in the shape of an opening door (20 gp); potions of invisibility and frost giant strength.

4 cultist bodyguards, as 2nd-level male Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 17, 15, 14, 14; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 2-9 (battle axe). Special: +1 to damage from STR. Possessions: chain mail and shield; spear; battle axe.

### 10-55: Relaxation Pools

* The sound of dripping water is audible from the entrance.
* This low-ceilinged hall (8’) is dimly lit by the green phosphorescence of the glowing friend (flora).
	* Four 5'-deep pools line the floor, with several specimens of the glowing friend rising from each, from which moisture drips back into the pools.
	* Surrounding the pools are 19 relaxation beds for heqeti (stone, pea-pod shaped, allowing a heqeti to curl up while still dipping their toes into the pool).
* At the west end of the chamber is a 5'-tall,  remarkably detailed statue of two crouching heqeti facing each other with  touching tongues (a mating ritual) (the ensemble could be sold as a terrifying curiosity for 6.000 gp).
* At any given moment, 10 heqeti pilgrims are here, relaxing in the quiet and near-darkness.

10 heqeti hopper pilgrims (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 30, 29, 28, 26, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

### 10-56: Pilgrims’ Cells

* Ten small and five larger cells are placed here for pilgrims to the ziggurat of Kauket.
	* All cells are spartan, with bead-curtains of shells instead of doors.
	* The smaller cells contain six stone sleeping niches set in the walls
	* The larger contain six sleeping niches plus two chairs and a low table. 
	* If a cell is searched, roll d20 to see what it contains.
* At any given moment there are 40-60 pilgrims visiting the entire area, typically spread out among the various sites: ziggurat (10-32 to 10-37), pilgrims’ rest (10-20), and common areas (10-51, 10-54, and 10-55).
	* Only 10 pilgrims are likely to be resting in random cells (1-in-4 chance of 1d3 pilgrims per cell entered).

D20 Item(s)

* 1-5 Nothing
* 6-8 A purse made of two shells sewn together, containing 100 sp worth of powdered silver and a 25% chance for a gem worth 10-50 gp9-10 A stone statuette of a gravid heqeti with open, toothed maw (25 gp)

10 heqeti hopper pilgrims (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 30, 29, 28, 26, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

### 10-57: Tolls and Bone Gate

An imposing bone portcullis blocks access between the Underearth and the heqeti shrines on Level 10. The portcullis is made of thick, femur-sized bones lashed together with sinew. The lower portion of the portcullis slides into holes in the floor. A simple winch located on the north wall by the passage to 10-58 allows it to be raised and lowered.

The heqeti keep the portcullis lowered nearly all the time. Entrance is granted to other heqeti and selected sympathetic residents of the Underearth, including a handful of traders (see 10-54). All those entering the through the portcullis must pay a toll of 10 gp or the equivalent. The heqeti chosen (see new monsters) who guard the portcullis deposit the offerings into a 4’-tall, copper statue of a salamander-monster with open mouth. Periodically the guards empty the tolls into the treasury at 10-53.

A frontal assault that does not immediately silence or neutralize the gate-keepers is likely to alarm the whole complex, as one of the heqeti chosen will sound a spiral, demonic horn to 
alert the neighboring guards (10-54 and 10-56) and eventually all the heqeti nearby. The horn’s blast is likely to lead to a battle royale with all the inhabitants of areas 10-32 to 10-56.

3 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 40, 38, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice.

1 heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 7th-level magic user: SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 7; HP 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (throwing daggers). Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items); wand of magic missiles (23 
charges); six throwing daggers; two glass spheres of arcane assistance (one of arcane warding, one of protection) (see new magic items); potion of gaseous form. Spells: enlarge, 
jump, magic missile, shield; continual light, levitate, ray of enfeeblement; fireball, protection from normal missiles; polymorph other.

Treasure:
The copper salamander statue (250 gp), containing small valuables worth 3,790 gp. The sounding horn is worth 50 gp.

### 10-58: Heqeti Guardroom

* The pebbled walls, ceiling and floor are painted an unsettling mauve, with yellow images of wriggling tadpoles painted randomly throughout.
* A squad of eight heqeti hoppers waits here, ready to defend the ziggurat area from intruders.
	* They have a rack of spears, an upturned mushroom cap filled with water, and a basket with three heqeti spore bombs (av items). 

8 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 5th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 36, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 28, 28; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

### 10-59: Second Heqeti Guardroom

* Aside from the paint (midnight black, punctuated with white teardrops), this chamber is identical (including inhabitants) to 10-58.

### 10-60: Entry Cave

A dimly-lit balcony overlooks this cave of gently sloping flowstone that leads downward into the Underearth. The balcony is 20’ above the floor of the cave; it is formed of worked granite, is pebbled and oily, and holds two braziers filled with glowing coals. A statue and two invisible heqeti chosen (see new monsters) stand atop the balcony. The ceiling of the cave soars another 20’ above the balcony.

The heqeti chosen are tasked with watching the entry cave for dangerous monsters or intruders. They do not attack instantly, but rather wait to gather intelligence. In the case of formidable foes, one slips back to 10-58 to warn the gate guards, while the other hides in the entry cave. If foes look weak or confused, they may (50%) materialize and demand that the intruders retreat.

Statue: The statue is 12’ tall and made of bronze. It depicts a great heqeti hero of antiquity, Qisstep, brandishing a spear fiercely in the direction of area 10-62. The statue is enchanted such that any of good alignment who approach within 10’ cause the statue to bark out threats in Heqeti: “Enemies! Alert! You shall feed the worms of the marsh!” The auditory effect easily alerts the toll-keepers at area 10-57.

2 invisible heqeti chosen, as 9th-level thieves: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 9; HP 59, 55: #AT 2; Dmg 1-6 (bite), or 3-8 (javelin +1) or 2-7 (short sword). Special attacks: 
hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Thief skills: PP 70%, OL 62%, F/RT 60%, MS 70%, HS 56%, HN 30%, CW 98%, RL 45%. Possessions: 4 bone javelins +1 (3-8 dmg); short sword; potion of invisibility.

### 10-61: Salamander Pens

* Facilities for penning Underearth pack animals are located here. 
	* Stone drinking trough runs down the middle of the cave. 
	* A dozen iron chains and collars are attached to the wall, with 7 riding salamanders (new) chained up.
		* Nearby are tack and saddle-bags (empty, their trade goods taken to 10-54).
	* Two stone bins at the far northeastern corner of the cave hold food for the beasts (one has rotting meat filled with maggots and worms, the other holds dried insects). 

7 riding salamanders (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’, 90’ swimming; HD 6; HP 43, 41, 41, 39, 37, 36, 35; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12.

### 10-62: Tunnel to the Underearth

* This tunnel leads into the Underearth (unmapped), a secondary tunnel extending 3 miles to joins a major passage.
	* From there one can journey in multiple directions to various areas of the Underearth, including a heqeti residential colony; the infamous Silent Sea; a shrine devoted to Rimmaq-Isfet; the mysterious city of Lissak-Tol, home to the eleven consortia of the kaliyani (see SL9-79); and the dwellings of the other Underearth denizens.
