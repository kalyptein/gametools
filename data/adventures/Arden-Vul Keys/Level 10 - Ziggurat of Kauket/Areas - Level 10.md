## Overview

This level is home to the dreaded heqeti ziggurat built in honor of the mighty demon prince, Kauket (see areas 10-32 to 10-37). The ziggurat, with its surrounding marsh and heqeti structures, has existed in some form or another for almost 3,400 years. Despite having been ‘cleansed’ twice in antiquity (once by the rudishva and once by the Archonteans), the heqeti have returned from their hidden homes in the Underearth to re-sanctify their site. The ziggurat is once again operational, and the heqeti are starting to reoccupy their ancient halls. 

The centerpiece of the level and, in some ways, culmination of the dungeon is the enormous cavern that is occupied by a stinking marsh (10-15) and by the ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-37). Causeways and bridges lead through or above the marsh so as to connect the ziggurat with heqeti dwellings delved from the surrounding rock. To the heqeti, this area constitutes an ancient and sacred shrine, but is not a major center of their habitation. 

Custody of the site is granted to an evil high priest of Kauket known as the Great Tongue, currently a certain Reepsiq (10-47). The Great Tongue is served by several other high-level spell casters and a mixed group of heqeti hoppers, chosen, and builders. Lesser heqeti sometimes make a pilgrimage from their dwellings in the Underearth to the ziggurat. To serve these pilgrims, the Great Tongue has constructed a small complex of ‘public’ areas (areas 10-51 to 10-62). Human and demi-human intruders arriving from Level 9 (via 10-1 or 10-31) will be instantly and unquestioningly treated as foes by the heqeti. Only those arriving from the Underearth (10-62) might find a cautiously neutral reception.

Given the concentration of powerful heqeti here, the task of cleansing the area of its evil is challenging. Most PCs will approach Level 10 through the heqeti forward post on Level 9 (areas 9-76 to 9-82). If the heqeti manage to send a warning from that location (see 9-79) to Level 10, then the Great Tongue and his forces will be prepared and waiting for intruders. Their state of readiness lasts for twelve hours; after twelve hours, the Great Tongue sends a strong party of heqeti hoppers, chosen, weavers, and builders up the long passage from 10-1 to 9-82 so as to reoccupy their forward base.

While the heqeti forces are on alert, the leaders will all be found in and around the ziggurat (10-32 to 10-37), ready for a titanic battle. If the heqeti are not alerted, then they are dispersed throughout the level. Exterminating the heqeti and cleansing the ziggurat of its 
evil (see text at 10-32 to 10-37), ends the heqeti presence in Arden Vul ... at least for a generation. For, like all evil, the heqeti will eventually return, seeking to re-sanctify their holy site and again move into the other portions of Arden Vul. The only way to end the heqeti interest in the area is to destroy the ziggurat completely, e.g., by using powerful magic (earthquake, limited wish, etc.).

General Construction Notes
* Heqeti areas: All worked areas are heqeti areas

Iconic Areas
* The Ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-37)

Important NPCs
* Reepsiq, the heqeti Great Tongue (10-47)

Factions
* The heqeti fully control the entire level.

Environment 
* The Mephitic Marsh (10-15) makes the entire level humid and warm. The marsh itself smells powerfully of acid, decay, and sulphur.
* The ziggurat proper (areas 10-32 to 10-37) lies under a hallow spell (see new spells) with a 60’ radius. This effect provides a +2 bonus to all rolls (saves, ‘to hit’ rolls, etc.) for those of CE alignment, while imposing a penalty of -2 to all rolls on those of all other alignments.  The surrounding chambers and corridors lack this effect.

The Heqeti and Kauket

For generations, heqeti Great Tongues have been attempting to summon Kauket himself to aid them in their goal of reoccupying the rest of Arden Vul. They have failed, mostly because of the absence of the pale green, spiral horn necessary to complete the summoning within the ziggurat (10-37). The horn was taken by the rudishva when they defeated the heqeti in antiquity; it is currently located in a high-security rudishva vault (area 5-95A). Knowledge of the very existence of the horn is limited, even to the heqeti. Reepsiq is aware that his efforts to summon Kauket will continue to fail until a horn is restored to area 10-37, but he doesn’t 
know exactly what the missing horn looks like.

The best information on the nature and location of the pale green horn is actually held by the two rudishva AIs, RAJ-750 (6-27) and AKL-600 (SL14-13); only the AIs can provide the proper command code to access the teleporter that leads to the secret vault. Should the PCs locate the horn and learn of its proper use, they will be able to insert it in the proper place in 10-37. Doing so instantly summons Kauket, however!

GMs must carefully consider whether combat with such a powerful foe is desirable and/or necessary for their campaigns. For certain campaigns, a battle with a demon prince might be an appropriate conclusion. For others, however, such a foolish and almost certainly lethal confrontation might not be appropriate. If such a confrontation is desired, the GM should seed information about the existence of the pale green horn so as to allow the PCs to bring Kauket to this plane. For such foolhardy PCs, Kauket is fully statted in the new monsters appendix. Of course, the demon prince will bring appropriate servitors with him to the Prime Material Plane, including multiple keqemandri and other lesser demons. Forewarned is forearmed! If a GM deems combat with a demon prince to be inappropriate for his/her campaign, however, it is easy enough to occlude the existence of the horn; in such cases, 
combat with the Great Tongue and the cleansing of the ziggurat will easily serve as a satisfying culmination to the campaign.

Weakening the Heqeti

Accomplishing certain tasks elsewhere in the Halls may make the task of cleansing the ziggurat slightly easier. Of course, knowledge of how to weaken the heqeti is not common within Arden Vul. Should canny PCs seek information on how to do so, the GM ought to make the acquisition of this knowledge a quest in and of itself, one that would probably involve visiting imperial sages and archives in Archontos or communing with good-aligned deities. Some PCs may accomplish one or more of these tasks without realizing their import; if they do, so much the better for them. 

* Removing the evil hallow effect (see new spells) from the upper heqeti temple. 
	* 7-78
	* Strips the magical power from the statues on the third step of the ziggurat of Kauket (10-34); the statues will not be able to utter unholy words at the Great Tongue's command
* Weakening Rimmaq-Isfet by poisoning him through the portal in the Feasting Hall
	* 8-76
	* Removes the evil hallow (see new spells) effect that covers the ziggurat of Kauket (see introductory text for areas 10-32 to 10-37)
* Destroying the giant statue of Kauket, or neutralizing its power by casting a good-aligned hallow spell on it (see new spells)
	* 9-12
	* Weakens Kauket himself, should the demon prince be summoned to this plane (see below and area 10-37 for this process). Kauket's magic resistance is reduced by 25% (from 80% to 55%)

## Level 10: 1 - 15

### 10-1: Heqeti Road Up to 9-82

* This broad corridor is eerily lit by fungal pods that hang every 20’.  It serves as the primary connection between the ziggurat of Kauket (10-32 to 10-37) and the rest of Arden Vul.
	* The pods emit a green luminescence that reflects gently off the oiled, pebbled stonework of the road.
	* The corridor is 20’ tall and very long, extending 300’ between 9-82 and 10-2, ascending a flight of steps every 60' (the risers too large for human comfort).
	* Every 40’ the road is flanked by a pair of alcoves.
		* Most alcoves contain shapeless, damaged lumps of stone, once statues. 
		* The last four before 10-1 have new, recognizable granite statues of the contemporary leaders of the heqeti resurgence in Arden Vul, each in classically aggressive heqeti pose: slight crouches, wielding a staff or wand.
			* Caudatssa the Tongue (7-79), Reepsiq the Great Tongue (10-47), Pikaressa the Second Tongue (10-49), and Qassapik the Weaver (10-48).

### 10-2: Hall of Mouths

* Approaching from the west, an eerie green glow can be seen.
* This 25’-tall chamber is filled with scores of luminous green fungal pods hanging from pegs on the walls and ceiling (harvested from the swamp in 10-15).
	* The walls are also covered with purple lichen and yellow shelf fungus.
	* A large abstract sculpture rises from the center of a murky pool of greenish water, festooned with dripping algae, dominating the chamber.
		* Once a statue of Kauket, but damaged in antiquity and now unrecognizable).
		* Numerous warning salamanders (new) writhe in the pool and among the algae.
			* The presence of non-heqeti causes them to strobe and to dart in all directions, both into the pool and towards 10-5, 10-10, and 10-14. 
	* All but one exit is are carved to into enormous, toothed salamander mouths.
		* The carvings are incredibly ancient and badly damaged; the lower teeth were smashed in antiquity.
		* Rippling, green-and-black shell strings block sight into each mouth (rare shells, 900 gp total).
		* A patch of heqeti sign mold (flora) occupies the wall to the right side of each of mouth (inobvious, as concealed door).
			* When approached within 5’ the mold adjusts to reveal an image and a phrase (Heqeti Runic).

On Alert
* If the heqeti have been warned of approaching hostile forces (see 9-79), the forces from 10-3 and 10-4 have an ambush waiting here.
	* They have summoned aid from 10-6 and released the neo-otyugh from 10-5.  These reinforcements wait just inside the tunnel to 10-5, ready to surprise intruders once they engage with the initial heqeti forces.

### 10-3: Heqeti Watchers

* One of two teams of heqeti guardians keeps watch on the approaches to the ziggurat from this chamber.
	* The walls are painted a sickly mauve and covered with more of the yellow shelf fungus.  The floor is painted black, punctuated with a dozen, large, white teardrops.
* The 6 heqeti chosen are led by a heqeti weaver (new).

### 10-5: Ancient Hole

* The corridor is badly damaged here, with a mini cave-in on the northeast side and numerous ancient blast marks along the walls.
	* A crater blocks access down the corridor; 25’ deep but only 20’ wide, spanned by a rickety bridge of reeds, vines, and fungal fibers, anchored to the walls on either side. 
		* The hole is inhabited by a large neo-otyugh.  The heqeti feed it scraps from sacrifices and other victims.
		* The bottom is covered with several feet of biological rubbish (skins, bones, bits of leather, etc). Amid the debris are 4 heqeti stone spear-heads, 3 barbed heqeti arrows coated in Kauket’s vision (av items), and a bardiche +1, +4 vs heqeti.
	* On either end of the bridge is an upturned giant mushroom cap containing a pile of rotting viscera from unknown creatures.
	* On the south side of the hole is a pile of vine-ropes the heqeti use it to pull the neo-otyugh from the hole if necessary.
* Given sufficient warning, the heqeti in 10-3 and 10-4 use the ropes to haul the neo-otyugh out of the hole to aid in repelling intruders.

### 10-6: Crossroads Encampment

* A contingent of heqeti hoppers under the command of a lesser builder are stationed in this badly damaged crossroads.
	* The northern side of the intersection is badly damaged, with the pebbled, oily stonework giving way to rough natural granite.
	* The heqeti are working here to try to uncover some lost areas to the west and south, and have recently broken through to 10-8. 
* The encampment includes:
	* 3 baskets woven of vines (holding dried fish, dried mushrooms, and dried sausage)

### 10-7: Broken Lesser Obsidian Gates

* A pair of large, obsidian valves (similar to the iconic ones of 5-6, though much smaller) lie shattered on the floor here.
	* Beyond is a completely collapsed corridor that once led to a major shrine to Rimmaq-Isfet. It was cleansed by the Archonteans in antiquity, and the access route to it collapsed.
		* The heqeti have begun the slow process digging back to the shrine.
		* GM Note: The lost shrine provides a possibility for GM expansion.

### 10-8: Heqeti Shrine 

* This chamber superficially resembles area 9-121.
* The ceiling is 25’ tall, supported by a row of 4’-thick pillars along north and south walls.
	* Originally the pillars led down the corridor towards 10-6, but only one remains.
	* Grotesque stone faces are carved into 3 of the pillars at the east edge of the room.
		* The faces are like those at 6-92 and 9-121, each roughly humanoid, but with amphibian-oid features (bulbous eyes, slit noses and lolling tongues) and open mouth, revealing a 2’ oval compartment.
			* If a flask of the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (new) is placed in any mouth, its tongue licks the nearest person (within 5’); they become immune to acid from any of the servitors of Kauket (keqemandri, etc) for 1d4+6 turns, and are afflicted with a random effect (roll below).
	* An enormous, soapstone sculpture of Rimmaq-Isfet dominates the center.
		* It is easily 40’ long, 10’ tall and 10’ wide, and depicts the dread lord as an enormous, slug-like amphibian, its thick body resting on eight salamander-like legs, while the open maw points towards the altar at the west.  The entire statue is painted black, with yellow spots.
			* Originally, a forest of delicate feelers extended out of the toothed maw, and a ridge of 5’ tentacles extended in a circle around the mouth.  All were broken off in antiquity, and lie in pieces on the floor. 
			* Sharp teeth still line the mouth, and 3 huge lidless eyes (once holding gems, long-since stolen) span its brow.
		* It oozes an clear, oily liquid (sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (new)) that drips to the floor and pools in a subtle depression (10’ in diameter) south of the sculpture.
			* 7 flasks-full exist in the depression; the sculpture produces 1 flask / day. 
	* The west wall features a low dais (3’ tall), supporting a squat, foreboding block of orange arcanum, roughly 8’ square, carved as an open, upturned mouth (meant to depict the open maw of Rimmaq-Isfet).
		* The mouth is about 5’ in diameter, rising 3’ from the floor. The rest of the block is quite detailed, with feelers, teeth, and two pronounced, 6’-long orbital ridges along either side of the mouth.   It rests on four 3' granite cylinders carved like the head of an enemy in agony (human, varumani, rudishva, varuda).
			* Each ridge used to have 3 empty eye-sockets, sized for tears of Kauket (new). One ridge was vandalized in antiquity, and its 3 sockets are ruined and misshapen.
			* Slots carved into the east face can be used to climb to its top.
		* Four 7’ iron rods are thrust into the top of the arcanum block, and a pitiful true varumani named Bedara is suspended between them. 
			* Beaten, tortured, and gagged, she has 6 copper ritual daggers buried in her flesh; preventing full regeneration, and causing her blood to drip into the arcanum maw.  Badly injured, once regenerated, she will eagerly accompany and assist her saviors.

Teleportal
* The mouth functioned as an outgoing teleportal to other heqeti sites within Arden Vul.
	* Climbing the arcanum block, one places a tear of Kauket (new) into the appropriate eye socket (it is consumed), and then jumps into the open mouth, appeadring 10 seconds later at the destination. 
	* Only 3 eye sockets are still operative.
		* Right eye: 6-104
		* Center eye: 7-84
		* Left eye: destination destroyed in antiquity (formerly abutted SL5-32), using it causes instant death as the user is teleported into solid rock.
			* The heqeti have filled the left eye socket with mud to prevent further ‘disappearances’.

D10 Effect
* 1 Sweat uncontrollably for 7 days, -3 CHA, -1 to hit rolls
* 2 Temporary gills, allowing subject to breathe underwater, for 7 days
* 3 Eyes grow disproportionately large, -1 CHA but true seeing, for 3 days
* 4 Legs grow in power, arms atrophy: MV increased by 30’, STR -1, for 3 days
* 5 Webbing between fingers and toes, better swimming but -1 CHA
* 6 Comprehend amphibian tongues, for 7 days
* 7 Cursed (if good), blessed for 3 days if CE, nothing for other alignments
* 8 Sensitive to light for 7 days (-2 to all rolls), but gains infravision
* 9 Locate body of fresh water; knows path to at-least-pool-sized bodies of water w/in 200’
* 10 Mark of Kauket: all 9 of the above, the effects of 1-3 of which are permanent

Remove curse will remove any temporary effect, but the Mark of Kauket can only be removed through the special favor of a deity (probably at the cost of a significant quest).

GM Note
* The heqeti only recently dug their way back to this shrine. Reepsiq (10-47) and the other heqeti leaders were delighted to find the chamber, hoping to use its teleportation to return to the upper levels.
	* Only 2 of the original 6 teleportals still functioned (3 were destroyed in antiquity, 1 sends explorers to their doom).  Thus the minimal presence of heqeti outside levels 9 and 10.
	* The heqeti may repair more, reactivating teleportals to 5-41, SL6-6, and 8-162, and swiftly move to establish fortified advance positions in each of those areas.

Bedara, a true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 11 (max 55); #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or by weapon. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.
* Bedara is a senior and popular member of the varumani lodge of hunters (see 7-14); she was ambushed and captured while scouting the aroksachaul (new monster) on Level 9. The other hunters (and especially Nolgi) will be eternally grateful to her rescuers.

### 10-9: Broken Corridor Fragment

* This section of corridor is badly damaged; fully blocked by the destruction wrought in antiquity.
* Secret Door (east): magically held. 

### 10-10: Heqeti Eft Ponds

* Despite the ruined nature of its western side, this 20’-tall hall is still in use by the heqeti.
	* It is warmer and more humid than surrounding areas, subtly lit by more green, luminescent pods on the walls. 
	* Originally 6 oval ponds flanked a larger central pool, but the western 3 ponds were destroyed in antiquity.
	* The 3 surviving ponds are 3’ deep and filled with murky, brownish, algae-clouded water taken from the mephitic marsh (10-15). 
		* 17 heqeti efts swim in these maturation ponds.
		* One pond contains a ring of acid resistance (new) hidden in the murk.
	* The central pool is deeper (7’) and filled with clear water that recirculates through six huge tusks that project from the pool’s rim, used for heqeti mating.
* 4 heqeti chosen stand guard.
	* The sound of combat here brings Feqarrip from 10-11 to investigate.

17 heqeti efts (non-combatants): SZ S; AC 8, HP 2.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8 (spear +1), 1-6 (bite).

Possessions: spear +1.

### 10-11: Abattoir

* A dais and the stump of a statue are visible by the north wall.
	* The heqeti have repurposed this area for food storage and preparation.
	* A score of carcasses hang from hooks in the ceiling, in various state of draining and/or curing.
		* Two are still alive: Erenbald and Mox.
	* A stone table rests against the southeastern wall; a half-dozen sharp copper blades rest on its blood-soaked surface.
* Feqarrip, an heqeti weaver responsible for the care and feeding of the efts, lurks among the hanging corpses.
	* She is quick to join combat in area 10-10.

GM Note
* Erenbald and two companions were exploring level 7 with Mox as a guide; they discovered 7-84 but were overwhelmed by the heqeti nearby.
* Their companions were sacrificed in the temple at 7-79, but Erenbald and Mox were delivered to level 10 for interrogation and eventually designated as food for the efts.

### 10-12: Magic Nexus

* A dangerous magical hot spot persists here, where the ancient corridors were destroyed in antiquity by a clash of Archontean and heqeti magics.
	* Difficult to spot, appearing as a shimmer in the (darkened) corridor (mages passively spot it on a 1-in-6, thieves 1-in-8).  Active investigation spots it instantly.
	* It inflicts a variety of unpleasant effects on those who pass through it.
		* Dispel magic or remove curse by a 12th-level caster may remove them.
	* GM Note: the heqeti are reticent to re-delve these collapsed areas due to these effects.

D8 Effect

1
Electrostatic Charge: victim takes 2-16 HP electric damage, hair turns bone white and stands straight up. 

2
Magnetism: victim’s skin is magnetized, causing all iron-based objects within 2’ to adhere to his/her skin. It takes a successful open doors check to pull the item(s) free. Combat with iron/steel weapons is impossible

3
Narcolepsy: tension and conflict produce in the victim an impulse to sleep. At the start 
of any stressful endeavor, the victim must save vs spells or fall asleep for 1-4 rounds. 

4
Magic Magnet: victim is attuned to magic, such that magic user spells cast at others are likely to target him/her instead. For every spell cast at a person or object within 30’ of the victim, the victim must save vs spells or take the effects on him/herself. Note: this might aid 
a party, but might also hinder it.

5
Light Master: the victim possesses infravision and ultravision to 60’. Unfortunately, he/she also emits a bright purple glow, rendering him/her visible at 150’.

6
Phase Distortion: victim continuously comes in and out of phase. This acts as a blur spell on him/her in combat, but also causes permanent balance and dexterity issues; for non-combat purposes, the victim’s DEX is reduced by 3, as the victim has trouble knowing where to put his/her feet.

7
Echo Effect: victim’s hearing is badly damaged. Listen rolls are reduced by 3-12%. This may render some races effectively deaf.

8
Monster Magnet: victim doubles chances for wandering monsters.


### 10-13: Quarters of Cheksib the Weaver

* This spacious, 15'-tall hall has been repurposed as the residence of Cheksib the weaver, one of the Great Tongue’s (10-47) chief lieutenants.
	* The walls are painted inky black, with yellow spots dotting the darkness.
	* A low, stone pool is attached to the north wall; it is murky and contains small fish, amphibians, lichen, and water plants.
		* South of the pool are two oval lounging devices (5’-long, empty peapods sloped so the head is 3’ higher than the foot).
		* Cheksib and a guest can rest in the pods, with their feet dangling in the pool.
	* By the south wall:
		* 2 stone sleeping benches.

### 10-14: Broken Obsidian Gates 

* Smaller cousins of the famous Obsidian Gates (see area 5-6) once stood here, blocking the main route to the Mephitic Marsh (10-15) from the west.
	* The valves were blasted apart by the rudishva in antiquity, leaving 2’-wide stumps that still swing easily on their hinges.
		* Hanging from each fragment are roughly a dozen heads of sentient creatures, in varying states of decay.  Most are skeletal, but there are a few still with flesh: an aroksachaul (new), a goblin, and a human.

### 10-15: The Mephitic Marsh

* This enormous cavern is home to the infamous ziggurat of Kauket (see 10-32 to 10-37).
	* It and other structures rise from a deep, smelly marsh that roils and burps from geothermal forces; warm, humid, and dimly lit by green and yellow phosphorescent lichen and algae.
		* The cavern is 90’ tall, with the bottom 20’ a soggy mixture of wet humus, nitrogenated water in ponds and rivulets, and decaying biological matter.
			* It smells powerfully of acid, decay, and sulphur.
		* A variety of plant life grows; dozens of species of mushrooms, lichens, and algae.  Two unusual types of flora dominate:
			* A fruticose, aquatic version of wolf lichen known to the heqeti as acid drops (flora), slightly dangerous, containing an acid toxic to mammals.
			* A variety of brown algae known as the glowing friend (flora) whose phosphorescent pneumocyst sacs allow it to float gently in the humid air, providing dim illumination through the marsh.
		* Scores of species of insects inhabit the swamp:
			* Finger-nail sized skimmers to fist-sized dragonflies and spiders.
			* Blind cave fish inhabit the larger ponds.
			* Acid salamanders (new) prey on the smaller creatures.
	* The surface of the marsh is and wet and swampy, with multiple pools, rivulets of brown water, and little try land (+1x difficult terrain).
		* May move at 3/4 speed, but save vs poison each round or take 1d4+1 damage from brushing against the toxic sap of the acid drops.

* 1-in-6 chance per turn of attracting 1d3+1 of these voracious creatures.

16 acid salamanders (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’, 90’ swimming; HD 7; HP 53, 52, 50, 49, 49, 48, 48, 47(x3), 46, 46, 45, 45, 44, 44; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: acid spit. Special defenses: immune to acid.

## Level 10: 16- 31

### 10-16: Least Causeway

* Rising only 5’ above the marsh, this causeway is the lowest of the three connecting to the ziggurat of Kauket (10-32).
	* Short staircases provide access into the marsh on either side.  2'-wide channels through the causeway allow water and creatures to cross sides.
	* The portion of the causeway closest to the ziggurat was badly damaged in both the rudishva and Archontean wars.
	* The more intact, western portion is lined with 4’-tall iron stakes, on which hang decomposing corpses of various sacrificial victims – human, goblin, varumani, etc.
* If the heqeti are on alert, a welcoming party of builders, hoppers and chosen will be waiting on the causeway and in the nearby marsh.

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 44, 41, 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8 (spear +1), 1-6 (bite).

### 10-17: Lower Summoning Platform

* Rising 35’ above the surrounding marsh, this flattened stone pillar is home to an oval pool of murky, viscous brown sludge (10’ x 3’).
	* 4 slim, slanted columns of polished basalt stand around the pool, one on each side.
		* When a sacrificial victim is tied to the 4 columns and the proper summoning rites performed, a worm of Qok (new) appears in the pool, eager to devour.
* If the heqeti are on alert, a random prisoner from 10-43 is tied to the columns while Cheksib the weaver summons a worm of Qok.
	* In a battle royale in 10-15 or upon the ziggurat, the worm of Qok first attempts to attack those in the northern marsh.  If none are present there, it mounts the least causeway (10-16) and moves to the ziggurat (10-32) to defend the fane of its lord.
	* Cheksib uses spells in support of the Great Tongue.

1 worm of Qok (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 12; HP 86; #AT 1; Dmg 2-24; MR 50%. Special attacks: swallow.

Prisoner from 10-43, to be determined randomly.

### 10-18: Upper Summoning Platform 

* Rising 55’ from the marsh, this flattened stone pillar is identical to the one at 10-17.
	* Alarm Raised: the heqeti weaver, Neepariq, will be present here, sacrificing a random victim from 10-43 in order to summon a worm of Qok.
	* No Alarm: the platform is empty.
* A long, slender, and steep staircase descends from this platform to the marsh.

1 worm of Qok (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 12; HP 86; #AT 1; Dmg 2-24; MR 50%. Special attacks: swallow.

Neepariq, heqeti weaver, as 12th-level cleric of Kauket (see 10-40)

Prisoner from 10-43, to be determined randomly.

### 10-19: High Bridge

* Soaring 55’ above the marsh, this 10’-wide, 3’-thick, damaged stone bridge connects 10-18 with the top level of the Ziggurat (10-35).
	* One section of the span was broken in antiquity; now spanned by rickety wooden planks.

### 10-20: Pilgrim’s Rest

* The largest structure in the great cavern outside of the ziggurat, heqeti pilgrims stop on this platform to take in the sights and make a small offering to Kauket.
	* The platform rises 25’ above the marsh, and was damaged in the wars of antiquity.
	* It is connected to the ziggurat by a bridge (10-21) and to the eastern chambers by a solid causeway.
	* The center of the platform has a low, raised pool, 18’ in diameter with a pair of 4’-tall copper statues (300 gp each) of erect salamanders with upturned mouths on either side.
		* Heqeti devotees approach the pool, perform ablutions, and deposit offerings of small gems into the mouths of the salamanders, after which they are free to enter the ziggurat.
			* The offering statues are periodically emptied into the treasury (10-53).  Currently there are 37 moderate gems (50 gp each) and 319 small gems (10 gp each)

* Unalerted
	* The platform is watched by a quartet of heqeti chosen (new) with long halberds. At any given moment 5-8 heqeti pilgrims are present on the platform.
* Alerted
	* 2 heqeti builders, 2 apprentices, and 10 hoppers guard the causeway.

### 10-21: Low Bridge

* This 20’-wide, 5’-thick bridge rises 25' above the Mephitic marsh, in relatively good shape.
	* It connects the 2nd level of the ziggurat (10-33) with the nearby pilgrims’ rest area (10-20).

### 10-22: Stair Fragment 

* A fragment of staircase that once connected to 10-20 rises from the marsh.
	* Solid stone and 10’ tall, liberally covered with acid drops and the glowing friend (flora).
	* It is a good location from which observe the ziggurat.

### 10-23: Pillar with Ledges 

* A pillar of stone rises to the ceiling here.
	* Two ledges are inset at a point 15’ above the marsh.
	* The flora has been carefully pruned back here to allow the heqeti to admire the ziggurat.
		* The northern ledge provides good sight lines overlooking the first step of the east face of the ziggurat.
	* Numerous heqeti sigils are carved into the side of the pillar. 
### 10-24: Platform of the Pukel

* A broad, low stone platform rises 5’ above the level of the marsh.
	* The pavement is cracked, pitted, and holed, abutting the great salamander head to the south (10-25).
	* This is the destination for all the heqeti teleport wells throughout Arden Vul, currently active or inoperative (i.e., 4-74, 6-106, 7-83, 8-25, 8-162, and SL5-32).

### 10-25: Giant Salamander Head

* A giant, carved, stone salamander head rises ominously, 25' above the Mephitic Marsh.
	* It resembles both the Great Pukel (9-40) and the colossal buried head (9-12): the head is rounded, with no ears, huge saucer-shaped eyes, a slit nose, and a gaping, 10' maw.  Its mouth is level with the nearby platform (10-24).
		* The lower lip juts forward from the mouth, allowing liquid to drip from the head and upper lip into the open maw.
		* The maw is filled with clear water, amid which glisten 9 pure white tears of Kauket (new).
	* The head is an extrusion of both Kauket and Rimmaq-Isfet on this plane.
		* It continuously oozes a viscous white liquid that drips into the water of the head’s maw, where it turns into tears of Kauket (5 / day, max 15 at a time).  If collected and drunk before it hardens into a tear, the liquid causes permanent madness.

### 10-26: Pillar with Ledge 

* Another natural pillar rises from floor to ceiling in here.
	* A small ledge is set into the pillar 10’ above the level of the marsh.
		* The ledge contains a battered memorial to the legionaries of the Archontean 10th Legion (“the Glorious Tenth”), a copper casket within a stone cairn.
			* Though corroded, it still has the legion's distinctive numeral X (10).
				* Within: a gladius +2, a cestus, a copper plaque, a scroll (Kentillian’s useful sphere, new), and an amulet of courage (see new magic items).
					* The plaque reads (Mithric) “In memory of our brothers and sisters in the Glorious Tenth, who died to cleanse this foul site.” (2,500 gp to the modern polemarch of the legion).
	* Pillar and ledge are heavily swathed in both the glowing friend and acid drops (flora).

### 10-27: Vantage Point 

* This broad platform set into the south wall of the cavern is 35’ above the level of the marsh.
	* It provides a fine view of the ziggurat, looming to the north.
	* A narrow set of stairs provides access to the marsh.
	* Once a gathering place for pilgrims in antiquity, the damage to the western precincts of the heqeti complex has left this area relatively unvisited.
	* Secret Door (south): opens simply by pushing inward.

### 10-28: Cistern

* The heqeti have walled off this portion of the great cavern with mortared round stones.
	* The run-off of the Rimpled Run (10-30 and 10-31) collects into this large cistern, which The heqeti use the cistern to modulate the amount of water in the Mephitic Marsh.
		* The retaining wall of the cistern is 10’ thick and 30’ tall; its top is flattened, allowing persons to walk along the top.
		* The water level is 15’ from the floor of the cavern. 
	* A sluice gate set into the retaining wall allows addition of water to the marsh.
		* The controls are atop the retaining wall; a simple wheel lever attached to a rope.
		* Given the size of the marsh, emptying the cistern does not seriously affect movement or the structures in the marsh.

### 10-29: Cistern Keepers’ Post

* 2 heqeti hoppers are stationed in this hidden perch overlooking the mephitic marsh (10-15).
	* They maintain the cistern (10-28) and watching the river and spillway (10-30).
	* They have a rope ladder attached to eyebolts set in the floor to descend to the cistern.
	* They sound the alarm with a spiral ibex horn in case of attack or if they spot intruders in the cistern.
	* The west wall is painted black, with a sinuous white tongue superimposed over it (a symbol of Rimmaq-Isfet).
* The post offers a fine vantage point from which to observe the ziggurat.
	* 1-4 hours spying can learn quite a bit about the heqeti population and activities.

2 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 24, 22; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to 
damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

### 10-30: Beach and Spillway

* A broad cave spans the Rimpled Run here.
	* The cave slopes down gently from south to north, making the northern bank a spillway for excess water from the Run.
		* Ordinarily the overflow is only to a small trickle that drips down the cliff into 10-28. Significant changes to the water flow (see 9-65) cause the trickle to grow to a flood, affecting the water level at 10-28.
	* A limed over ring of swimming is encrusted into the stone along the south bank of the Rimpled Run (detect as secret door).
* Secret Door (west): opens by pushing it open (open doors).

### 10-31: Rimpled Run, from 9-141

* The Rimpled Run emerges from level 9 (9-141) here.
	* That section of the underground river is vigorous and dangerous, entirely water-filled (see 9-141 for risks of traveling from that location).
	* Those who navigate the Run find that it slows considerably in this section, allowing swimmers a chance to exit the river at 10-30 (3d6 under DEX to reach the beach).
	* The Rimpled Run continues for several miles before debouching into the Silent Sea, a vast underground lake forming a key portion of the Underearth.

## Level 10: 10-32 - 10-37 (The Ziggurat of Kauket)

* The massive and ancient ziggurat of Kauket is the dominant feature of Level 10.
	* First built out of huge blocks of granite 3,400 years ago, it has always served as a site for heqeti worship of the demon prince, Kauket.
	* The blocks are 10’x15’ in size, pitted, pebbled, and greasy from the blood of sacrifices and the passage of countless heqeti slimes.
	* The ziggurat has been damaged over the millennia, particularly on its lower steps, but is still basically intact.

* The ziggurat has four steps, the lowest rising 10’ above the swamp and each subsequent step climbing another 15’ (the top is thus 55' above the marsh).
	* the glow of fire emanates from the first and third steps (see below). 

Evil, Evil from the Dawn of Time!
* As a site of great and ancient evil, the entire ziggurat lies under a hallow spell (new).
	* Chaotic evil creatures gain +2 to all rolls (saves, ‘to hit’ rolls, etc.).  Those of all other suffer a -2 to all rolls.
	* If the upper heqeti temple (7-78) is cleansed of its evil (through use of a hallow spell), the hallow effect here on Level 10 is removed.
* It is possible to unhallow the ziggurat through the application of good-oriented divine rituals after the climactic battle.  Such rituals cost 20,000 gp and take 3 weeks.

A Climactic Battle!
* For those adventurers wishing to cleanse Arden Vul of the heqeti presence, an epic combat on and around the ziggurat is likely.
	* To prepare, the GM should consider the state of heqeti awareness of the PCs’s progress (see 9-79 and Level 10 introduction).
		* If expecting intruders, the heqeti leaders will have assumed fixed positions in the vicinity of the ziggurat, and be ready to repel the PCs with spells and summoned allies. The resulting combat may provide a suitably epic conclusion to many campaigns.
		* If the PCs have managed to approach Level 10 without alerting the heqeti to their presence, the ziggurat will provide a substantially easier challenge, as some of the heqeti leaders will be found elsewhere in the complex.
* Finally, GMs should also be aware that it is possible for the PCs to summon and fight Kauket himself!
	* The procedures for such a foolish action are described in the Level 10 introduction and in the text for 10-37.

### 10-32: Ziggurat of Kauket, First Step

* The first step of the great ziggurat, rising 10’ above the marsh, is the most badly damaged from previous wars.
	* It is accessed from 10-16 via a short, 5’ staircase.
	* Two doors on the west side of the step lead inward to 10-36.
	* The walls leading are densely carved with high-relief images of heqeti worshipping a strange salamander with elephant feet and human hands (Kauket).
	* 13'-tall, granite statues of slug-like beings occupy three of its four corners, each with a brazier with glowing red coals beside it.
		* The slug-like beings have two powerful hind legs and two arms that grip a spear, a mattock, or an axe.  The statues are finely carved, despite numerous lichen growths and pitting from age (900 gp each). 
		* The statues moan constantly in a low-pitched, eerie tone, rising and falling in volume, occasionally punctuated with a load croaking.
			* The heqeti assume this is Kauket speaking to them, but it is a simple, but very ancient, enchantment. 
			* If a good-aligned being approaches within 10’, a 12th level dispel magic emanates 20' radius (this can be shut down with a dispel magic).

* Unalerted
	* This step has 9-16 heqeti pilgrims milling about, admiring the ziggurat. 4 chosen will also be present, one posted by each of the doors to 10-36.
* Alerted
	* Nobody is present, but a troop of 8 chosen led by Pikaressa, the Second Tongue (10-49) will be hiding inside 10-36, bursting from the doors when intruders approach.

9-16 heqeti hopper pilgrims (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 31, 30, 29, 28, 28, 27(x3), 26(x3), 24, 23, 22, 22, 21; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. Possessions: halberd +1.

### 10-33: Ziggurat of Kauket, Second Step

* The second step rises 15’ above the first (25’ above the marsh) and suffered less damage in antiquity.
	* It is accessed either via stairs from 10-32 or the bridge (10-21) from 10-20.
	* A single door on the south wall leads inward to area 10-37.

### 10-34: Ziggurat of Kauket, Third Step

* The third step rises 15’ above the second and 40’ above the marsh.
	* It is accessed via a staircase from 10-33 (on the western side). 
	* 9'-tall bronze statues of heqeti with arms upraised, bowing towards the pinnacle of the ziggurat stand proudly at each corner, with a braziers glowing with red-hot coals.
		* Their workmanship is fairly crude (300 gp).
		* They are enchanted with a ‘delayed blast unholy word.’
			* As an action while anywhere on the ziggurat, the Great Tongue (10-47) can croak out a command to one of the four statues (1/day/statue) and it emits a deafening unholy word (radius 30’).
				* Weakening Rimmaq-Isfet by poison on Level 8 (see 8-76) causes these statues to lose their ability.
	* The walls are carved in a more restrained, but still impressive fashion: a 5’-tall band of carved images extends around the entirety of the top step, depicting a single, huge salamander surrounded by fawning heqeti.

* If Kauket is summoned, he appears atop the fourth step with 3 keqemandri servitors.

### 10-37: Ziggurat of Kauket, Sacrificial Chamber

* This second interior chamber of the heqeti ziggurat is accessible only from the door on the southern wall of the second step.
	* It leads to the sacrificial chamber and the true holy of holies for the ziggurat. 
* The octagonal chamber holds a 5’-tall stone pillar, atop which rests a copper bowl.
	* Blood from sacrifices slain on the fourth step (10-35) drips through holes o land in the bowl here.
	* Four of the eight walls are carved with half-relief sculptures.
		* The sharp ends of horns taken from bizarre or magical creatures are thrust into three of the sculptures, and a double-sized, pearl-white tear of Kauket (new) is thrust into the wide, open, and blood-stained end of each horn.

* Sculpture #1 (southwest)
	* Image: Kauket, stirring in the mud with his spear; barely visible are small, tadpole-like creatures wriggling in the mud.
	* Horn: A midnight black, straight demon’s horn (3’ long), with silver glyphs incised into it (475 gp). It is inserted into the mud at the feet of Kauket.
* Sculpture #2 (northwest)
	* Image: Kauket stands amid a crowd of heqeti hoppers; large tears fall from his eyes into the mouths of grateful followers.
	* Horn: A purple, curved, ram-like demon’s horn, albeit with unsettling incrustations across its 4’ length. The horn is thrust into Kauket’s heart.
* Sculpture #3 (northeast)
	* Image: Kauket leaps into battle, wielding an enormous spear; hordes of keqemandri and other demons follow him.

	* Horn: The horn is missing; if present it would be inserted into Kauket’s mouth.
		* The missing horn (in 5-95A) is pale green, with a broad spiral and with irregular tufts of black bristly hair growing from it.

Summoning Kauket
* Should the missing horn be inserted into the fourth sculpture, and blood poured into each of the horns, Kauket will manifest atop the ziggurat within 2-6 turns.
	* Reepsiq, the Great Tongue (10-47), is aware that the absence of the fourth horn prevents him from fully communing with, or summoning, Kauket, and he would give almost anything for its return.
	* The missing horn was taken by the rudishva when they cleansed the ziggurat millennia ago. Recognizing its importance, they stored it in a hidden vault (5-95A).
		* Information on the location of the vault and the horn is lost to all living beings; only the rudishva AIs can, if asked, confirm the horn’s existence and describe how to access it (see AIs at 6-27 and SL14-13). 

### 10-38: Hall of the Builders

* This 25’-tall chamber is dominated by an enormous carved heqeti head rising from a central pool.
	* The head is carved from a 20’-thick half-column of stone rising 15’ before branching into two slender (5’-wide) bridges connecting to the walls of the chamber.
	* It resembles the upturned maw of a heqeti hopper, with the bridges as tongues emerging from that maw.
	* A narrow entrance in the central column allows one to climb a spiral staircase to access the tongues/bridges.
	* The carved half-column is ancient, pitted and damaged in places, but still exudes the oily sheen of active heqeti habitations.
* A 5’-wide walkway circles the chamber 15’ above the floor.
	* It can be accessed by climbing, or via the tongues/bridges. 
	* 5'-high bas-relief panels along the walkway show a pictorial history of the heqeti occupation of Arden Vul.

Reepsiq, the Great Tongue

* Despite his kindly, slow-moving, avuncular appearance, Reepsiq is keenly intelligent and capable of moving with startling quickness and direction. 
* He loathes humans, and his goal is to expel humans and their ‘allies’ (by which he includes humanoids and even the varumani) from Arden Vul. 
* He reluctantly deals with the other evil Underearth races, allowing a modicum of trade to take place here (see 10-54), but he is at his core a xenophobe.

Qassapik
* Like his contemporary, the Great Tongue, Qassapik is a scarred veteran of countless ambushes, deceits, and betrayals. 
* While looking almost human, his heqeti nature is betrayed by a slit nose and the odor of burnt sugar that his sweat produces (the byproduct of a magical experiment). 
* Qassapik is fanatical in his devotion to Kauket and Rimmaq-Isfet, and constantly spurs Reepsiq to take bolder moves into Arden Vul. 
* His duties include training the weaver apprentices and advising the Great Tongue on all matters connected to arcane magic.

Peelstiv
* Personality
	* Alien, mysterious, difficult to read; she doesn’t understand human/heqeti personal space, and is constantly coming too close to interlocutors’ faces. 
* Reputation and/or relations with Factions
	* She is an unknown quantity. Given their ancient alliance with the kaliyani, the heqeti are familiar with kaliyani practice and interests; still, they do not know Peelstiv and thus mistrust her motives.
* Secret?
	* She is one of the most trusted and experienced agents from Lissak-Tol, and has been tasked by the eleven consortia to locate Tsilliv and the renegade heqeti of the twelfth consortium (see SL9). She poses as a trader, but is interested in any hint of news about the kaliyani traitors.

She has a distinctive look: she sports a stone-colored full length cloak with hood covering blood red leather armor and gear. In addition, her face and forehead are coated with ash-grey makeup punctuated only by blood red eyeliner and blood red ovals on her cheeks. She does not speak Archontean, but rather an archaic dialect of Thorcin. 
* Reputation and/or relations with Factions
	* The heqeti consider her god-possessed, and thus treat her with caution. Some would like to slaughter her out of hand due to the long enmity between humans and heqeti, but the leaders have ruled that the cult she follows makes her acceptable as a trader.
* Secret?
	* She is a representative of a reclusive cult of humans who fled the surface world 97 years ago so as to be free to worship the alien deity Mzingaloq (see Gods of Magae in the World of Archontos appendix). This cult slew a community of Svirfneblin and took the deep gnomes’s home for their own. They are xenophobic and highly paranoid, and only trade with other subterranean races out of necessity.
