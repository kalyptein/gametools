## Overview

This small sub-level is home to one of the most powerful and 
enigmatic of the denizens of Arden Vul, the reclusive techno-
sorcerer who calls himself Kerbog Khan. Originally an archmage 
and member of the Imperial Academy (see ‘collegia’ in the World 
of Archontos appendix), Kerbog Khan decamped to Arden Vul, 
where he discovered by chance an incalculable treasure: the 
unplundered medical pod of the Beacon (SL12-4). He established a 
small fortress-like compound next to the wreck, and spent decades 
plumbing its secrets.

 Eventually he found himself able to combine his magical skills 
with technological knowledge gleaned from the wreckage; these 
resulted in his creation of a series of automatons, ranging in size 
and shape from small dragonflies to medium-sized bipeds. The 
Khan’s true innovation came with his discovery of a process by 
which he can project his own consciousness into the automatons 
that he has created (provided the automatons carry a bit of his own 
blood). With the help of these automatons, the Khan has been 
exploring the Halls, plundering them selectively so as to further 
his interests in blood magic and automaton-creation. This process 
has also resulted in the Khan’s gradual self-transformation as he 
has grafted plasteel, metal, microphones, and other devices to his 
own body, all in an effort to make the ‘perfect combination of man 
and machine’. 

 The sub-level is based around a small lake, in which the lost 
medical pod of the Beacon rests. Kerbog Khan’s sanctum lies just 
to the north of the lake. Within that sanctum the Khan practices 
blood magic and is continually tinkering with his automatons. The 
rare visitors who locate this area typically end up bargaining with 
Kerbog Khan through the infamous ‘talking grill’ (SL12-16). The 
Khan is fond of bargaining, as it provides him with another means 
of exploring and acquiring the objects he craves; of course, as he is 
fond of reminding petitioners, all bargains must be ‘sealed in blood’. 
Due to his strange appearance, however, the Khan typically does 
not reveal himself to visitors; instead they hear only his strange, 
amplified voice, complete with its hisses, cracks, and metallic pops. 
Despite his strangeness and particular interests, the Khan remains 
an extremely powerful archmage; angering him is inadvisable, as 
he is a dangerous and intelligent opponent.

General Construction Notes
* Rudishva areas: SL12-4 to SL12-12
* Other areas: Kerbog Khan first delved areas SL12-16, SL12-17, SL12-19, SL12-20 to SL12-28 by magic; later he improved them with the aid of his automatons.
	* These halls are plainly worked and finished stone, with 10’ ceilings and stone doors.

Important NPCs
* Kerbog Khan, archmage and eccentric techno-sorcerer (SL12-25)

## Areas

### SL12-1: Watery Tunnel to 5-103

* This 15’ diameter tunnel is mostly filled with water (3’ of clearance above the water line), stretching 40’ before joining the pool at 5-103. 

### SL12-2: Kerbog Khan’s Pool

* The cave was formed by the impact the Beacon’s medical pod smashing into the mountainside.
* Much of this cave is filled with cold, clear water, 50’ deep in most places, with 25’ of air between the surface and the cave ceiling.  The pod is now mostly submerged (SL12-4).
	* In the ell (SL12-18), the cave ceiling is 45’ above the water.
	* A variety of blind cave fish and crustaceans call the pool home
	* The southern and eastern walls are covered with a softly-glowing, green phosphorescent fungus (edible, if unappetizing).
	* The pool's floor is littered with dozens of skeletal remains (mostly human, but some  goblins, varumani, and others).  The remains contain no metal (Kerbog Khan has carefully salvaged it all).

### SL12-3: Beach with Doorkeeper

* A rocky beach rises a few feet above the waterline of the adjacent pool.
* Set in the north wall of the cave is a strange orange wall and door (rudishva plasteel).
	* The door is locked (-15% to pick locks chances, Difficult).
* Next to the door stands the Doorkeeper, a unique automaton of Kerbog Khan (new).

The Doorkeeper: 
* When anything 3’ or taller comes within 10’ of the Doorkeeper, it begins swaying on its column, its weird ‘head’ flashes with light, and a magic mouth speaks.
	* The garrulous mouth wheezes in the manner familiar to those who have heard Kerbog Khan speak: stuttering, a series of clicks, repeated vowels and consonants, and a generally metallic-sounding tone.
	* The message is as follows:
		* “Greettttingzzz and welcom-m-m-ezzz to [click] the abo-o-o-de of Kerrrrbog Khan, greaaaaatesssst of wizzzardzz [click]. Vizzzitorrrrs mussst offerrr suitablllle someteenggggs of valu-u-u-ue [click] and mussst prepaaare to barrrrgain. Know that barrrggainzz musst be sssealed in bloooood. Deppozzittt your offerrrringzzz with the Door-oor-oor-keeeeperr.” 
	* (Text in ‘normal’ speech)
		* ‘Greetings and welcome to the abode of Kerbog Khan, greatest of wizards! Visitors must offer suitable somethings of value and must prepare to bargain. Know that bargains must be sealed in blood. Deposit your offerings with this Doorkeeper’.
	* This is an invitation for visitors to place objects of value into the box attached to the cylinder.
		* Kerbog Khan prefers metals of any sort, whether precious (gold, silver, platinum) or mundane (steel scraps, wires), but is also eager to acquire gems, potions, and scrolls.
		* The type and value of the offering affects any future negotiation with Kerbog Khan according to the following chart.
		* Should no offering be made, or should the offering be primarily biological (food, leather items, wood, etc.), the Doorkeeper relapses into silence (and the offerings can be retrieved). 
	* If the offering is suitable, a second magic mouth speaks and the Doorkeeper extends itself on its flexible columnar base and uses a hand (the star-shaped rod) to unlock the door’ leading to SL12-16.
		* “It izzz accept-ept-ept-abbble” (It is acceptable).
		* Once the door is unlocked, the offerings in the box tumble into the cylinder and cannot be retrieved without destroying the Doorkeeper.

	* GM Note: 15% chance that items offered by previous visitors have not yet been transferred to Kerbog Khan and remain inside the torso of the doorkeeper. If so indicated, these items should be determined randomly.

and electricity.

### SL12-4: Medical Pod of the Beacon: Exterior

* Resting on a rock ledge within the pool is the medical pod of the Beacon.
	* Originally a 120’ x 80’ x 30’ cylinder, the eastern end was crushed in the crash, killing all crew in the pod.
	* The exterior is dull, gray, triple-strength plasteel, festooned with freshwater weeds.
	* The nuclear reactor that powered most of the pod was also destroyed in the crash.
		* The interior is thus dark (no LED lighting), and powered doors, null-grav shafts, etc no longer function (with the exception of SL12-11).
	* The interior is sheathed in white plasteel (except as noted), and has an upper level (SL12-5 to SL12-9) and lower level (SL12-10 to SL12-15). 

GM Note
* The transponder beacons of the medical pod were destroyed in the crash, and the rudishva assumed was utterly destroyed.
* Kerbog Khan (SL12-25) was the first sentient being in several millennia to locate it. 

##### SL12-4a: Jagged Hole in the Medical Pod

* Access to the medical pod was originally through a door on its east end, but that section of the pod was destroyed in the crash. 
* The crash tore a jagged hole (3’ x 7’) in the exterior, atop the pod, one foot above the waterline of the pool, leading into SL12-5.

## Medical Pod, Upper Level

### SL12-5: Assistant Medical Officer’s Quarters

* The iris door has been forced, and stuck in a partly-open position.
* The chamber has been stripped of almost all furnishings.
	* Some jagged, orange, plasteel stumps protrude from the wall and floors suggesting where a bed, desk, closet, chair, and hanging light fixture once stood.
	* GM Note: Kerbog Khan long ago scavenged all plasteel and technology here.

### SL12-6: Chief Medical Officer’s Quarters 

* This chamber is identical to SL12-5, down to the partially-opened door and the stripped furnishings, with a few exceptions.
	* A black, wall-mounted monitor (4’x3’) is embedded in the wall opposite where the desk once stood.
		* Affixed to the (blank) monitor is a parchment message (Archontean): “Property of Kerbog Khan. Do not touch! This means you!” 
	* A handful of personal items belonging to the former occupant, Haddi-Yon, the chief medical officer.
		* A tattered, yellow, silk scarf
		* A plastic name plate reading “Haddi-Yon, Chief Medical Officer, the Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven” (a memento from a conference)
		* A laminated note from Haddi-Yon’s life-partner, Nean-Ri (Glyphik).
			* It praises Haddi-Yon’s service to the rudishva people, applauds his dedication to xenobiology, assures him that he will locate a new species, and warns him not to let his fascination with exotic predators lead him into danger.
		* The Khan ignored these items because they have no technological use.

### SL12-7: Inoperable Null-Grav Shafts

* Two eye-shaped holes (10’ x 5’) in the floor drop down 15’ to the lower level of the medical pod (SL12-10).
	* These holes are rimmed with 2” of grey-plasteel to prevent accidental entry.
	* Lacking power, the null-grav shafts no longer function.
* The eastern exit is blocked by the rock into which the medical pod crashed.
	* By the rock face are the headless, desiccated remains of a rudishva in an emerald green jumpsuit (Haddi-Yon, chief medical officer of the Beacon).

### SL12-8: Examination Room

* The iris door to this chamber is stuck partly open, with a 6”-diameter aperture (could be forced open).
	* Kerbog Khan visited this chamber in gaseous form and stripped the cabinets of their contents.
* Two 8’-long, 4’-tall solid plasteel tables stand in the center of the chamber.
	* The Khan missed one drawer in the base of an examination table.
	* 6 packages of saline solution, 3 hypodermic needles, 2 rolls of bandages, 2 pair of scissors, and a bottle of 20 ‘pep’ pills (tech).
* The walls are lined with built-in cabinets, open and empty.
* The floor is scattered with debris, mostly organic: rotted linen, plastic envelopes that have been torn open, etc.
	* Among the debris are skeletons of a rudishva and varuda; both without clothing. 

### SL12-9: Examination Room

* The iris door to this chamber has been broken into bits; access is free and easy.
* The chamber is cut almost completely in half by a rock wall by the crash.
* The chamber is identical to SL12-8, including debris, but without medical supplies.

## Medical Pod, Lower Level

### SL12-10: Inoperable Null-Grav Shafts

* Two eye-shaped holes (10’x5’) are set into the ceiling 15’ above the floor, leading to the upper level of the medical pod (SL12-7).
	* These holes are rimmed with 2” of grey-plasteel to prevent accidental entry.
	* Lacking power, the null-grav shafts no longer function.
* The chamber is almost cut in half by the rock wall, thus preventing access to the east. 

### SL12-11: Operating Theater

* GM Note: this is the exact kind of thing the kaliyani are searching for.  It's presumed destruction was a big impediment to the rudishva living up to their end of the alliance.  The heqeti would also love to find it, as it could dramatically enhance their disease and slime capabilities.

* The iris door to this chamber is stuck in a partly open position, with a 3’ aperture.
	* The glowing runes of a symbol of fear appear on the door.
	* The chamber inside is lit by the ship's lighting.
* The chamber is divided into three areas.
	* The operating theater's backup micro-reactor means it is still operational.
	* Just opposite the doorway is the actual operating theater.
		* In the center is 10’x4’ plasteel table mounted on a ball joint atop a hydraulic pillar.  Four articulated surgical arms with various tools on their tips (scalpel, tweezers, clamps, injector) stand around the table.
			* Strapped to the table is a true varumani named Gevorda.
			* Surrounding the table and arms is a hemisphere of pellucid, semi-rigid, mutable gel known as medicaderm (tech).
		* North of the table and medicaderm shield is a 4'-high bank of consoles.
			* At the console is the Giatros, a unique automaton (new).
	* To the north and south are sterile recovery suites, separated from middle by an opaque plasglass wall, with access via an iris door.
		* Opens to a sky blue or better rudishva identity plaque.
		* Inside is an antechamber, with console for monitoring patients.
		* The antechamber is separated from the actual recovery suite by a second wall of medicaderm.
		* Northern Suite: the medicaderm wall failed in the crash, and Kerbog Khan stripped all equipment and furnishings from it years ago.
		* Southern Suite: still functional, and still contains a ‘patient’.
			* The console that controls the suite is also operative, as Kerbog Khan did not dare to release the patient held within.
			* The patient is actually a huge space squid that had been captured by the Beacon and placed here for study; it has been kept comatose for millennia, but can be released through ill-advised manipulation of the console here, in the southern recovery suite, or of the console by the surgical theater. 

Inhabitants
* The Khan summoned two invisible stalkers and tasked them with slaying anyone unauthorized who enters the theater.
* When entered, the invisible stalkers move to attack.
* Initially, the Giatros remains at its post, but has a 20% per round of joining the fray.
	* Once the Giatros enters combat, there is a 10% chance per round Kerbog Khan inhabits the Giatros.  This has no effect other than the Khan shouting imprecations and commands at the interlopers.
		* If the Khan inhabits the Giatros during battle, he will clearly know that the PCs are responsible for disturbing his special research area and will intractably refuse to aid the PCs thereafter.  He may (25%) send a battle automaton after them at some point.
		* If Kerbog Khan does not inhabit the Giatros, there is a chance he won't know of the PCs’ culpability (base 66%, modified by the GM judgement).
			* If the PCs boast of their discoveries in this chamber, of course, the Khan will know the PCs’ ‘guilt’ and will refuse all further interaction.

Using the Surgical Theater Console
* The medicaderm shield is pellucid but spongy; standing outside it, one can push it inwards toward the table, interacting with a patient without compromising the sterile environment within.
	* Medicaderm was a major scientific invention.  It can transmit vital signs from patients that it touched to the medical consoles, and transfer drugs and treatments directly through the patient’s dermis.
* An operator can use the consoles to manipulate the operating theater.
	* The surgical table can be raised, lowered (3’ into the floor), and tilted, surgical arms can be controlled, density and activity of the medicaderm can be adjusted (e.g., permeable, to allow patients to be placed within the theater) and used to administer treatments through the medicaderm.
	* Those unable to read Glyphik have a 1% chance to decipher the console.  Roll on the table to determine what their manipulations accomplish.
	* Those who read Glyphik have a 50% chance to successfully use the console to for a particular goal, and can select what they wish to do (then roll if the attempt fails).
* The theater automatically detects and comprehends the physiology of rudishva and varuda (and other life native to their homeworld).
	* It can learn new biology through exposure (1d3 manipulations, each with 33% chance of fatal mishap).
	* Via the Khan's use, it has learned human biology, and can extrapolate biologies such as that of elves (human + rudishva) and varumani / trollkin (human + rudishva biotech).
	* Mi'it, kaliyani, heqeti, and other local races are unknown.

### SL12-12: Sick Ward

* The north and east walls are lined with built-in plasteel bunks (5 stacks of 3 high), where sick crewmen recovered from minor ailments.
* The south wall has built-in cabinets, but Kerbog Khan stripped them of all usable items.
* 4’ above the floor of the sick ward the external wall of the medical pod has been eaten away by some caustic substance, leaving a 5' hole to a similarly-sized tunnel.
* A breach in the east wall led to another sick ward, but that chamber is almost completely filled with rock, its contents utterly crushed (if may hint at the existence of SL12-15, it's mirror on the north side of the pod).

### SL12-13: Tunnels leading to 4-175a and to 6-161a

* 4’ above the floor of the sick ward the external wall of the medical pod has been eaten away by some caustic substance, leaving a 5’ diameter hole leading to a perfectly round tunnel.
	* The hole was bored by Kerbog Khan’s borer automaton (SL12-19).
	* The tunnel descends in wide spirals to Level 6 (6-161a), the slope steep, but gentle enough to allow bipeds to traverse without slipping (3x difficult terrain).
* 20’ down from the entry is a 2.5’-wide crack in the tunnel wall which opens into a natural, rough tunnel roughly 4’ in diameter.
	* This tunnel descends gently over a very long distance to 4-175a.

### SL12-14: Sick Ward

* This room is identical to area SL12-12, save for the skeletal remains of two varuda heaped in the center.

### SL12-15: Sick Ward 

* This chamber is inaccessible from the rest of the wreck of the medical pod.
	* Only enterable if holes are knocked through the plasteel walls of SL12-14 or SL12-8.
	* Kerbog Khan does not know it exists; informing him of its existence would win his favor, if not looted first.
* The chamber is identical in layout to SL12-12 and SL12-14.
	* Thanks to its isolation, the chamber is dry.
	* Remains of two jump-suit clad rudishva crewmen are dashed against the east wall.
		* Rust plastic rudishva identity plaque
		* Brown plastic rudishva identity plaque; communication bracelet, 2 full lesser power supplies.
	* In cabinets or scattered on the floors are various items.
		* 3 anti-venom kits; a biohazard suit; a fire extinguisher; a GnuCoder 1000 image screen; 5 instant heat sources; 4 full lesser power supplies; 2 containers of ‘pep’ pills (20 pills each); 10 Arden Vul cakes; and 3 bottles of rudishva aquavit.

## Kerbog Khan's Workshop

### SL12-16: Hall of Bargains

* Access to this chamber is difficult. 
	* From the south the way is barred by the plasteel wall and door.
		* Can be unlocked by the Doorkeeper (SL12-3), picked (-15%, Difficult), or beaten down (lift gates -35%).
	* From the east, a portcullis located near the bridge (SL12-18) bars the way.
	* The lever used to raise the portcullis is found on the south wall of this hall. 
	* A lever for raising the portcullis by the entrance to SL12-19 is also located on the south wall.
* The chamber is undecorated stone, with a steel grill set into the north wall.
	* The grill is 2’ wide by 1’ tall, 5’ above the floor, made of 1” bars of steel welded together.
		* It is securely latched on the opposite side (SL12-23), but can be opened to allow objects to be passed through.
	* Four of Kerbog Khan’s automatons stand in the corners of the chamber.
		* Two battle automatons (50% chance for a third), an exploration automaton, and a unique automaton, the Nosokoma.
		* All four are quiescent until attacked, or until ordered to take action by Kerbog Khan.

Bargaining With Kerbog Khan
* Once donations have been accepted by the Doorkeeper (SL12-3), petitioners proceed to the grate for conversation and bargaining with Kerbog Khan.
* Barring unusual circumstances (i.e., the PCs attack his automatons, or are known to have intruded into his research lair at SL12-11), the Khan begins negotiation in a neutral state, willing to bargain, provided he gets what he wants and can offer something in return.
* The broad shape of negotiations is determined by a standard reaction roll, with the following modifiers:

Category Factor Modifier to Reaction Roll
* Donations Nature and value of donation
	* See SL12-3
* Information on offer from PCs
	* High interest to Kerbog Khan +10%
	* Moderate interest to Kerbog Khan 0%
	* Low interest to Kerbog Khan -5%
* Additional Items on offer from PCs
	* Working rudishva technology +5 to +15%
	* Broken rudishva technology +1 to +8%, depending on size and rarity
	* Rudishva plasteel, wiring, springs, etc. +1%/square foot
	* Lesser magic items (potions, scrolls) +2% each
	* Major magic items +5 to +10% each
* Demeanor of PCs
	* PCs are deferential +10%
	* PCs are respectful but distant 0%
	* PCs are mocking or hostile -20%

Possible Information or Services Offered by Kerbog Khan
* The Khan almost never offers objects to petitioners; his side of any bargain is information or services.
* The Khan always requires bargains be ‘sealed with blood’; the PCs must provide a sample of their own blood, to be collected by his unique automaton (the Nosokoma).

Map Knowledge
* Knowledge of most of the generally accessible areas of Arden Vul; except the Midnight Road areas of Level 5, the areas of Level 8 afflicted with bliss pollen, all areas concealed behind secret doors, all of SL-11, etc.
* He also is aware of many exits from Arden Vul, especially those on levels 1-6.

Faction Knowledge
* The Khan knows the power structures of all the major factions of Arden Vul (goblins, beastmen, varumani, heqeti), and can describe rulers and their general proclivities.
* He does not know secrets (e.g., he is ignorant of the true nature of the Master of the Sun-Scarred Knights).

Historical Knowledge
* He knows a lot about the rudishva, about the history of the varumani, about the Archonteans and their demise, and about many of the inhabitants of the Halls.
* He also has a chance to know the location of other adventuring parties. 

Healing Services
* Kerbog Khan has mastered rudishva drugs that will cure most diseases and wounds. Effectively he can offer the technological equivalent of a cure light wounds, cure serious wounds, or a heal spell, as administered by the Nosokoma.

Spell Services
* As an archmage, the Khan can cast most magic user spells.

Teleportation Services
* The Khan regularly offers this service, especially to lost or badly wounded parties.
* The Khan accomplishes teleportation through his automatons; those being teleported must touch the automaton that the Khan is inhabiting before the Khan, through the automaton, casts the spell.
* The automaton is transported with the party, which may limit the Khan’s willingness to teleport parties to certain locations.

General
* The Khan is deeply interested in rudishva technology and history, and is eager to acquire information about the rudishva and/or objects produced by them.
* He is also interested in ancient Archontean constructs, in unusual spells or magic items, and in hitherto-secret information about the denizens of the Halls.
* Given his network of dragonflies and exploration automatons, he will be unwilling to trade for mundane stuff or information.

### SL12-20: Stairs Up to 3-22a

* Uneven and rough stairs climb 200’ up through several changes of direction and landings before ending at the secret door in the catacombs of Thoth (3-22a). 
* Halfway up the stairs is the corpse of Asrotelion, a mage sent by the Collegium of Cinders to locate Kerbog Khan.
	* Asrotelion was clever enough to use blood magic (Kerbog Khan’s specialty) to try to track the Khan, but ran afoul of poison dragonflies on this staircase.
	* He is now a wraith, haunting his corpse (ignoring the unliving automatons).
		* It hugs the ceiling of the stairwell, gaining +2 to surprise.
	* On the corpse
		* A platinum signet ring (175 gp); silver scroll case (10 gp) with scrolls of locate object, invisibility, and locate living being (new)
		* 6 darts; a staff

### SL12-21: Tunnel Down to 8-54

* This circular tunnel is 5’ in diameter and boasts perfectly smooth walls.
	* It spirals, with a slope just gentle enough to allow bipeds to climb without slipping (3x difficult terrain).
	* It descends about 1,050’ before exiting at8-54.
* The tunnel was made by Kerbog Khan’s specialized automaton, the borer (SL12-19).
	* 20% chance the automaton is performing routine scraping maintenance in the tunnel; 50-50 chance it is moving toward or away from the party.
		* If moving towards the party, its cutting blades do an automatic 2d8 damage/rd to whomever is directly in front of it.
			* Combat is difficult in the tunnel (-4 to hit).
			* If the characters are ‘below’ the borer (i.e., climbing from 8-54 while the borer descends), PCs must roll under DEX to avoid losing their footing (rocketing down the tunnel for 4d6 damage when they emerge at 8-54).
		* If moving away from the party, it poses no hazard. 

Borer automaton of Kerbog Khan (20%): see SL12-19 for stats.

### SL12-22: Dragonfly Tunnels

* These 1’-diameter tunnels have utterly smooth walls.
	* They lead from the hallway near SL12-25 to both the pool (SL12-2) and the access tunnels to the upper halls (SL12-20) and nether reaches (SL12-21).
* The tunnels provide egress from the workshops for Kerbog Khan’s dragonflies (SL12-28).

### SL12-23: Hall of Heads 

* A marble half-column rises 5’ from the floor in the center of this small chamber.
	* Atop it, facing the grill (to SL12-16), is an ever-alert head (new) created from the remains of a true varumani.
		* It is imbued to detect invisibility and detect alignment.
		* The head sounds an alarm when visitors appear in the Hall of Bargains.  This brings Kerbog Khan within five rounds, ready to bargain.
	* The walls of the chamber are filled with a hodgepodge of different shelves, all of which are filled with heads.
		* Most (30) are from ancient Archontean statues of various materials (granite, marble, bronze), worth 6-600 gp each.
		* 5 are heads of heqeti statues (40-400 gp each).
		* Several are magical heads: a head of Thoth, an infernal effigy, an obsidian skull of comprehension, and, in a burlap sack, a shrunken head (all new). 
			* Head of Thoth: contains the personality of Paratus Vitriunius, a logothete (Kerbog Khan finds his information of little practical value).
			* Infernal effigy: brass devil head, keyed to the devil Naboremask, a powerful pit-fiend in service to Asmodeus (the Khan knows its name, but out of caution has only contacted the devil once).
			* The shrunken head: talks constantly about either numerous nasty ways to kill people, or the glories of the summer garden of Trendax the Grey, a wizard with a tower near Arcturos.
			* Obsidian skull: grapefruit sized, vaguely diabolic.
		* A wooden chest sits under the shelving.
			* Holds 13 fish-shaped control rods for the eggs found at area 4-85.

### SL12-24: Blood Bank

* The door to this chamber is cool to the touch.
* The chamber is cold (~45-degrees) and low-ceilinged (6’ tall).
	*  To the south, a wooden table and chair stand atop a bearskin rug, with two sheepskin dusters draped over the chair.
		* On the table is a crystal ball and a 2’-diameter lump of arcanum.
			* A vial-sized slot has been carved in the arcanum, allowing Kerbog Khan to insert one of his vials of blood into the lump.
			* Possession of a sample of blood from an individual allows perfect scrying (100% chance of locating) with all additional features (clairaudience, ESP, and telepathy).
	* To the north is Kerbog Khan’s blood bank; wooden boxes stuffed with sawdust holding vials of blood taken from those who bargain with him.
		* Samples are preserved in vials, with the name of the giver recorded on the vial. 
	* Two volleyball-sized spheres of granite rest on the floor before the blood bank.
		* These cold rocks (new) keep the chamber cold and the blood samples fresh.
		* The Khan has expended considerable time and energy attempting to preserve blood samples, but hasn't been able to keep them viable longer than a decade.

Encountering Kerbog Khan
* Kerbog Khan will be encountered mostly at the bargaining grill separating SL12-16 from SL12-23.
* If attacked there, he will retreat to marshal his resources.
	* Unless the PCs seem capable of breaching the grill, he will cautiously wait for them to tire themselves out and leave.
	* If deemed capable of breaching his inner defenses, he returns with all his resources: i.e., with his staff of the magi, statuette of faithful service, and spell buffs.
	* It might be possible to surprise Kerbog Khan here, in his actual sanctum (by sneaking through the dragonfly tunnels); the Khan will be visibly upset but still attempts negotiation.
	* If assaulted or if negotiation fails, he teleports away to 3-174 to regroup. 

Kerbog Khan’s Story
* Kerbog Khan was born Cerbactos Kalthetos, son of a wealthy spice merchant in Archontos. Once his arcane gift was identified, his father secured a place for him in the Imperial Academy, the most socially prominent of the collegia. Cerbactos rose swiftly through the ranks, proving himself an extremely talented wizard.  By his early 50s he was an archmage, his advice occasionally sought by the imperial court itself.
* One day 57 years ago (in 2936 AEP), however, Cerbactos disappeared, apparently taking with him six rare codices stolen from the library of the Imperial Academy.  Cerbactos ventured into Arden Vul, taking the name Kerbog Khan in the process. He spent over a decade exploring, usually invisibly and secretly.
* Finally he made an extraordinary discovery: the un-looted medical pod of the Beacon. This pod had remained untouched for millennia, as the rudishva considered it lost and never bothered to look for it. As a result it held significant scientific and technological treasures.
* The resources of the medical pod dovetailed precisely with Kerbog Khan’s own interest in blood-magic, constructs, and techno-sorcery. He delved a small work-shop next to the medical pod, and began experimenting.
* He was successful in part thanks to his own intelligence, interests, and magical talents, but in part also due to the six codices that he had stolen from Archontos. He was able to pioneer new and unsettling fusions of mechanical and biological entities. While other magi may have created constructs, the Khan’s great achievement was his ability to ‘inhabit’ them from afar, so long as a blood connection was maintained (hence the fact that all of his constructs hold a small vial of his blood).
* Obsessed with his automatons, with the rudishva technology that partly enabled them, with his own genius, and with a desire to live forever, Kerbog Khan also began experimenting on his own body. He decided that true immortality could be achieved by adding mechanical parts to his own body. His body is now more than 75% mechanical, a pastiche of rudishva plasteel, tempered Archontean steel, wiring, and exotic precious metals.
* As his transformation proceeded, his empathy, morality and general sense of his own humanity withered; he withdrew increasingly into his workshop, preferring to let his automatons interact with the rest of Arden Vul. He now prefers to interact through the grill at SL12-23, thus shielding petitioners from the sight of his strange body. His voice, as filtered through a rudishva microphone, sounds mechanical, and his speech is punctuated by cracks, pops, whirrs, and stuttered consonants. Despite his strangeness, however, Kerbog Khan is still a formidable magic user.

### SL12-27: Privy

* This chamber smells of excrement.
* A hole in the floor leads down 30’ to an unmapped cave.  Every spring, water seeps into that cave, filling it several feet deep. It leeches out over the next month, taking much of the filth with it.

### SL12-28: The Workshops of Kerbog Khan

* A 15’-tall, rough-hewn chamber used for Kerbog Khan’s magical and mechanical experimentation.
	* Brightly lit with continual light spells.
* East (Protective Diagrams)
	* Two 12’-diameter diagrams incised in the floor and filled with silver and glass chips
		* A magic circle (for devils) and a pentagram (for other evil creatures).
		* Between the circles is a chest.
			* Rare unguents, dusts, and other summoning materials (325 gp).
* Center-East (Automaton Construction)
	* Four large work-benches in a square around an open work area.
		* In the work area is a 10’-square, upright scaffold of plasteel from which hangs the incomplete torso of a bipedal exploration automaton (new).
		* Scattered about the workbenches are piles of plasteel plating, plasteel tubing, lengths of wiring, and a wide array of tools.
			* Ordinary tools:  carving knives, screwdrivers, hammers, mallets, chisels, and clamps.
			* Rudishva tools: soldering iron w/ spool of solder, industrial stapler, portable cutting tool, lesser welding tool (see the ‘industrial tools’ in tech).
* Center-West (Forge and Materials Storage)
	* A small forge holding a small summoned fire elemental.
		* The Khan is not a talented smith, but he uses the forge for melting metals and forming small parts from steel and iron.
	* Stacked near the forge are 200 board-feet of lumber pillaged from the Halls.
	* Two battered wooden chests hold chunks of steel and iron.
	* Leaning against the south wall are several large (5’x10’) sections of plasteel in various colors (orange, grey, etc.).
	* A dozen kegs and barrels hold wine, water, and ale.
* West (Reading Area and ‘Children’)
	* A thick plush carpet depicts a flying dragon (250 gp).
	* A comfortable leather chair and a table with a rudishva GnuCoder 1000 image screen and a scattering of rudishva data crystals (see books).
		* The Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven: Technical Specifications of this Yort-Class Exploration Vessel
		* Crew Roster (Medical)
		* Service Manual for Optical Devices produced by GnuCoder S.A.
		* Voyages of the Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven
		* Biological Systems: an Owner’s Manual
		* Injury and Disease: Practical Solutions
		* Specimen XRF-6013: Notes by Haddi-Yon, Chief Medical Officer.
	* Standing quietly by the chair are two of the Khan’s most prized automatons, his “Children”, Muhuli and Phoebe.
		* They are sentient, and devoted to their ‘father’ (Kerbog Khan).  Curious to meet new ‘friends’ of their father, they grow distressed if he is criticized.
		* If convinced that their father is gone for good, they imprint onto the highest charisma PC, following and importuning them constantly for attention, love, and favors.
	* Under the table is the sole surviving rudishva power supply charger from the Beacon.
		* Next to it is a greater power supply (245 hours remaining) and 16 freshly-charged lesser power supplies.

Repairing Robots from Elsewhere in the Halls
* With his facility with automatons and expansive knowledge of rudishva technology, Kerbog Khan has a chance to repair and reprogram malfunctioning rudisha military-grade security constructs.
	* These could include the partially-functioning constructs Gethe (6-16), Haine (6-84), and Ranke (SL10A-16) and the currently inoperative constructs Stiller (6-36) and Dronke (SL10A-20).
	* Requires 4-6 months labor, 15,000 gp of precious metals and gems, and 3 cubic feet of rudishva technological detritus (wires, circuit boards, etc.).
	* At the end of such a period, the Khan’s base chance to have restored the construct to full operationality is 75% for Gethe, Haine and Ranke, and 40% for Stiller and Dronke.
		* +5% for each construct the Khan has previously studied (regardless of repair outcome); +15% for each construct successfully restored.
	* Kerbog Khan will be unwilling to allow restored constructs to leave his service, regardless of bargains struck.
		* Consider the Khan’s previous interactions with PCs when determining if the Khan will allow such a valuable (and dangerous) resource to escape his clutches.
		* Favor could include: provision of additional constructs to the Khan; providing access to the bridge or the shuttle bay of the Beacon (e.g., SL-14 and SL13-37).
