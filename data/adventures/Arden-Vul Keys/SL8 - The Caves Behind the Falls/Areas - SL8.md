## Overview

Behind the great waterfall that cascades down the cliff face of Arden Vul lies a small and almost unknown network of caves. In antiquity the temple of Set used these caves to develop and breed the several species of the Set animals (see new monsters) that are 
holy to Set.

The modern cult rediscovered the cave system about fifteen years ago and is attempting to revive the breeding of Set animals. They have been stymied by their ignorance of the specifics and extent of the old breeding program, as well as by the fact that they have been unable to discover the old breeding labs (areas SL8-17 to SL8-23) due to the major tunnel collapse at area SL8-10.  As a result, their efforts have been fairly limited, producing only some lesser specimens in the areas SL8-5 and SL8-7.

They are unaware of the fact that access to the old facilities and to an independent strain of greater Set animals is still possible, but only if one is able to traverse the underwater tunnels of area SL8-6.

General Construction Notes
* Archontean areas: SL8-9, SL8-13A, SL8-17 to SL8-24

Factions
* Although the Set cult is the only faction aware of this sub-level, it does not yet fully control the region.

Access and Egress
* To Exterior: cave at SL8-1, leading to the cliff face at EX-16
* To Level 4: stairs at SL8-19, leading up to 4-162 
* To Sub-Level 9: ledge at SL8-15, leading down to SL9-1
* To Sub-Level 13: stairs at SL8-24, leading down to SL13-29

## Sub-Level 8: 1 - 24

### SL8-1: Cave in the Cliff Face (aka EX-16)

* Hidden behind the waterfall that pours down the cliff face of Arden Vul is this small cave.
	* Only 15’ wide, the cave entrance is slick with spray. The waterfall is deafening. The cave hidden from the valley floor, and extremely difficult to find (as secret door) even for those flying or hovering in front of the Falls.
	* The cave is 450’ above the valley floor, 1050’ below the level of the plateau.
	* A narrow path (2’ wide) hugs the cliff face as it descends from EX-14 and disappears behind the waterfall, connecting to this cave.
		* At EX-14, 1-in-6 chance (3-in-8 for rangers) to notice the path.
		* Navigating it requires 4d6 under DEX or slip and fall (thieves auto-succeed).  Roping together improves the roll to 3d6 under DEX, with -1 per roped thief. 
		* Emerging from the cave (via SL8-2), it is easy to spot the narrow path to EX-14.
	* Entering from the exterior, the cave opening quickly narrows into a tunnel that slopes steeply downward.
		* After 30’ the tunnel ends in a stone door (12th-level wizard locked).
			* A large key-hole is evident (-10% to pick).
			* Ten keys to the lock were made.
				* The locations of four are known to the cult of Set (4-47, 4-51, 4-56, 4-57); the other six are thought lost (they are at: AV-29, 4-2 (see Meral the Key-monger), 4-142, 5-30, 6-138, and 7-76c).

### SL8-2: Guardian Constructs

* Two archontean animated constructs, jackal-headed humans carrying stone axes, stand in this flattened and widened tunnel.
	* They attack anyone who does not present a holy symbol of Set.
	* They pursue fleeing intruders to the stone door at SL8-1 and into SL8-5, but cannot fit into SL8-4 or the tunnel leading to SL8-3.

2 Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 38, 35; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.

### SL8-3: Supply Caves

* The modern Set cult has established a supply depot in this lobed cave.
	* Western lobe: 3 nailed crates holding dried vegetables, sacks of ground meal, and dried meats.
	* Southern lobe: 6 javelins, 3 ‘man-catcher’-style devices, four 15’x15’ weighted nets, a pair of bespoke, rigid, boiled-leather suits (AC 6, but with MV 30’).
		* The boiled-leather suits are for handling the Set animals (to avoid their stings).
	* A locked iron case (3’x1’x1’) contains three smoke pots.
		* When lit, these devices emit a narcotic gas: save vs breath or half speed and -2 to all rolls for 1 hour.

### SL8-4: Watery Tunnel

* This narrow (4’-wide) tunnel slopes down steeply.
	* The final 20’ of it are filled from floor to ceiling with water.
	* A lime-encrusted skeleton of an ancient Set priest lies within the water, just before the tunnel enters area SL8-6b.
		* He was involved in the ancient cult’s Set animal breeding program.
		* His skull was crushed by a heavy, blunt object (see note at SL8-8).
		* His equipment is gone, save for a broken deacon’s was stick (new).

### SL8-5: Set Animal Cave

* This 35’-tall cavern is marked by two twisting rock pillars that rise from floor to ceiling.
	* The floor is uneven, with many dips, projections, and folds.
	* Six Set animals race around the cavern, chasing a pair of goats under the uneasy eyes of a pair of Set guardsmen. 

6 Set animals (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LE; AC 5; MV 150’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 11; #AT 2; Dmg 1-4/1-6; MR 25%. Special attacks: venom; jump; confusion; dispel magic 1/day.

2 goats: SZ M; AL N; AC 7, MV 150’; HD 1+2; HP 7; #AT 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: charge.

2 Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 2nd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 17, 12; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow). Special defense: fanaticism. Possessions: red scale mail and wooden shield; footman’s maces; spears; light crossbows with 20 bolts.

### SL8-6: Tripartite Pool

* This pool has three separate areas connected by tunnels.
	* The water is cold and slightly opaque due to sediment and the activity of the Set animals.  All three sections of the pool are 40’ deep.
	* The tunnel between SL8-6a and SL8-6b lies 20’ below the water's surface
	* The other two tunnels (from SL8-6a to SL8-6c and SL8-6b to SL8-6c) are 30’ below.
	* The modern Set cult is unaware of the underwater tunnels.

### SL8-7: Set Animal Cave

* This 30' high cave is riddled with holes, folds, and projections, save for a flattened area at area SL8-9.
	* The modern Set cult is using this site to try to breed Set animals.
		* Given the apparent lack of fertility of any of the summoned Set animals, High Priestess Stephania (4-51) has sent a Set deacon and a pair of acolytes to see if they can iron out the bugs in this program.
		* These priests, along with four Set guardsmen, are nervously watching one greater and six Set animals hunt and torment a bewildered giant lizard.
		* If combat breaks out, the Set animals are just as likely to attack the Set priests and guardsmen as the PCs.
		* Unbeknownst to the Set priests and guardsmen, Stephania will not let her minions depart these caves lest they reveal the existence of the breeding program.

1 giant lizard: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 150’; HD 3+1; HP 11 (max 20); #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: double damage on a natural 20 to hit.

Special defense: fanaticism. Possessions: red scale mail and wooden shield; footman’s maces; spears; light crossbows, 20 bolts.

### SL8-8: Ledge and Cave with Forgotten Corpse

* A ledge 5’ below the ceiling of area SL8-7 leads to a 10’-tall, nondescript side cave.
	* An ancient corpse lies mostly concealed beneath a scattering of rock and dust.
		* It wears Set armor +1 (av items) and the ring of Set known as Lorica (new).
		* Beside it are a mace, the fourth lantern from SL8-9, and a rotted leather purse.
			* Purse: 65 ancient silver pennies, 3 white pearls (100 gp each), a 3”-long, tarnished copper message tube containing an ancient parchment.
				* Secret tongue of Set: “To Julianus, loyal priest, from Laurellik, son of Set and High Priest of Arden Vul. You are to eliminate all loose ends in the breeding program. Eliminate all other administrators of the program; how you do it is of no concern to me. Merely ensure that no witnesses remain. Secure the brood-mother and remove Lorica from the fool Hecurion’s finger, and bring them with you to the outer door on the eve of the feast of Arden. There you will be met by my personal guard, who will escort you to my side. Tell no one.”
				* High Priestess Stephania would pay 3,000 gp for the return of Lorica.

GM Note
* The corpse is Julianus, private agent of Laurellik, the last high priest of Set before the Archontean retreat.
* Laurellik ordered Julinaus to ‘clean’ the breeding program by killing all the priests.
* Julianus was mostly successful (the corpse of the head of the breeding program, Hecurion, is at SL8-11, where Julianus slew him).
* Unfortunately for Julianus, no one ever met him at area SL8-1 on the eve of the feast of Arden, and he was slain here by the very brood-mother Set animal that he was transporting.
* Aside from this history, the note hints at the existence of a formal laboratory deeper within the caves (see SL8-16 to SL8-23).

### SL8-9: Ancient Pavilion 

* A 20’x20’ section of the cave floor has been flattened, and a large summoning circle incised into the center of the flattened area.
	* At each corner of the pavilion stands a thick, 5’-diameter and 5’-tall stone half-column, from the top of each of which extends an iron shepherd’s crook.
		* From three of the four crooks hangs a lantern (magical).
			* No way to open / refuel them.  The bottom of each is inscribed (secret tongue of Set) “Bring divine light so as to protect the faithful.”
				* Casting light or continual light (lasts 2x duration of light, not continual) on a lantern powers it while the spell lasts.
				* When all four lanterns are hanging in place, a ward encircles the pavilion, excluding all (creature, missile, spell) from outside, but allowing those inside to shoot, cast, etc out.
			* The fourth lantern is at SL8-8.
			* The modern Set cult is ignorant of the lanterns’ function. 
	* Four stone benches, carved to resemble crocodiles, surround the summoning circle.

### SL8-10: Sloping Tunnel and Cave-In

* The northern extension of the cave slopes steeply downward.
	* Originally connected to SL8-11, a cave-in has permanently blocked the passage.
	* Lying on the scree are the corpses of three Set guardsmen (2 ancient, 1 fresh).
		* The two ancient bodies have skulls that appear to have been bashed in from behind with a heavy object (see note at SL8-8).
			* Two suits of nonmagical Set armor, two short swords
		* The fresh body has been stung and clawed to death (by a Set animal).
			* A spear +1, three 50’ coils of rope, two neatly folded nets (15’x15’)
			* Tucked into a boot, a vial of Set animal repellent (av items).
				* The repellent is dried out, but could be rehydrated.

### SL8-11: Large Cave with Ancient Corpses

* This cave is cold and dry, with no sounds and not even a breath of air.
* Three ancient corpses lie among the knobby projections on the floor.
	* Two are of Set guardsmen, but the third is dressed in priest’s robes.
		* Two sets of Set armor (av items); two poisoned darts (25% still envenomed)
		* A ancient Set priest robes (75 gp), a platinum signet ring with the name “Hecurion” (500 gp), a scroll of protection from poison.
	* The priestly corpse is Hecurion, former director of the Set animal project (see SL8-16 to SL8-24).
		* Hecurion was garrotted, and his ring finger hacked off with a knife.  The murderer was Julianus, who slew the project staff on the orders of the last high priest of Set (see SL8-8).
		* Hecurion’s spirit lingers by his corpse, hoping that the Set ring, Lorica, which he once wore, can be recovered and returned to the proper Set authority.
			* The spirit mostly moans ‘Bring me Lorica’ (alternating Mithric and the  secret tongue of Set) and points at its missing finger.
			* If Lorica (SL8-8) is shown to the spirit, Hecurion whispers “For your reward, press the left eye of the middle statue of our lord. Thank you!” (advice for the puzzle at SL8-13).

### SL8-12: Cave with Portcullis

* Cold, still, and quiet like the rest of this area.
* This cave is empty save for a portcullis that blocks the tunnel to the west (to SL8-11).
	* Its mechanism, a lever and pulley system built into the north wall of this area, has been violently destroyed.  A lift gates roll would be needed to raise it.
* GM Note: the brood mother (SL8-13) could be lured here; she cannot be aided by the Eyes of Set in this location.

### SL8-13: Great Cave of the Set Animals

* This enormous cavern is 60’ tall in places.
	* Originally the site of the ancient Set cult’s research on Set animals, it is now deathly still, without any of the usual subterranean sounds or breezes.
	* Several rock formations stud the floor, rising between 5’ and 15’ above the ground.
	* An enormous 10' diameter rock pillar rises 30' to the cave ceiling in the cave's center.
		* Every square foot is covered with carved faces of Set in different sizes and artistic styles.
			* Some large (3’) and formal studies in Archontean realism, others small (6”) and primitive. Most are still painted.  The majority show a human face with red hair, but boars, crocodiles and other animals associated with the god are shown. The entire pillar radiates strongly of magic. 
			* The stone eyes of the images flutter open as soon as any living creature comes with 10’.
				* They are a conduit to a subconscious part of Set’s mind, and allow the god to witness and interact with events in this holy cavern.
				* His eyes cover the pillar, they can see anywhere in the cavern, and he guides the undead brood mother, granting:
					* An initial surprise round, always striking first during combat, the ability to teleport unerringly within the cavern.
					* Obscuration can block Set’s vision and negate these effects.
					* Dispel magic on the pillar also negates the effects for 1d3+3 rounds.
				* Set can open one of the rock mouths every other round, delivering a jolt of red energy to a target in the cavern.
					* Lawful Evil targets are healed (1d4)d8.
					* Evil or neutral individuals are Slowed.
					* Good creatures take (1d4)d8 damage.
					* The target of the blast will be the undead Set animal (50%) or a random member of the party (50%).
	* The northwest wall has also been flattened and carved with three colossal (20’), vivid and imposing half-round images of Set (with Set-animal head) carrying ankhs cradled in both arms.
		* A secret door (to SL8-13a) is set into the legs of the middle sculpture.
			* Difficult to spot (1 in 8).  Opens if the left eyeball of the central half-round carving of Set (17’ above the floor) be pushed inward.
			* The ghost of Hecurion (SL8-11) can assist in locating this trigger.
	* To the northeast the cave dips into a 20’-deep depression.
		* The floor of the depression is filled with hundreds of ancient and brittle bones, mostly of small to medium animals, but a few man-sized as well.
		* 4 Turns of searching: 231 ancient silver pennies, 79 ancient gold solidi, a chipped emerald (700 gp), scroll (fireball, freezing sphere, stone to flesh).

Brood Mother
* The cave is the lair of a huge undead Set animal, the brood mother, abandoned here over 1,200 years ago when the Archonteans retreated from Arden Vul (see SL8-8).
	* This fearsome creature is the undead revenant of the central breeding animal developed by the temple of Set in antiquity, and her evil nature and her strong association with Set allowed her to return to haunt this cavern.
* She manifests in the northeastern, bone-filled depression a turn after the cave is entered.
	* While in the cavern proper, the Eyes of Set on the central pillar aid her: healing and guiding (she gains surprise, acts first each round, and can teleport within the cave).
	* Should the pillar’s powers be masked, or should combat move to another location, she loses those abilities.

The brood mother, aka a giant undead Set animal: SZ L; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’; HD 8+8; HP 63; #AT 2; Dmg 1-10/1-4; MR 33%. Special attacks: energy drain; dispel magic 1/day; paralyzation.
* The brood mother’s abilities may be enhanced if the Eyes of Set are active (teleport, initial surprise, acts first in every round).

X / 63

3 hell hounds: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 5; HP 35, 31; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10. Special attacks: breathe fire; surprise on 1-4 in 6. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6. Special: 50% to spot hidden or invisible.

##### SL8-13a: Hidden Chamber

* This tiny chamber, only 4’ tall, holds a few choice treasures deposited here for security.
	* A 2’x3’ coffret made of solid silver, with enamelled plates affixed to its lid and sides; the enamel shows Set animals cavorting around an image of Set in his Set animal-headed bipedal form.
		* An exact copy of the Theskelonia (books; 10,000 gp or extensive favors from High Priestess Stephania in 4-51).
		* Six heavy platinum signet-style rings (500 gp each), whose faces have not yet been carved
		* An ankh of protection (new), a manual of golems, 4 pieces of incense of meditation, a candle of invocation.

### SL8-14: Side Cave 

* The mouth of this cave is 20’ above the floor of the neighboring cavern.
* A breath of air can be felt from the narrow crack (18” wide and 30” tall) in the northeast corner that leads to SL8-15.
* A 25’-long ladder and the corpse of an ancient Set priest lie against the western wall.
	* The priest’s robes have been rent by blades and he appears to have bled out.
		* Wears a heavy gold chain with gold holy symbol of Set (250 gp), scroll of protection from acid wrapped around his lower leg, under the robe.
		* Clenched in his teeth is a roll of parchment (secret tongue of the priests of Set, scrawled in blood; his own?): “Julianus has gone mad and is killing us all, even his own brothers. Someone must tell the high priest of this treachery. Perhaps the brood mother will save me, and punish him? Let it be so!”
			* GM: for Julianus, see SL8-8

### SL8-15: Tunnel and Cliff to SL9-1 (Kaliyani Pits)

* The lair of a pair of phase spiders that typically hunt lizardmen on Sub-Level 9, this tunnel is choked with spider webs.
	* Scraps of treasure and numerous bones litter the floor beneath the webs.
		* 3,097ancient gold solidi, a dagger +1, a scroll of protection from plants, a scroll of stone to flesh, and a star sapphire (3,000 gp).
	* The ‘tunnel’ to SL8-14 is only a crack, 18” wide and 30” tall.
		* The spiders are aware of it, but too large to squeeze down it.
			* ...they're phase spiders...
	* The ledge (aka SL9-1) is 20’ above the mushroom cave at SL9-2.

2 phase spiders: SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’, 150’ in web; HD 5+5; HP 43, 36; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: poison (-2 to saves). Special defenses: phasing. 

### SL8-16: Cliff and Entrance to Set Labs

* A worked ledge sits 40’ above the floor of the large cavern.
	* Two heavy iron screw-eyes are set into the stone at the edge of the cliff.  By each is an ancient and partly-rotted rope ladder (50% chance of breaking if used).
* A 5’-diameter circle in the floor is depicts a boar made of chips of red basalt surrounded by chips of blue granite.
	* Passing over causes a light spell to activate on the portcullis at SL8-17 and a magic mouth to intone (Mithric) “Passage is forbidden without permission of the director.”

### SL8-17: Portcullis and Levers

* Two heavy steel portcullises flank the entrance to area SL8-18.
	* Both are down, their bases fitted into 1’-deep holes in the floor.
	* The niche to the east of the portcullis contains two iron levers set into the floor.
		* The western lever raises and lowers the portcullis here (at SL8-17); the eastern lever raises the portcullis to the east of the door at SL8-18.

### SL8-18: Ancient Set Laboratory

* This chamber was a laboratory for experimentation on Set animal breeding.
	* A large purple pudding (new) lurks over the door, ready to drop on intruders.
* The room serves as a high-quality alchemical and research laboratory.
	* Benches, beakers, retorts, mortars and pestles, glass specimen bottles, bins with various alchemical supplies (10,000 gp if fully and carefully boxed and taken, 2000 gp if choice bits are taken).
		* Amid the mundane alchemical gear are a Set animal preserved in brine (55 gp), 16 vials of Set animal blood (100 gp per vial; magical qualities to be determined by the GM), a deacon’s was stick (new)
		* Inside a teak chest: 6 large codices entitled ‘Research into Our Lord’s Holy Form’ (secret tongue of Set)
			* They commence in 1511 AEP, with the final entry in 1803 AEP (the year of the abandonment of Arden Vul).
			* Cursory read: the Set cult commissioned a program to attempt to summon, tame, and breed Set animals (from context it appears that typically they can only be summoned, and by higher level clerics).
			* The three hundred-year project was mostly unsuccessful until the final decade, when Director Hecurion, summoned and bound a large Set animal, and then transformed it slightly with a complex infusion of human and dragon blood, along with arcanum and other alchemical elements.
			* The infusion preventing the Set animal from departing, and Hecurion set about attempting to turn it into a ‘brood mother’, capable of siring other similar ‘modified’ animals.
			* The last entry describes the brood mother’s growing size and some troubling aggressiveness, and laments that political conditions are preventing the project from securing the necessary resources to complete the breeding project.

1 large purple pudding (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 10; HP 66; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: corrosive to metal and leather. Special defenses: immune to fire; grows with electricity (heal 3d6, +1d6 tHP), vuln to cold (2x, slowed); conductive.

### SL8-19: Stairs Up to 4-162

* These narrow stairs, dusty and choked with cobwebs, lead up 200’ to area 4-162.
	* They have not been used in more than a thousand years.

### SL8-20: Ancient Set Barracks and Portcullis

* A dozen rotted wooden bunkbeds stand in the western half of this ancient barracks.
* To the east are eight battered wooden chairs, a few low tables, three weapons racks, six armor racks, and a trio of large wooden chests.
	* Among the detritus: 3 suits of red Set armor (av items); 6 short swords, 3 shields, 20 javelins, and a mummified heqeti head (25 gp).
	* Inside the chests: two silk handkerchiefs, a crude set of wooden dice, a finely carved set of obsidian chess pieces (50 gp), a sandalwood snuff box (20 gp), and three cones of incense of relaxation (new).
* On the north wall is a lever that controls the portcullis to the east of the door.
	* The portcullis is heavy steel and set into holes in the floor.
* The area is coated with a thick layer of dust.

### SL8-21: Common Area

* This chamber was a lounge for the members of the Set animal project.
	* It is stocked with a dozen comfortable leather chairs (now rotted), a liquor cabinet (four bottles of still-drinkable alcohol, 45 gp each), an inlaid gaming table (65 gp), a cabinet with desiccated meat and dried fruit, a keg of water, and a tripod of heating.

### SL8-22: Director’s Chamber

* This was the residence of the director of the Set animal project, the last being Hecurion (see SL8-11).
	* The north wall has a large fresco of red-haired Set standing benignly over a sextet of small Set animals.
	* A once-sumptuous bed (now rotted and dusty) lies to the west of the door.
	* To the east is a fine oaken circular table and three oak chairs, as well as an oak writing desk, an oak armoire, and an oak scroll cabinet (45 gp each).
		* Scroll case: three light romance ‘novelettes’, Hoel Gargus’s Sixteen Steps to Successful Administration, the anonymous Dogmatics of Father Set, Canis Renard’s Elements of Animal Reproduction, Kalut’s The Properties of Blood, especially when infused with other elements, and Licinius Monad’s Practical Animal Magic (books).
			* Tucked in is a cleric scroll (enthrall, cure critical wounds, true seeing).
		* Armoire: 3 ceremonial robes for Set priests.
		* Table: a silver ewer and six silver goblets (175 gp for the set), a bottle of ancient brandy (25 gp).
		* Desk: parchment, dried ink, pens, erasing stones, and other practical objects.
			* Hecurion’s diary (secret tongue of Set).
				* Most of the diary involves mundane comments about the difficulties of personnel management (Hecurion was insecure), speculation about the fate of the project given the collapsing social order in the city, and some extremely general but positive comments about Hecurion’s success with “the brood mother” and the likelihood of producing progeny.
				* The last entry is unusual, more specific and paranoid. “The most recent communication from Laurellik, our Father in Set, is disturbing. He seems preoccupied and unable to recognize the importance of our imminent success in the project. It is as if I have lost my favor with him. But how can this be? I have always served him faithfully. Undoubtedly our results will bring him around. I will send Julianus to beg his indulgence and to delay the evacuation for as long as possible, for the study is close to completion.”
					* (GM: for Julianus and Laurellik, see SL8-8)

### SL8-23: Priests’ Residence

* Six beds made of rotted pine, six chests, and six armoires comprise the contents of this former residence for the staff of the Set animal project.
	* Among the chests and armoires: usable cotton and silk clothing, a silver slide whistle (25 gp), three silver holy symbols of Set (35 gp each), a pack of battered playing cards, a set of finely-tooled metal dice (25 gp), a fine ivory comb (25 gp), copies of Meson’s Guide to the Brothels of Archontos and the Whispering Widow (books), 229 ancient copper bits, 94 ancient silver pennies, and 31 ancient gold solidi.
	* One chest has a false bottom.
		* Gold scapular clasp (100 gp), a pouch with six red garnets (100 gp each), a jade scroll case smeared with contact poison.
			* Within the case is a parchment commission in Mithric, from Laurellik the high priest of Set to the priest Julianus, ordering Julianus to report on the activities of Hercurion the Director and to await further orders from Laurellik himself (see SL8-8, SL8-11, SL8-22).
