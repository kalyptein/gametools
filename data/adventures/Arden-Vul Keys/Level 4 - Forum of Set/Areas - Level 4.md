 
### Overview

This level occupies an important place in the politics and social intercourse of the intelligent denizens of Arden Vul, an importance that perhaps exceeds the absolute power and number of its inhabitants. Nearly the entire level was originally the seat of the great Archontean temple devoted to Set, the cult of whom rank-ed only slightly behind that of Thoth in wealth and prestige. In antiquity a stair carved into the cliff face (EX-13) led up to a grand entrance, and then through a series of halls and stairways that rose inexorably to the Forum (4-2) and Temple (3-90) of Set.

At the present, the old halls are badly damaged and, despite the resurgence of a modern cult of Set in the old Forum area, the cult is greatly reduced and its power circumscribed. The level now features two or three main areas. The area south of the Red Bridge (4-120A) is still unclaimed by Set, although they have marked a path through the caves and ruined halls to the Forum; it is also the site the Hall of Worthies (4-164), a monument that is still remembered in Archontos. This region is full of monsters, ancient secrets, and danger.

The area north of the Red Bridge and south of the cavern at 4-66 serves as the home of the modern cult of Set; it includes the three mysteries of Set (4-23, 4-48, and 4-111), the Forum (4-2), and the Guild of Service (areas 4-6 to 4-20). Its two ancient necropolises are also found here (4-138 and 4-139), although they are currently occupied by powerful undead.

To the north of this region, past the cave at 4-66, are another set of mostly wild caverns and caves. 

The Forum (4-2) is well known to the intelligent factions of the Halls, and has come to rival the troll thegn’s court (7-75) as a place for the exchange of goods and information. Although not as widely known outside the Halls, the priests of Set retain important contacts in surrounding towns, and these contacts are able to encourage selected evil-aligned traders to visit the Forum of Set. Seasoned visitors to the Forum are quick to advise newcomers to tread carefully in Set’s halls, since the cult’s power is palpable and their motives inscrutable. Woe betide those who incur the displeasure of Stephania and her minions!

Significant Regions of Level 4

Precincts of Set
* (4-1 to 4-64, 4-101 to 4-106, 4-119 to 4-120, 4-122 to 4-136, 4-144, 4-149
* The modern Set cult controls most of the areas north of the Red Bridge (4-120A) and south of the Rushing River (see cavern 4-66). This area was carved in antiquity and only recently (about 90 years ago) reoccupied by a modern cult of Set. The area includes some important areas, including the Red Bridge (4-120A) over the chasm of Set (4-121) and the Forum of Set (4-2); other significant, but less well-known, areas include the First and Second Mysteries of Set (4-23 and 4-48), the Halls of the Guild of Service (4-4 to 4-20) and several sets of extremely long stairs, whose reputation as the avenues of evil is widespread in the Halls (i.e., 4-1, 4-19, 4-105). 
* Because the worship of Set has faded in the Archontean Empire (with Heschius Ban and Deballaton fulfilling his pantheonic functions), the cult is secretive and pursues its own agendas. That said, a small but steady trickle of commerce between the cult and the outside exists (via 4-190). The cult of Set is comprised of two distinct units, the priesthood, and the Guild of Service. While technically the priesthood, under High Priestess Stephania (4-51), rules the entire group, in practice the chief slaver, Gunnar, and the rest of the Guild operate quasi-independently. Stephania and her command staff, including the second priest (4-56), the third priest (4-57), the bibliothecarius (4-54), and the overseer (4-47), are responsible for operating the mysteries (although the third is shuttered at the moment), presiding over liturgical ceremonies in the Temple (3-90), ensuring the flow of trade to the Forum, and setting policy for the entire cult. Gunnar, the Chief Slaver (4-10), is advised by a trio of guildmasters (4-8A through 4-8C); they operate a regular slave market in the Forum and a powerful slaving ring that scours the halls for slaves. The slave market attracts buyers from within the halls, including the troll thegn (7-30) and the Lord of the Arena (6-85), and from without, including evil-aligned merchants and nobles from Newmarket and environs (e.g., Tikun Thane, at SL3-2). The cult is ruthless, but lawful; should visitors appear strong and demonstrate a clear reason for visiting the public areas of the cult (especially the Forum), those visitors will not be hindered, and may even be offered advice. Set guardsmen are thus only potentially dangerous in this region. The Guild of Service, however, considers any travelers on the Long Stair (4-19) to be fair game, that is, as likely sources of slaves; such travelers must appear exceptionally strong to avoid being assaulted, robbed, and sold as slaves in the Forum.
* Factions: This area is firmly controlled by the cult of Set. 
* Construction: Worked areas are Archontean, with 10’ ceilings and iron-bound doors. 
* Environment: The area is cool and dry

Northern Caves
* (4-66 to 4-100)
* In antiquity the areas north of the Rushing River were rather safe hunting grounds for the cult of Set. Today they are wild, and the Set guardsmen are largely afraid to venture to this region. Several types of monsters make this area their home, including a pack of fierce subterranean lizards, a small owlbear tribe, and others. Most notably a group of escaped slaves – fugitives from the Forum (4-2) – inhabit a cave above a small lake (4-100).
* Factions: No faction controls this area. The Set cult periodically sends patrols into these ‘wild caves’, but their efforts at exploration are as yet tepid. Likewise, the escaped slaves do some hunting in the area. Neither can be said to dominate the region.
* Construction: Most of the region is composed of natural caves
* Environment: The area is substantially more humid than the areas to the south

Behir Caves
* (4-107 to 4-118)
* Originally this area was a central part of the ancient cult of Set, as it contained the site at which the high priests performed the Third Mystery of their god (4-111). But in the absence of cultists, a behir took up residence here and the area is now part of its territory. Indeed, High Priestess Stephania’s immediate predecessor, Keladorus of Arcturos, was slain by the behir when he attempted to restore Set’s control of the region. Stephania has ordered the area to be boarded up until a solution can be arranged. 
* Factions: No faction controls this area, as the behir runs free here.
* Construction: Worked areas are Archontean, with 10’ ceilings and iron-bound doors. Due to the antiquity of the doors, there is a 33% chance for any door to be stuck.
* Environment: The area is substantially more humid than areas to the east, and is typically warmer.

Necropolis
* (4-137 to 4-143, 4-145 to 4-148)
* Built in antiquity by the then-politically powerful cult of Set, these areas are impressive examples of ancient masonry, art, and magic. Two enormous crypts (4-138 and 4-139) form the core of this area, with surrounding antechambers and a few hidden tombs. The main crypts held the corpses of those powerful and wealthy Archonteans who preferred to give themselves to Lord Set. During the long absence of the cult, however, the area came to be dominated by the greater mummy, Meskenit (4-139C). Meskenit’s control of the other undead in the area is so strong that, as with the area of the Third Mystery (4-111), the modern Set cult has had to delay efforts to reoccupy the necropolis. Those who defeated Meskenit would win much favor from High Priestess Stephania (4-51).
* Factions: No faction controls this area. It is the domain of Meskenit the greater mummy (see new monsters).
* Construction: The area is Archontean, with 10’ ceilings and solid stone doors. 
* Environment: The area is cold and dry.

Well-traveled Southern Tunnels
* (4-150 to 4-167, 4-170 to 4-190)
* The southern third of Level 4 has suffered badly over the centuries from minor earthquakes and cave-ins. The old worked areas, which included a large entry complex on the cliff side as well as some important administrative centers for the Archontean hegemons, either lie in ruins or are, in many cases, obliterated. A network of natural tunnels delved by monsters and expanded by the Set cult now wends its way through the ruins, sometimes taking advantage of vestiges of the old construction, and other times delving completely new tunnels. Some of the tunnels are relatively well-traveled by the Set cult and/or the lizardmen (who emerge from Sub-Level 5 to the exterior via 4-165). These tunnels, caves, and corridors are thus marginally safer than the surroundings, at least when it comes to wild monsters; the sentient travelers may well pose their own threats, of course. Other areas (4-150 to 4-158, 4-171, 4-173 to 4-177, 4-180 to 4-188) are less well-traveled; these are the truly lost or forgotten areas, unknown to the modern factions and ripe with secrets, treasures, and dangers. 
* Factions: No faction controls these areas.
* Construction: Worked areas are Archontean in origin, with 10’ ceilings and iron-bound doors. 
* Environment: The area is relatively dry and cool.

## Level 4: 1 - 15

### 4-1: Set’s Way, or the Sighing Stair

* Set’s Way, a 20’-wide set of ancient, pitted stairs is also known as the Sighing Stair.
	* It extends 100’ from 3-110 to the Forum of Set (4-2).
	* Those who stop to listen hear the very faint sound of sighing; if one listens for more than a round these sighs turn to groans, and then screams of anguish.
	* The stairs evoke a strong sensation of dread (-1 to d20 actions) for good-aligned creatures.

##### 4-1a: Busts

* These niches contain lifelike marble busts of the previous high priests of Set, carved to accentuate realism (wrinkles, warts) rather than artistic flattery.
* One of the busts (determine randomly) sits on top of an ancient treasure map.

##### 4-1b: Odd Busts

* These two trapezoidal niches contain a cluttered collection of unusual busts that contrast with the formalism of the niches located further up Set’s Way.
	* The busts are of stone and marble, but vary in size and race.
		* Small humanoids (goblins), vaguely reptilian heads, a strange horned head, a bat head, even the head of a frost giant.
		* The giant’s head is the only one not made of stone; it is an ever-alert head (new) nicknamed “Snowy” by the members of the cult of Set.
			* Snowy’s deep red eyes constantly scrutinize the stairs in front of it.
				* He (it?) can also see invisible objects and is, intriguingly, portable.
				* If it spots unauthorized passers-by (i.e., those not wearing a symbol of Set), it begins shouting loud vulgarisms in a variety of tongues, including Mithric, Archontean, Giantish, Goblin, and the Secret Language of Set, which is 33% likely to bring a patrol from 4-2. Snowy ceases shouting 1-3 rounds after intruders are out of view.

### 4-2: The Forum of Set

* The Forum is an iconic location in the Halls, known as a site for trade and negotiation.
	* A strong-looking party approaching from the south will be treated with respect and caution, and will easily be able to rest, trade, and barter within the Forum.
	* Those approaching from the east, down the Sighing Stairs (4-1) are assumed to be hostile unless accompanied by appropriate authorities. 
	* Those approaching from the northern caves (4-63 to 4-100) will be treated with intense suspicion and probably with hostility, although canny negotiation might convince the guards to escort them to the Forum proper.
	* Those intending violence find the Forum well-organized and are met with overwhelming force.

* The Forum is an imposing place, floored in smooth black marble.
	* Its walls are polished granite, rising 40’ to an impressive barrel vault.
	* Three 10’-diameter ovals, delicately painted as eyes, hang from the vaulting at equal intervals, radiating continual light.
	* The Forum is a noisy place, filled with the barks and groans of the slave market (4-3), the gurgle of the fountain (4-2E), the shrill cries of the peddlers hawking their wares (4-2D), the low murmur of conversation from the food stalls (4-2C), and the occasional deep bark of the guards watching from the Porch of Scrutiny (4-2F).
	* Odors also fill the forum, from the stink of sweat and fear rising from the slave market, to the spicy aroma of the food stalls, to the sometimes-exotic smells of the goods for sale. 

Laws of the Forum:
* The Lord of the Forum (aka Stephania, high priestess of Set; see 4-51) has promulgated the following rules which govern trade and social interaction in the Forum. The entire set of Laws is inscribed on the marble walls at 4-21.
	1. The Lord of the Forum is entitled to collect from any licensed trader a tariff worth 5% of the value of any sale made that trader.
	2. The Lord of the Forum is entitled to collect from any non-licensed trader a tariff worth 10% of the value of any sale made by any such trader. 
	3. Violence is not permitted in the Forum, except by permission of the Lord of the Forum.
	4. Spell Use is forbidden in the Forum except by license of the Lord of the Forum.
	5. The Lord of the Forum guarantees the security of all persons and goods legally present in the Forum. Theft shall be punished by fines or enslavement.
	6. The Lord of the Forum guarantees any contract made in the Forum, although the Lord does not guarantee the quality or veracity of any traded goods. Caveat emptor!
	7. All weights and measures shall be enforced and guaranteed by the Lord of the Forum.
	8. Those defaulting on a sworn contract shall face appropriate punishment: outlawry or enslavement.
	9. The Lord of the Forum offers protection to any licensed trader to and from the Forum.
	10. Any accusation of misconduct, including the breaking of any of the Laws of the Forum, should immediately be brought to the attention of a Forum Inspector (see below) so that an appropriate hearing may be scheduled.

Inhabitants
* Serving as the chief center of trade for denizens of the upper Halls and an important (and arguably safer) alternative to the Troll Market (7-76), the Forum of Set is filled with activity.
* Many inhabitants are properly described in the relevant sub-sections of the forum, but some regular and occasional inhabitants of the Forum are described here:

##### A. Regular Inhabitants (present at all times):

* Elite Guardsmen and the Duty Deacon
	* Two sections (3 elite guardsmen and a sergeant each) of elite guardsmen are present at all times in the Forum.
	* One section stands by the northern exit to Set’s Way (4-1), ensuring only approved persons enter the private areas.
		* An advanced acolyte leads this group.
	* The second section moves slowly through the Forum in a regular pattern.
		* Attached to this section is the Duty Deacon, a Set deacon deputed by High Priestess Stephania (4-51) to act as the reigning authority over the forum.
		* The Duty Deacon and guards will be summoned e.g. if visitors refuse to pay their dues to the Forum Inspectors (see below).
		* The Duty Deacon holds a key to one of the 3 locks to the Vaults of Set (4-24).

* The Conquered Foes
	* Three pitiful slaves are shackled to the feet of the great cult statue of Set (4-2A).
		* Each is naked save for an elaborate leather-and-metal helmet made to look like one of Set’s traditional enemies: the hawk for Horus, the ibis for Thoth, and the tyet (knot of Isis) for Isis.
		* They are kept drugged by the wisps of narcotic from 4-2a.
			* They commonly writhe about and sometimes call out wordless pleas for help.  Cultists passing through the forum kick them regularly.
		* When one slave dies, another is quickly selected to take up the role.

* Forum Inspectors
	* 3 senior cultists wander slowly through the Forum enforcing the Laws of the Forum.
		* They have the power to question any non-Set person/creature whom they suspect of having engaged in commerce without paying the proper tax. 
		* Habitués of the Forum know to seek them out immediately after a purchase or sale to pay the requisite fee.  Set does not smile on efforts to avoid his due.

* Cultists
	* There are always be 3d8 Set cultists present in the Forum in 1-4 distinct groups.
	* They mill about, admiring sites, bartering for trinkets, waiting to access the mysteries (4-23 and 4-48), and hoping to pilgrimage to the main temple (3-90).
	* Each group should make two rolls: a standard reaction roll, and a roll on Table 3 below (ulterior motivations). 

3-24 Set cultists (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 9; MV 90’; HD 1; HP 7(x3), 6(x4), 5(x5), 4(x7), 3(x5); #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (dagger) or 2-7 (flail) or 1-6 (staff). Special attacks: fanaticism.

* A band of 5 female human mercenaries from Narsileon loudly looking for a solid job and good plunder.
* They have been hired by the Collegium of Cinder to locate the archmage Kerbog Khan (SL12-25) and negotiate with him concerning the properties and value of a mysterious bone wand carried by Leila herself.

Leila, 6th-level female Thorcin fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 59; #AT 1; Dmg 4-11 (battle axe +2). Abilities: STR 17; INT 13; WIS 10; DEX 10; CON 16; CHA 14. Possessions:

B. Gislu the Goblin Mystic and his 12 Followers 
* Gislu is an exile from the Goblin Warrens (SL4) and is offering the services of his band as guides and mercenaries, and claiming to know the layout of Levels 3 and 5 quite well.
* Gislu would like to locate the tomb of Ythak Furl (3-168), which he ‘knows’ is on Level 3.
	* He is reticent to explain his interest in this tomb beyond ‘it's filled with riches’; if pressed, Gislu admits that the fabled scepter of the goblins (new) lies within.
	* As no modern goblin, let alone Gislu himself, knows what the scepter looks like, he will have trouble identifying the scepter should the tomb be located and plundered.
	* Eventually, Gislu will wrongly identify the troll flute (see new magic items) found in the tomb as the missing scepter. Gislu will demand the ‘scepter’ as his share, and he and his followers will fight for this object if necessary.
	* Location of the scepter, whether the real scepter (currently in 8-69) or the misidentified one (3-168) leads to a major political struggle within the goblin court on SL4 (see SL4-23 and SL4-22).
	* Gislu’s strong beliefs have been abetted by Sir Discord (8-116), who has his own reasons for locating the scepter.

	* He is actually an agent of a good-aligned deity or organization and here to spy on the defenses, rituals, and powers of the cult of Set. 
	* A ranger with a taste for music and disguise, Meral might decide to enlist the PCs for his cause if he can be persuaded of their good intentions.

	* Puffs of odorless, near-invisible blue gas, the Breath of Set, are released at regular intervals from the statue's mouth.
		* Wafting lazily to the ground, the gas's narcotic effect induces mild hallucinations in anyone who breathes it for more than a few rounds.
			* Victims stand immobile as they contemplate their own godhood.  Save vs poison each Turn to shake it off (cumulative -1 each Turn if still standing in the vapor).  Afterward, -2 to roll for 2d6 Turns from grogginess.
			* Chance to detect as a secret door, if unwary.
		* It is widely understood that those rendered afflicted by the gas are not subject to the normal Laws of the Forum: they may be robbed or captured as slaves.
* "The Conquered Foes" are three pathetic, naked slaves are kept chained to the feet of the statue at all times.
	* They are forced to wear elaborate leather-and-metal masks depicting Set’s chief enemies, Thoth (ibis), Isis (queen, tyet), and Horus (hawk).
	* The Breath of Set keeps them stupefied, though they commonly writhe about and sometimes call out wordless pleas for help.
	* They are commonly mocked and occasionally kicked by those with too much time on their hands or by those wishing to impress the priests of Set.
	* When one slave dies, another is quickly selected to take up the role.

##### 4-2e: Smithy

	* Two smiths and four assistants hurry about a central fire and two anvils, forging simple weapons, suits of Set armor (av items), and common iron implements.

	* The smiths are capable, but cannot create enchanted equipment.

### 4-3: Slave Market

* The Guild of Service is a major force in the cult of Set, controlling the lucrative slave trade.
	* It is in many practical ways autonomous from the priestly hierarchy, administering its sector to the east of the Forum (4-3 to 4-14) as a quasi-private fiefdom.

* To protect the manumitted, owners may purchase writs of manumission (5 gp each) from the Forum Inspectors.
* Freed slaves may have difficulty safely exiting the Halls without a suitable escort.
* Manumission writs are only useful in the environs of the Forum; the Guild frequently re-enslaves those it can catch after their documents are ‘lost’.

### 4-11: Slave Pit: The Workers

* The first of the three official slave pits operated by the Guild of Service, containing those judged by the guild to be simple laborers.
* The pit is accessed through the locked iron door at the end of the diagonal passageway.
	* A slit in the door, openable only from the south side, allows inspection of the pit before the door is opened.
* A 10’x10’ stone ledge extends into the pit itself.
	* On the ledge are two torch holders, a portable gong, and a winch and bucket, used for lowering food and raising slaves for the auction.
	* Two guildsmen armed with halberds stand on the ledge at all times.
* The walls of the chamber slope inward on all sides, descending 25’ down to the rectangular floor (25’ x 35’ ).
	* The walls are slick with moisture and hard to climb.
	* On the floor is a 10’x10’x10’ stone cistern (directly in front of the ledge).
		* Normally 3/4 full of stagnant but potable water. Once a week the guards slosh new water into the cistern from the ledge.
	* A small, 2’-diameter latrine hole extends 10’ below the floor on its northern edge.
		* It reeks with an overpowering, nauseating stench.
* The pit is otherwise bare of furnishings, and the low-value laboring slaves are allowed to fend for themselves in a survival-of-the-fittest setting.
* Due to the terrible suffering here and the relative lack of attention paid to the inhabitants of the pit, the entire place reeks of sweat, fear, feces, and death.

* There are always 15-40 wretched specimens in various stages of decrepitude in the pit.
	* 25% will be sold off in a given week, replaced by 75%-150% of new slaves.
	* The Guild simply announces a number, and those in the pit struggle to gain a seat in the basket.
		* This selection process means 50% of those in the Pit are perpetually weak and malnourished, unlikely to ever be sold.  It is the strong, recent arrivals who tend to make it to the block in the Forum.
	* On the last day of the month four of the weakest slaves are culled from the pit and taken to the Shrine of Set-Sobek (3-91) where their limbs are placed in the mouth of the statue.  The aquamarines gained added to the Vaults of Set (4-24).
	* New arrivals dream of escape, and there are some bone clubs and shivs hidden among the shuffling bodies.

	* Due to the better conditions and food, this Pit smells less foul and presents less of a hopeless outlook than does 4-11.

* The Guild selects those with mining, stone working, and crafting skills for this pit.
	* Usually 13-26 skilled slaves awaiting sale in the Forum; 80% human and 20% other intelligent race (predominantly goblin).

	* A rack of unpleasant instruments hangs on the northeast wall (250 gp to evil organizations).

* 50% chance that torture session is under way.
	* If so, the Chief Torturer, Ukamah Gol, is leading it, along with his two assistants.  Otherwise, the two assistants are present, lounging or sleeping.
* If confronted by obvious hostility, Ukamah Gol rushes to the doorway to 4-14a and shouts “Klimopercet! I require you!”, causing the demon Klimopercet manifests and joins the fray (see 4-14a).
	* The assistants do not know about the demon, but still do not enter 4-14a for any reason.

Ukamah Gol (50%), 7th-level male Khumus illusionist: SZ M; AL CE; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (dagger). Abilities: STR 9, INT 16, WIS 11, DEX 16, CON 11, CHA 7.

##### 4-14a: Torturer’s Chamber

* Ukamah Gol, the Chief Torturer of the Guild of Service, makes his home in this narrow chamber.
	* Ukamah’s bed, a stool, a chest of clothing, an odd manikin, and countless handmade wooden, bone, and leather shelves of small size.
		* The area around the bed stinks of decay and blood, the floor under the bed is stained with copious amounts of spilled blood.
		* The mundane effects and clothing are ratty and unimpressive.
	* The shelves are packed with candles of all shapes and sizes; their flickering light lends the room a creepy aura. 
		* The candles (vaguely magical) are part of a charm to give protection to the torturer while he sleeps.
	* East wall (above the bed): covered with scrawling of various sizes and scripts, and in a variety of languages and inks.
		* If deciphered, each bit of writing in all languages says the same: “Klimopercet Requires Blood.”  The reader must save vs spells or be stunned 1d2 rounds from the blasphemous nature of the writing and its implications.
	* West wall (above door): Ukamah Gol has a surprising amount of wealth concealed in an invisible chest on an invisible shelf above the western door. 
		* 10 platinum bars (10 lb, 2,500 gp each), 4 lb of valuable spices (200 gp/lb), 4 golden teeth (10 gp each), potions (extra healing, growth), a scroll  (phantasmal force, deafness, rope trick, massmorph, tempus fugit), Ukamah Gol’s spell book. 

* Ukamah Gol is bound to a particularly nasty demon in a weird sort of reciprocal way.
	* The demon, Klimopercet, is bound to this chamber and requires near daily quantities of fresh blood to keep it from devouring Ukamah Gol.
	* The two have come to an uneasy agreement, with Ukamah Gol providing Klimopercet with blood, and Klimopercet providing Ukamah Gol with enhanced senses and attributes (and agreeing not to devour him).
	* The strain of this relationship has begun to tell on the torturer, who has begun to practice his trade regardless of its necessity.

* If anyone other than Ukamah Gol enters the chamber, the candles will gutter and flicker, and will start to extinguish themselves.
	* This takes 3d4 rounds. Once the last candle is extinguished, Klimopercet manifests, hungry for blood.  Relighting candles delays this, but they will keep going out.
	* Formally calling on Klimopercet to abjure this chamber banishes it for 1d3 days, but a sloppy adbjuration immediately extinguishes the candles and causes it to appear.
* If a hostile party encounters Ukamah Gol here, he swiftly invokes his demonic ally.

* Klimopercet can be distracted by significant (2 pints, or 5 hp) amounts of fresh blood.
	* Klimopercet understands Archontean, but can only communicate on this plane through a series of long keening tones that rise or fall after 5 seconds of stability (e.g., “Eeeeeeee-ah”).
	* Ukamah Gol doesn’t really understand this language, but knows how to placate the demon anyway.

Ukamah Gol (50%): for stats, see area 4-14.

Klimopercet, a blood-seeking demon (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 0; MV 60’; HD 9; HP 61; #AT 3; Dmg 2-8/2-8/2-8; MR: 25%. Special attacks: drain blood; stun; darkness 2/
day. Special defenses: standard demonic defenses; toxic slime.
* Although Klimopercet could normally use gate to bring allies, the terms of his binding prevent him from using that so long as he is in 4-14 or 4-14a. 

Ukamah Gol’s Spell Book: Audible glamer, change self, chromatic orb, color spray, darkness, detect invisibility, light, phantasmal force, phantom armor, wall of fog; blur, brain full of small spiders (see new spells), deafness, detect magic, improved phantasmal force, invisibility, mirror image, misdirection; continual light, dispel illusion, fear, paralyzation; confusion, massmorph; shadow door.

	* The floor of the room slopes gently to a drain set in its center.
	* Wall-mounted basins are on the north and south walls; the fountainhead of each of basin is a rearing cobra, to which is attached a flexible, hide tube that can be used to drench the filthy slaves taken from the pits. 
* 25% chance a group of 8 slaves are being prepared here.  The preparation will involve four administrators from the guild and will be overseen by four bored (but well-armed) guildsmen.

8 slaves (25% chance): if indicated, roll d6: 1-3: unskilled slaves; 4-5: skilled; 6: valuable. Consult areas 4-11, 4-12, or 4-13 for the appropriate stats.

	* The north wall features several impressive, brightly-painted stone carvings.
		* 2 40' colossi of Set-animal-headed humans, carved in half-round, turned to the center of the wall, wielding whips.
			* Their eyes glitter in light, being pieces of amber (500 gp each).  Prying them out incurs a dreadful curse from Set himself (GM’s choice).
		* Between the figures, a smaller (20’-tall) naked human crouches, arms over his head for protection from the whips.
	* The plaza is lit with torches, and shares some of the light from the Forum.

* At all times the plaza is guarded by four well-armed guildsmen.
	* One holds the key to the locked door in 4-150.

### 4-18: Pit of the Damned

* This is the infamous fourth slave pit operated by the Guild of Service.
	* Here the Guild tosses those too weak to sell and/or proven too troublesome.
* The locked iron door leads to a twisting stone staircase that descends 40’ before opening into a dark landing.
	* Rising from the pit 40’ below is a foul reek of excrement and decay.
	* The pit contains 5-30 emaciated, starving, and cannibalistic wretches.
		* Most came from the Pit of the Laborers, but about 25% are adventurers (in a relatively healthy state).
	* An ancient stone cistern in the southwest corner contains a few inches of rancid water; the strongest inhabitants defend this resource ferociously.
		* Moisture from the walls will add 1” of liquid every week.
	* The floor of the pit is covered with a 3’-deep layer of bones, picked clean by the starving inmates, and a scattering of 23 sp and a large and beautiful beryl (500 gp).

5-30 poor souls of all races and types.

### 4-19: The Long Stair

* The Long Stair is well known in the Halls as a symbol of slavery and misery.
	* The stairs, carved from the bare rock, traverse 400’ in length and altitude, providing direct access to the precincts of the Guild of Service.
		* They are pitted and worn by the tread of countless feet. 
		* Every 30’ along the stairs is a carven face (twice human size, with realistic eyes, nose, and mouth) twisted into a rictus of agony or desperation, each unique.
			* The sound of desperate wailing and ululation can be heard by listening closely to the mouth of any face.
			* In one of the nostrils (cumulative 10% per face inspected) is a folded-up piece of parchment.
				* Instructions to a ‘great treasure’ within the halls (GM’s choice, but perhaps directions from the tomb of Marius (6-154) to the tomb of Lucius Cornelius scriptor (6-130 to 6-135)).
				* Also on the parchment are some cryptic notes: “Ekezalion,” “R3L2R7L2” and “Fear=Death.”
					* GM: gibberish, unless the GM wishes to assign meaning.
	* Secret Door (west, to 4-101a): opens by pushing a stone panel inwards.

### 4-20: Guild Members’ Recreation

* A chamber for the recreational perversions of the members of the Guild of Service.
	* The walls are cheaply whitewash with layers of graffiti, mostly pornographic and repulsive.
	* East wall: a wooden bar, where No-Thumbs serves tankards of Jobim’s lichen ale (1 sp/pint), and a huge hearth, lit by continual light (fuel is hard to come by).
	* Center: 10 round wooden tables with benches and chairs fill most of the center.
	* South wall: cloaked by a set of curtains, divided into 8’x8’ romance cubicles.
		* Unfortunate slaves provide ‘hospitality’ to guild members in these squalid and relatively public cubicles.
	* A number of off-duty guildsmen are always present, dicing, drinking, gambling, and generally relaxing.

1-3 male and 5-7 female Thorcin hospitality slaves: use stats for skilled slaves (see area 4-12). These slaves are handsome/pretty, and should be considered to have CHA 14-17.

### 4-21: Inspection Point

* A heavily armed squad of Set guardsmen stands guard just north of the Darkness of Set (4-22), ready to inspect all seeking entrance to the Forum.
	* If the magic mouth at 4-22 is triggered, they are ready with spears and nets to greet all comers.
	* Those displaying a personalized travel pass or known personally to the sergeant can proceed immediately.  All others must submit to inspection and a 10 gp / person toll.
		* All persons must state their names, professions, and reasons for seeking entrance to the Forum.
		* Evasiveness or arrogance causes Sgt. Arethas to empty every pack and sack, while taking note of everything of value.
		* Those who are confident but humble can get away with a quick iteration of their personal possessions and of any trade goods they are carrying.
* The patrol members are dressed in red Set armor (av items) and each wears a set of magical eyes of Set (new).
	* Huge goggles with strange, greenish, crystalline lenses; somewhat intimidating (allows darkvision w/in darkness created by setite magic).

### 4-22: The Darkness of Set

* At the top of the Stair of Commerce (4-105) is an area of magical darkness (12th level to dispel), known as the Darkness of Set.
	* It covers the entire 20’x20’ area of the turn in the stairway, and can be seen from 75’ away due to the brightness of the rest of the stairs.
	* Hidden within the darkness is a cult statue of Set; most pass without ever knowing of its existence.
		* A magic mouth on the statue speaks (Mithric) when approaches within 10’ of the Darkness, “Set accepts the reverence of the humble. Approach as a supplicant, and be spared! Approach with hostility and be scourged!”
			* This almost always alerts the guards at 4-21.
		* An 8’-tall cult statue of Set in Set animal form.
			* If view, it is richly gilded and painted in classic pose, with citrine eyes (300 gp each), onyx ears (75 gp each), and ivory teeth (20x 25 gp each).
			* Attempts to despoil it cause a magic mouth (Archontean) “To me! Vandals! Thieves! To me!” and electric shocks (1d4 / round, 1 round to pry out one valuable item).
				* These cries draw immediate support from the guards at 4-21, whose  eyes of Set (new) can see in the darkness. 
* A 5’-square brass plaque is inset on the east wall just before the area of darkness.
	* Contains formal text (Mithric).  Preamble: "Visitors to the Forum shall advance five paces, turn to the right, and advance another five paces before submitting to inspection. Hostile actions will be met with a swift and severe response. Death, loss, or servitude is the just fate of all who trifle with Lord Set or neglect to adhere to his most reasonable laws."  A list of The Laws of the Forum (see 4-2) follows.

### 4-23: 1st Mystery of Set: the Black Boar

* This hall houses the first of the three Mysteries of Set, that of the Black Boar.
	* The hall is 25’ tall and sheathed in panels of black marble.
	* Two 10’x10’ niches in the western wall are pens fenced with iron bars.
		* Each holds an enormous wild boar who slavers, grunts, and foams the entire time visitors are present.
		* If visitors prove hostile or unduly disrespectful, a Set acolyte will emerge from the Boar and release the boars, who will attack anyone and everyone in sight or scent range.
		* Amid the dirty straw of one pen is a torn fragment of a treasure map.
	* At the east end, 15' up on either side of the entrance, is a semi-circular balcony.
		* Narrow tunnels lead from the balconies to 4-2F.
		* On each ledge, 2 Set guardsmen with crossbows, wearing eyes of Set (new), stand during the mystery ceremony.  If combat breaks out, one of the four will rush to alert the Forum while the other three fire bolts.
	* The Boar sits on an 8’-tall rectangular slab of granite.
		* It is 8’ long, 5’ wide, and 8’ tall; cleverly constructed of wood, wire, and plaster, with large ivory tusks (245 gp each).  It is painted a matte black, with numerous bits of colored glass and fragments of bone embedded in its surface.
		* The boar is partly magical and partly mechanical.  It uses magic mouths to speak the ritual.  Two Set acolytes are responsible for operating the boar from a cramped chamber within during performance of the mystery.  They pull levers, activate smoke and magical effects, creating a dramatic, if slightly cheesy, display.
	* Secret Door (west): difficult to detect (1 in 8) and unknown to the cult of Set.
		* It opens by rapping 5 times in rapid succession on the door itself.

The First Mystery
* The first mystery is open to all, and newcomers to the Forum will frequently be urged to visit it.  This chamber is one of the most commonly visited within the precincts of Set.
	* The mystery occurs every hour on the hour. Visitors begin gathering 15 minutes early under the overhang of the Porch of Scrutiny (4-2F).  2 lazy guardsmen with polearms stand in front of the door to 4-23, preventing entry until appropriate.
* This mystery recreates one of the legendary stories of Set.
	* When the other gods began to cavil at his forceful deeds and to levy restrictions on his actions, Set sought a way to operate outside of their prying gaze.
	* Changing into one of his favorite forms, a colossal black boar, Set leaped forth and swallowed the sun, thus preventing the others from seeing his form or his deeds and, incidentally, plunging the world into chaos.
	* Only after the other gods agreed to cease interfering with his affairs did the Set boar belch forth the sun. 
* The Mystery of the Black Boar
	* At the stroke of the hour, the guardsmen open the door to 4-23 and visitors crowd into the chamber. The guards then shut the doors, and the celebrants are left in darkness, save for a dull globe of yellow light bobbings above their heads.
	* At five minutes past the hour a disembodied voice, nasal and reedy, proclaims slowly in Archontean, “The Sun God lorded over the lands, confident in his power and his distance from earth.”  The globe of light glows oppressively bright.
	* Three minutes later, a deep, charismatic new voice proclaims “But Lord Set disdains arrogance without strength. And so he assumed his favored form and Lo! (a rumble of drums and a crash of cymbals), Lord Set devoured the Sun God!”  Bright light fills the rest of the chamber, revealing the boar.
		* First-time visitors usually gasp to see a huge black boar standing on an 8’-tall platform in front of them.
	* The boar lunges forward and upward and devours the orb of light, plunging the room back into darkness, filled with terrible sounds of rending, groaning and grinding.  A faint outline of the boar, illuminated in red light can be seen, towering over the celebrants.
	* The stentorian voice ends the ritual in these words “The arrogant and foolish Sun God was held in darkness, until the gods submitted.  Thus Lord Set's might triumphs over all!”  The celebrants kneel before the boar.
		* Celebrants who kneel receive a blessing for 1 week: +1 morale, +1 loyalty to their master, and -2 to saves against spells from Set's priests.
	* The doors open, and visitors are ushered back into the Forum, usually to mill about for a bit.

### 4-35: Currently Uninhabited Chamber

Same basic furnishings as 4-28.

### 4-36: Forgotten Spy Tunnels

* These narrow corridors allowed ancient spymasters of Set to spy on the trader’s square.
	* Unused for centuries, the tunnels are cold, dark, and extremely dusty (2”-thick layer).
	* Spy-holes provide clear viewing of activities in 4-25, 4-26 and 4-27.
	* Access to the tunnels and the spymasters’ lair (4-37 to 4-39) is via secret doors to 4-23 and to the corridor connecting 4-61 to 4-48.

### 4-37: Forgotten Chamber

* This former planning chamber was the seat of the original Set cult’s considerable spy networks during the glory days of Arden Vul.
	* Two wooden frames occupy the western wall; each with parchment maps pinned up.
	* A 10' square wooden table occupies the center, around which are several benches.
		* Several candelabra rest on the table, along with 1d8 more maps, plus 1d4 writs and a few blank sheets of parchment.
			* The maps are of great potential value.
				* The GM should decide in advance which areas they represent.  Each contains good information on ~20 rooms from Levels 1-5.  Certain areas should be off limits (e.g., the midnight road), but the rest should be fair game as a reward to a party locates this hoard.
	* A cabinet against the south wall has four shelves filled with a variety of useful things for a spymaster
		* Small boxes containing wooden counters of different colors and shapes; a supply of parchment, quills, and ink (dry); 100 carnelians of low quality (10 gp each); several sticks of sealing wax plus some fragments of sticks; a variety of stolen signet rings (worth 10d10 gp each), etc.
	* The east wall has a row of wooden pegs, one holding a battered cloak. 

### 4-38: Long Dead Spymaster

* Here lived the spymaster for the old cult of Set.
	* When the end of the city was nigh, the last master, Constantius Silvius, chose to seal his secrets away and commit suicide rather than allow generations of intelligence to be pillaged by forces unknown.
* Constantius’s chambers are relatively spartan.
	* A large and somewhat unsettling portrait of the spy-lord stares from the south wall.
		* This portrait depicts a gaunt man in white-face with red cheek-spots, a pronounced Roman nose, several warts on his forehead, and piercing eyes suggestive of cold intelligence.
	* A now-crumbling four-poster bed, an easy chair, a writing desk, a scroll case, a water barrel (now dry), a chest, and a small table with a platinum dining service. 
		* Platinum dining service (3 goblets, ewer, plate, silverware, serving bowl, 800 gp)
			* The goblet in Constantius’s hands is still coated with poison.
		* Scroll case: 3-12 scrolls with incriminating (but out-of-date) information about imperial officials and families.
			* Historical value to an imperial collector, and could plant a seed for a quest involving current political factions.
		* Chest: faded but usable Set ceremonial robes (100 gp to current Setites).
* Sitting in the chair of the writing desk is a desiccated corpse that still grips one of the platinum goblets.
	* This is Constantius, who drank hemlock and died as the city fell into chaos. 
	* His last testament lies before him.
		* It is strangely personal and emotional, with numerous underlined words and strangely capitalized letters (as if it were a 19th-century romantic novel).
		* The writing is breathless, a lament over the decline and fall of Arden Vul, the futility of his life, and his regrets at tasks left unaccomplished.
		* It contains nothing useful because it is, in fact, a simple code: the underlining indicates a space in the message (i.e., it should not be read), while the capitalized letters, if removed and unscrambled, reveal a message.
			* 4d8 under INT to detect the secret (secret tongue of the priests of Set): “To my successor: Seek the documents in the room opposite. They are revealed by invoking the Black Boar. Speak Thrice Five.“

### 4-39: Lesser Conference Room

* This chamber is similarly furnished to 4-37, save the absence of maps and documents.
	* An invisible chest is hidden under the middle of the conference table.
		* Speaking (Mithric) "black boar" reveals the chest beneath the table (one must still look beneath the table to see it).
		* The grey plasteel chest, a rudishva relic, has a clear panel on its front.
			* It opens by speaking the number 5 three times in a row (‘thrice five’) in Mithric or Rudishva.
			* 12x 10-lb bars of pure platinum (2,500 gp each) and extremely sensitive documents involving the imperial family.
				* Although over one thousand years old, they still possess volatile political value (at the GM’s wish: they might reveal that the imperial family is descended from bastards, or that they worship demons, or something like that).
	* The corpses of two murdered servants of Constantius are slumped in the room.
		* One has risen as a wraith.
	* Secret Door (west): opens by pushing the corner of one of the map frames.
		* It leads to a tiny chamber with a series of rough-carved, cutback stairs descending 60’ to a short tunnel to the Shrine of the Snake (4-51a).
		* The secret door is of recent construction (see 4-51a, made by the Kaliyani).

1 wraith: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 120’, 240’ flying (Class B); HD 5+3; HP 37; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

		* The triangular war-pennon of the sept hangs on the western wall.
		* The sept’s war chest is under the table.
			* 2,931 sp and 12,641 cp for use in emergencies by members of the sept.
	* The sept keeps a large billy goat named Sparky as a mascot.
		* Sparky has the run of the barracks, and is quite aggressive. The lowest ranking member of the sept has the unenviable task of cleaning up after Sparky.

	* At precisely noon, Stephania (or another upper-circle priest) appears on the western platform accompanied by a drugged slave (or naughty acolyte).
	* She shouts the ritual words in the secret tongue of the priests of Set: 
		* “Set is spawned from the desert sands, hardy and severe. Let our hearts seek the discipline of the desert as we achieve his ends!” Applause is expected.
		* “When angered, Set looses his fury like the desert storm! Let those who cannot endure, perish!”
		* She kicks the victim onto the sands below, and, as the giant scorpions emerge to feast, she uses her rod of wind control (new) to produce a small but impressive sandstorm.  The entire chamber (save Stephania’s platform) is racked with howling wind and blowing sand for 2 full minutes.
			* During this performance, it is not uncommon for Set cultists on the main platform to settle old scores by pushing rivals into the maelstrom.
		* After two minutes, Stephania shouts in Archontean, in an enhanced voice that echoes through the winds, “For those who pursue his will, Lord Set eases their way, just as he tames the desert storms!  Speak your pleas!”
			* Those who ask a question into the winds may receive the a divination whispered in their ear, if their intent pleases Set.  Those who's aims  displease him receive a chilling warning or threat.
			* Celebrants often compete to purchase the victim to be sacrificed, as this gesture improves their odds of receiving guidance.
		* The winds cease and the chamber returns to normal. Celebrants are likely to witness the giant scorpions finishing off the sacrifice and anyone else who has fallen to the sands.

GM Note
* Stephania was shocked fifteen years ago when a kaliyani digging party broke through the wall of 4-51.  Linking the snake-like kaliyani to one of Set’s favorite incarnations (the snake) was an easy way to establish an alliance, and the kaliyani were quick to recognize the potential value of such an alliance.
	* Over the past decade, the stairs linking 4-51 and 4-51a have been completed, and the shrine in 4-51a constructed.
	* The kaliyani have not told Stephania that they also completed a second set of stairs, with secret door, leading to area 4-39.
* As yet, no priest or priestess has visited the kaliyani compound, but the high priestess does take regular consultation with her allies about affairs on the lower levels.
	* Knowledge of this strange alliance is limited to High Priestess Stephania, Alexandros the Bibliothecarius (4-54), and Belisarius the Overseer (4-47).
	* Marius Junienos, Lacedaion of Archontos, and the Guildmasters of Service are merely aware that the high priestess has a private shrine.

	* 25% chance he has brought an interesting volume from the library (4-55) to study.

	* Most of the volumes are recent, the sort of thing that one can still buy at higher-end booksellers in any of the large cities of the Empire: memoirs of imperial officials; official histories of the empire; general treatises on magic, theology, estate management, or monster ecology; medical treatises; recipes for potions and poisons; and so forth.

			* Along the walls are shelves holding 11 marble busts (100 gp each, heavy), mostly of members of Marius’s family, but also of former priests of Set.

			* The coffee table has a solid gold coffee service (300 gp).
			* The weapons and armor are unused and for display only.
				* Set armor +2 (av items), a ceremonial spear of ebony (100 gp), a short sword +1

Marius Junienos
* Second-in-command of the cult of Set, and a member of the Junienos clan, of the Five Families, thus an aristocrat of the highest rank.
	* His kinsmen have claimed Marius died in a fire, although a few (and the Imperial Drome) know the truth: that Marius is thoroughly evil and that he cares more for the restoration of the cult of Set than for kin or empire.
	* Though unscrupulous, Marius is completely loyal to Stephania, whose abilities and iron will he admires. 
* Marius is a thin, ascetic-looking man of middle age, with a long nose and receding hairline.
	* He wears a red robe blazoned with a black boar, red bracers of defense (AC 3), and a red cloth headdress shaped like a Set animal.
	* His bearing is aristocratic, with little patience with the slow or insipid.
	* Marius’s great skill lies in subtle political machinations, and he has numerous schemes in various stages of completion, both within the Halls and without.
		* He's the lead on dealing with Iskander?
	* Marius’s private wealth has helped prop up the cult, and Stephania values him enormously.
	* Marius loathes Anna Ligareon (4-8) and shows it by ignoring her completely.
	* Marius has a strong drug addiction of which no one save Galadnor Half-Elven (see 4-31) is aware, but it has not yet affected his abilities.

		* Three tapestries line the walls, showing scenes of ritual sacrifice and the domination of the weak.
		* On the stands are a pristine Set armor +2 (av items), spear +1, long sword +1.

Lacedaion of Archontos
* Brilliant but insecure, he harbors resentment about Marius’s aristocratic status.
* Belisarius the Overseer has been trying to persuade Lacedaion that Stephania has been slighting him.
	* Although aware of Belisarius’s antipathy for the high priestess, Lacedaion’s vanity and resentment have pushed him a bit further along the path of treason than his intellect would normally allow.
* Lacedaion is a short, dark man with a stylish goatee, piercing eyes, and a scar running along his left cheek.
	* He wears flashy and extravagant red velvet robes at almost all times, eschewing his formal Set armor +2 unless preparing for a fight.

### 4-58: Blocked Passage and Dangerous Room

* Several bits of broken column block the hallway outside this door (locked).
	* Glued to one fragment is a large note (Archontean): “No access per order of High Priestess Stephania.”
	* Close listeners at the door hear a whispered suggestion (Archontean): “Help me. I am so lonely. I will be your friend.”  Save versus spells or believe the voice and try to open the door.
	* The chamber contains a succubus, still posing problems for Stephania and her cult.
		* The door has a powerful protection against evil spell on it, refreshed every week via an elaborate ceremony.  It is secured against teleportation and ethereal travel.
* This former administrative chamber hosts a dozen desks and tables, as well as a row of scroll and map cabinets.
	* A scattering of 18 gp can be collected after two turns of searching.
	* Among tedious administrative documents (lists of supplies, payments, etc.) are 2 scrolls (cone of cold; knit bones (new)), and a charter sealed by Stephania (4-51).
		* The charter promises a bounty of 200 gp per varumani head to a certain Kallion the White (see 8-15).  It could be used to convince the troll thegn (7-30) to aid in a protracted campaign against Set.

		* "Unguents piled on high, Bones wrapped and entombed, There Theskelon rests." (it refers to the tomb of Theskelon, 4-142).
		* The deacons who recorded it did not recognize its significance before they were driven from the chamber.
	* Secret Door (north, to 4-59, locked): Stephania (4-51) holds the sole key.

* Currently home to a succubus calling herself Maris, accidentally summoned by Herbert, a (former) deacon of Set.
	* She is bound to the chamber and to the body of the unfortunate deacon, who she  delights in impersonating via her shape change ability.
	* She slew the deacons Stephania sent to handle her and turned them into wights.
	* Although she has enjoyed the game of torment with the priesthood of Set, Maris is deeply annoyed at her imprisonment.  She is eager to escape in order to wreak chaos in the Forum.
	* The wights are mindless, but they obey Maris as long as they are within sight of her.

Maris the succubus, posing as Herbert the deacon: SZ M; AL CE; AC 0; MV 120’, 180’ flying (Class C); HD 6; HP 40; #AT 2; Dmg 1-3/1-3; MR 70%. Constant abilities: infravision.

### 4-59: Shadowy Trouble

* A pack of shadows occupy this unfinished chamber.
	* It was only partially excavated when disaster struck Arden Vul; the shadows are the remains of slaves entombed here when the priests of Set fled.
	* The east wall was painted a rough, but clear painting of Set in his Set animal form.
		* It was debased by the dying slaves, who scrawled (in various tongues) “Murderer!”, “Lord of Deceit”, and so forth.
	* The once brightly-painted south wall of the chamber now shows only smears of blood and other foul fluids.  The floor is paved except for a 3’ belt of unfinished stone along the west wall.
	* The river flows east through an extremely swift and narrow tunnel only 4’ in diameter (passage would batter for 6d10, before emerging at 4-68).
	* A war hammer +1 lies in the debris.
		* Its handle is broken and requires 100 gp of work by a high-quality smith.
	* Secret Door (south, to 4-58, locked): easy to detect (1 in 4) due to the hammer marks that cover it.  The sole key is held by High Priestess Stephania (4-51).
* Lying on the pavement are the long-rotted, desiccated, and sometimes gnawed remains of the entombed.
	* Amid the bones of one is a short written testimonial (in Goblin Runic) describing the last days of the slaves.

14 shadows: SZ M; AL CE; AC 7; MV 120; HD 3+3; HP 24, 23, 22, 21, 20(x3), 19(x3), 18, 18, 17, 16; #AT 1; Dmg 2-5. Special attacks: STR drain. Special defenses: 90% undetectable; +1 or

		* Each guard has a stash of 10d10 sp.
	* A large mural shows the Long Stair (4-19) and a company of Set Guardsmen escorting a variety of prisoners.
		* Inspection shows the faces of the prisoners are individualized, including one that looks very much like Belisarius the Overseer (4-47).
			* These reflect the true enemies of this sept of guardsmen, past and present.
			* If the party is an enemy of the cult, the GM might decide that one of the PCs’ faces appears on the mural.
* Most of the time only four guardsmen are present here.

4 elite Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 3rd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 26, 25, 25, 24; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow). Special defense: fanaticism.

	* A barrel-vaulted, brick-lined ceiling rises 25’ above the floor; the walls are covered by heavy red drapes.
		* The western transept, hidden by the drapery, has a huge oil portrait of Stephania (4-51), as well as two chairs and a table, on which sits a scrying ball (new) keyed to the Forum of Set (4-2).
		* The east transept, hidden by drapery, holds a guard chamber, where four of the elite temple guards from 4-60 wait.
	* At the south end of the chapel is an obsidian altar stained with blood, on which rest an ancient obsidian knife, a copper bowl and a copper goblet (250 gp for all).
		* Hidden compartment in the altar (trapped with poison gas): the boar’s helm, a lesser artifact of Set (new).  The current cult is ignorant of the helm.
	* Secret Door (in eastern corridor, leading to 4-36): This door is 4’x2.5’ in size, and difficult to locate (1 in 8). It opens to those who knock four times in rapid succession on the door. The current Set cult is ignorant of this door. 
* The chapel exudes a strong aura of evil (evil beings save at +2, good beings at -2).
	* Set is also more likely to hear invocations to him in this chamber and to send a lesser devil to aid his supplicants.
* 25% chance a ritual is taking place; if so, it involves High Priestess Stephania and two Set deacons.

4 elite Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 3rd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 26, 25, 25, 24; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow).

* The magic user Pelagion the Grey lives in this hidden chamber.

		* Chest #1: Pelagion’s spell book, five blank scrolls, and a scroll (Pelagion’s bridge of sighs, new), the spell book of Visby.
			* Visby was a mage caught in the Forum spying for the Drome, traded to the lizardmen of SL5. He is currently languishing at SL5-34.
		* Chest #2: A full stock of alchemical ingredients and material components (1,000 gp total), 8 doses of arcanum jelly (new), a glass activation squares (black and yellow).
* Pelagion has two hellhounds for company and protection.

Pelagion the Grey
* Pelagion is young (35), but exposure to arcanum has caused unusually deep age-lines on his face and a premature change in hair color (to snowy white).
* Pelagion is studying the arcanum deposit in 4-63, allegedly to provide Belisarius (4-47) with an edge against Stephania (4-51), but really to further his own arcane interests.
	* He has been living here for a year studying the substance. 
	* He recognizes the potential dangers of extended exposure to arcanum and has taken to breaking off chunks of the stuff for study in the relative safety of 4-62.
* He hops around with manic energy on one leg (the other is withered) and loves nothing more than to expound on the many benefits of arcanum.
	* In a stroke of arcanum-fueled inspiration, he has developed 2 new spells (recorded in his spell book) and a formula for a potion that temporarily enhances INT (clarity), not written down for fear of theft.
	* In addition physical scars of his time with arcanum, he has become increasingly eccentric: talking to himself in bizarre languages both real and fantastic, licking rock in an (unsuccessful) effort to determine its taste and properties, and generally acting in an unstable way.
* If approached from the north (the caves), he appears cautious but eager to trade knowledge about arcanum.  If approached from the south without Belisarius, he is hostile.

		* Kaledon is obsequious, offering to serve his rescuers (planning to betray them to recover his favor in the cult).

	* Digging in the sand turns up the rusted remains of an ancient battle: 1-6 ruined weapons and 1-8 bits of unusable armor.

### 4-83: Small Cave

* This cave is rocky, uneven, and difficult to traverse, appearing as a dead end at first.
	* The exit to the south (towards 4-63) is hidden behind a rock spur.

* The chamber worked-stone walls were once painted, but now coated merely with smears of mildewed color.
	* The slick floor has been paved with slate flagstones.
	* A great roaring sound comes from river, especially from the area to the east (4-65). 
	* A 6’-diameter ring of mosaic tiles showing piscine scenes is inlaid on the floor near the western wall.
		* Nestled among the fish is the inscription (in Mithric): ‘What do you require?’
		* Speaking the command phrase (Mithric) “I require transport” causes a new ‘egg’ to appears magically on the mosaic.
	* Against the north wall rest two egg-shaped vessels some 8’ tall and 6’ wide.
		* They appear made of leather or hide and both feature a 4’-square flap. 
		* One egg has two loose ancient octagonal platinum coins.
		* Inside each egg, three seats attached to the walls and a small metal cube is attached to the ‘floor’, with a fish-shaped indentation on top.
* 3 medium creatures can squeeze into an eggs and be launched into the river.
	* Without a stabilizing control rod inserted into the fish-shaped indentation on the cube, this will likely prove fatal as the occupants are thrown about as the egg plummets down the chute (4-65) and into the river on Level 5.
	* With a control rod, the egg remains perfectly stable despite the roughness of its passage.
	* The remaining control rods are at 3-67, 4-2d, 5-102, 7-76c, 8-146, 9-33, and SL4-40f.  Kerbog Khan also has a number of control rods in his possession at any given time (see SL12-23).

	* A light breeze runs upwards in the direction of 3-115.

### 4-89: Golden Monkey

* This large cavern is moist, cool, and empty.
	* A strange, solid gold, statuette of a monkey (2000 gp) was abandoned by an adventurer on a ledge in the southwestern corner.
		* The monkey has four sets of limbs: legs in the lotus position, while three sets of arms cover its ears, eyes, and mouth respectively.
		* A huge single eye, inset with lapis lazuli, is set in its rotund belly.
		* Its base is inscribed (Mithric) “Victory!”.
		* The monkey is cursed (detects of magic and chaos): the first to pick it up goes deaf, dumb and blind unless covering the eye on its belly when picking it up.

### 4-90: Crystalline Growths and Tunnel Down to 7-118

* Colossal columns of gypsum crisscross the chamber.
	* The temperature here is quite hot (~120F) and the humidity is close to 100%.
	* Embedded amid the growths is a brightly lit silver bell some 3’ in diameter (400 lbs, 400 gp, continual light enchantment).
* Four selenite guardians tend the cave, and will be upset if intruders disturb the gypsum (e.g. to recover the bell).
	* They will remonstrate in their own language, but attack if unable to communicate.
* The tunnel to the west leads downward 900’ to 7-118.

4 selenite guardians (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 30’ on dirt, 60’ on selenite; HD 6; HP 41, 37, 36, 35; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/2-8. Special defenses: regenerate 2 HP/round near

### 4-94: Misty Cave

* This damp and misty cave drops 20’ from the main tunnel.
	* Visibility is only 10’ in the mist.
	* At the cave entrance is a petrified Set guardsman, caught trying to cover his eyes.

Ludrig’s appearance at the varumani court (7-75) would create a major stir; still, once his identity was established, many varumani would shun him as a collaborator.

### 4-96: Xorn Feeding Zone

* This chamber is 8 degrees colder than the surrounding caves, fertile conditions for a psychotropic pale-blue lichen, blue haze (flora), covering walls, floor, and ceiling.
	* 2 xorn have become addicted to the lichen and wandered the chamber in a drugged stupor, snacking aimlessly on the lichen (20 doses present).
	* The xorn respond to offers of gems or precious metals, but attack those who disturb their stash (i.e., the lichen).

* Among the stalks dwell 8 fungal foresters; not necessarily hostile.

##### 4-97a: Sunken Pit

* This area is sunken 20’ below the floor of the main mushroom cave.

Crazy-Man Michael, an insane Archontean ex-slave: SZ M; AL N; AC 9; MV 120’; HD 1-1; HP 4; #AT 1; Dmg 1-3 (bone knife). 

##### 4-97b: Ledge 

* This ledge is 20’ above the floor of the fungus cave and is covered with two varieties of lichen, one red and one grey.
	* These lichen are symbiotic; when in large enough concentrations (as here), they can issue a telepathic collective thought-impulse to all those within a 10’ radius.
		* The lichen-mind is rather alien, and must be successfully understood before negotiation can occur.
	* The lichen will demand passage (in 10’-diameter sections of each species) to a new location (e.g. the Great Cavern 3-162, 3-172) in return for information.
		* The information is can impart is the location of a ‘being like you, although silent.’  They refer to a limed-over skeleton at the far north of their ledge, difficult to notice without help.
		* It takes several hours of careful scraping and suitable carrying cases, collect the lichen.  It will be quite particular about their new home: it must be cool, not too busy, and not too out-of-the-way.
	* The skeleton is of a hero of the ancient age, Chramn the Hunter, who died of wounds incurred in fighting a basilisk (now dead).
		* Two-handed sword +2, a basilisk horn, and an imperial rescript, carefully folded up in a leather pouch.
			* The rescript reads (Mithric): “What the bearer has done, he has done for the good of the Empire. Signed, L., Logothete of the Drome”.

* GM Note: The rescript is of potentially enormous value, as it could easily be used by unscrupulous parties to justify all manner of actions in the name of the Drome.
	* Should a current logothete of the Drome become aware of this usage, a reckoning will be in order.
	* Leonidas was logothete of the Drome in Archontos in the year 1653 AEP.

Telepathic lichen (see above).

### 4-98: Lair of the Boalisk

* An albino boalisk makes its home in a cave located just to the east of the pond.
	* This dangerous predator is fearless and willing to take on large potential prey.
	* Its familiarity with the area gives it a +1 chance to surprise.

1 albino boalisk (40%): SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 5+1; HP 33; #AT 2; Dmg 1-3/2-7. Special attacks: constriction; gaze attack causes mummy rot.

### 4-100: Escaped Slaves

* A small group of slaves, escaped from the clutches of the cult of Set, have established a community here in this pair of caves that open 30’ above the clear pond (4-99).
	 	* A fire made of mushroom stalks crackles in the western-most ell of the cave, producing lots of smoke.  Mushroom stalk torches (taken from 4-97) hang near the entrance and in the northern ell.
	* The community has stolen or looted several important items.
		* A large keg of lamp oil (2/3 used); some jury-rigged cookware (made of helmets and the like), a barrel of dried meat, 4 suits of red Set armor (av items), 4 long swords, 2 short swords, a dozen knives, a wand of enemy detection (20 charges), and a wand of fire (10 charges). 
		* Aside from the weapons listed above, they are armed with bone clubs and simple spears.
* There are 25 individuals; mostly human commoners, but with 3 goblins, 1 lizardman, and a beastman (sheep brother).
	* The leaders of the community are three classed individuals.
		* Theophrastus, a peaceful cleric, was taken by a Set patrol out in the valley below the Halls, and is largely ignorant of the Halls save for the Precincts of Set.
		* Jostri and Hexameros are adventurers who worked their way (separately) into the Halls from the cliff face (EX-15).
	* The community is fiercely protective of its members, but anxious to escape the Halls.
		* They have established a fairly safe but still precarious life; fishing in the pond (avoiding the boalisk in 4-98), harvesting fungi and lichen from 4-97, and occasionally hunting lizards or ambushing Set patrols in the surrounding caves.
		* When venturing out, they always travel in groups of five, each group carrying one of four bone whistles crafted by Jostri.  If they run into difficulties, they blow the whistle and bring the classed leaders running (cautiously) to assist. 
		* If the boalisk (4-98) is proven to be defeated, the community will be extremely grateful, treating the heroes as having +4 CHA.
	* The leaders will negotiate happily with good-aligned PCs, exchanging labor, information and possibly one or both wands for food, and aid departing the Halls.
		* They might ask for help ‘saving’ their former comrade, now known sadly, but affectionately, as Crazy-Man Michael (4-97a); sadly he cannot be saved.
		* They know about the exit down the Long Stairs (4-19), but have been unable to figure out a plan to sneak past the Forum of Set.

## 4-101 to 4-104: Ambassadors’ Residences

* A set of chambers just off the Forum, reserved for the lodging of important ambassadors.
	* The hallway, common area, and individual rooms all feature 20’ ceilings.
	* The common area outside the chambers is furnished with two low coffee tables, a small cabinet, wall hangings with a few bits of promotional imagery, and eight comfortable chairs, two sized for large creatures.
		* Hangings: an ornate scroll paen to the greatness of Set; a series of illustrations of great moments in the cult of Set, the plucking of a sad-looking ibis, etc.
	* Two of the chambers have spy holes for the priests of Set to spy on their guests.
	* The Set cult typically uses the ‘gift’ of residence in these chambers as a way of wooing important or powerful guests.
		* Those from weaker cultures or institutions are flatly rebuffed, as are those subject to the cult’s casual racism (no goblins or lizardmen here).
		* Powerful, high-level, PCs who have done favors for (or promised favors to) the cult might - might! - be permitted to stay here.

### 4-101: Emissaries from the Troll Thegn

* Four varumani (three lesser, one true) reside here as quasi-permanent ambassadors from the court of the troll thegn (see 7-75).
	* The walls are a neutral ochre color so as not to offend.
	* Four beds; a table with dice, cards, and several bottles of good ale; waste pails; a locked chest; and the services of a goblin slave.
		* Chest (locked): 10 1-lb platinum bars (250 gp each), a sack of 143 ancient gold solidi, 10 passes to the troll thegn’s court (av items), a periapt of proof against poison, a wand of detect lie (56 charges), and a rudishva communication array (tech) they use to report back to the thegn.
	* A set of spy holes is concealed in the stonework of the east wall (see 4-101a). 
* The lesser varumani defer to the true varumani, Yoburra, the one entrusted with actual diplomacy, being far smarter than his lesser cousins.
	* The lesser varumani have devised a dartboard out of their previous servant, a human named Max.
	* All four see this posting as a joke; none of them respect the Set priests.
		* They enjoy lolling around, pretending to care about the machinations of the Set cult.  They do pay close attention to first-time visitors to the forum, ready to keep the thegn apprised of potential threats and/or potential allies.

3 lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58, 57, 52; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (mattock, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-
affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: mattocks.

Yoburra, a true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword, ring mail., chest key

1 goblin slave named Quarm: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

##### 4-101a: Spy Passages

* These narrow, rough passages allow the Set cult to spy on emissaries in 4-101 and 4-102.
	* The stairs descending to area 4-19 are unusually steep.
	* A wooden shelf set in the wall between the two sets of spy holes holds a stylus, inkpot, and unbound parchment quire.
		* The folios of the quire are divided into two columns, one entitled ‘trolls’ and the other ‘giants’.
			* The observations are mostly mundane, with a few of interest.
			* Folio 7: the varumani emissaries talked about the plans of Varboka, the troll thegn (7-30), to enslave the goblins.
				* Worth 4,500 gp to King Weskenim (SL4-22).
			* Folio 6: the giant emissaries have decided to accept the offer of alliance tendered by the high priestess (4-51) and to initiate attacks against the Archontean outposts beginning in the next harvest season.
				* Worth 5,000 gp to Keko the Lame in Narsileon.
	* Showing the spy notes to the giants brings mere shrugs; they expect that sort of thing.  Showing them to the varumani causes Varboka to withdraw his emissaries and to prepare for conflict with the Set cult.
		* GM Note: Stephania’s proposed alliance with the giants could be used to develop further adventures outside of Arden Vul.
	* Secret Door (east): easy to locate from this side (1 in 4), pulled inward to open.
* 25% chance a low-ranking member of the Guild of Service is here, spying.

1 guildsman, as a 2nd-level male Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL LE; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 16; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (spears, clubs). Possessions: leather armor; spear; and club. Special: he 
has +1 to damage from STR.

### 4-102: Giant Emissaries

* Two frost giant ambassadors are resident here.
	* Two beds, a chest, a table and two chairs, a huge polar bear fleece, two bundles of animal skins/rugs, and waste pails.
		* The beds are too small, and the giants have pushed them together to make a lounging area, on which sleeps their pet winter wolf.
		* Chest: wand of frost (32 charges), 50 pieces of amber (50 gp each), a mixed pile of coins (300 gp), a keg of fiery brandy, giant-sized equipment; winter wolf pelt (500 gp).
	* They have had their winter wolf spray frost throughout it to make it more homey.
	* A set of spy holes is concealed in the stonework of the east wall (see 4-101A).
* Hjall and Hedin are secretive and largely stay in their chamber.
	* The giants do not like the varumani, nor do they particularly care for the Set priests.
	* Officially sent by their jarl to negotiate an alliance with Set against the Archontean empire (see 4-101a).
		* They have a secondary motive: the jarl’s wife, with the gift of sight, has predicted a dangerous potential ally or enemy will appear in the Forum in the next three months.  This ally or enemy will be a female human (or half-elven) magic user with raven-black hair.
			* They aren’t sure what the premonition is about, but have orders to seize the object of the premonition and return with her to the jarl.
			* Any human mage who fits these features may be in danger.
	* They don’t like having to stay underground and are anxious to find the subject of the premonition and beat a retreat.

Hjall and Hedin, frost giants: SZ L; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 10+1-4; HP 72, 68; #AT 1; Dmg 4-24. Special attacks: hurl rocks (2-20 dmg). Special defenses: immune to cold.

## Level 4: 105 - 106

### 4-105: Stair of Commerce with Niches 

* This broad, 20’-wide stairs rises from the chasm of Set (4-119) to the Forum itself (4-2).
	* It provides the primary access to the Forum from both outside and within Arden Vul.
	* The marble stairs, worn down the center by the tread of countless feet over the centuries, are brightly lit with continual light.
	* 6 semi-circular niches line the stair; each holds an impressive 5'-tall stone bust of a former Set priest atop a 5'-tall stone table.
		* They depict youthful humans in an otherworldly, idealized way (wide eyes, vacant gazes, smooth faces, etc.), the modern style of imperial portraiture, as opposed to super-realistic style of the old empire.
			* Two are female, one wears a skullcap, a few boast scarves, and one is depicted in a cylindrical headdress.
		* They are the six most important high priests of Set since the cult’s modern resurgence some 90 years ago.
	* Secret Door (west): in the niche occupied by the bust of Cilicius Gresto, a high priest of Set from some fifty years in the past.
		* Pressing a button in the fold of Cilicius’s scarf opens the 4' square door.  It leads to a short passage and another secret door (see 4-110).
* 20% chance of encountering another group on the stairs.
	* 33% a squad of Set guardsmen with a sergeant, 66% a group of visitors (roll on Table 1 at area 4-2).
	* The guardsmen will take little interest in the party unless it acts with hostility.
	* Visitors’ reactions should be determined normally.

Possible Inhabitants:

		* The Set cult has barred this door to the third mystery due to its inability to defeat the behir (4-111).
	* Keys to the door are held by the leaders of the cult of Set (4-51, 4-47, 4-56, 4-57).

## Level 4: 107 to 111

* These rooms are dark, silent, and filled with inches of dust.
	* Several sets of footprints run from 4-106 to 4-111, still filled with decades of dust.
	* The only recemt tracks are those of the behir (4-111), a giant constrictor snake (4-109), and dozens of small normal-sized lizards.

### 4-107: Open Door and Warning

* The door to this chamber is open about a foot.  Subtle serpent tracks enter it.
* This former residential suite has clearly not been used in centuries. 
	* Broken furniture lies everywhere, covered in piles of dust.
	* Inspection shows some of it is scorched.
	* An enormous serpent skin (of a 15’ snake) lies in the dust.

### 4-108: Shattered and Charred Door

* This wooden door hangs crazily on its hinges.
	* It is very old and shows signs of being blasted apart and scorched by electricity.

### 4-109: Serpent’s Lair

* The door to this chamber is locked and stuck (blocked from inside by a pile of debris).
* Once the high priest’s sumptuously decorated chamber, it is now lair to an enormous giant python, the descendant of one of the sacrificial serpents now living in symbiosis with the behir.
	* The serpent’s nest is littered with bones, mostly small and reptilian, but several large and mammalian.
		* -1 attack from the jumble of brittle bones and desiccated furniture.
		* Among the bones: 26 gp, 37 sp, a garnet (50 gp), an emerald (300 gp), a snapped wand of magic missiles, a dagger of venom, and a guard cap (new).

		* Center: a huge serpent emerges from a hole in a wall, while the red-garbed priest raises a large knife.
		* Eastern end: the priest stands atop of the snake's corpse, holding the knife and the snake’s decapitated head over his head.
		* Above the images is written (Mithric): “Set vanquishes the serpent.”
	* The western wall has crumbled, and a 5’-diameter hole allows access to natural tunnels beyond.

1 giant constrictor snake (50% chance): SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6+1; HP 39; #AT 2; Dmg 1-4/2-8. Special attacks: constriction.

X / 39

### 4-110: Preparation Chamber

* Here the high priest conducted the preparatory rituals (including propitious sacrifices and ablutions) prior to conducting the third mystery. 
	* Western side: a dry, sunken pool (3’ deep, 8’ square) occupies the center.
		* The preferred place for the giant constrictor snake to eliminate larger prey.
		* The pool is filled with various bones.
			* Mixed in: a pair of insalubrious-looking boots of insulation (new).
	* Eastern side: broken furniture, a painted screen, and a variety of ratty robes and ceremonial clothes.
	* Center: opposite the entrance passage is a marble altar (4’ tall, 3’ wide, and 6’ long).
		* It bears ancient dried bloodstains.
	* South wall: a mural of the third mystery, with a red-robed high priest stabbing a serpent with an exaggeratedly large dagger.
* The mural and some furniture are damaged (scorched and blasted).

(25%) giant constrictor snake: for stats see 4-109.

### 4-111: 3rd Mystery of Set: The Ritual of the Slaying of the Serpent

* The third of the great mysteries of the cult of Set took place of old in this large cavern.
	* Now it is the territory of a behir, which the priests of Set are unable to dislodge.
	* To the chagrin of Stephania, the third mystery has not been performed since antiquity.
* The chamber of the mystery includes two areas, a worked area and a natural cavern area.
	* The worked area opens from the corridor into a 20’ x 30’ area paved with white and black marble.
		* The western edge of this pavement is 10’ above the floor of the cavern, set off by a low balustrade (3’) of marble.
		* The pavement is covered by centuries of dust, disturbed only by slither marks.
		* Marble stairs lead down to a semi-circle of mosaic covered with dirt and dust.
			* Numerous tracks cross it - rodent, serpent, and lizard (behir) tracks.
			* If swept clean, the mosaic shows Set wielding a ritual dagger and holding the corpse of a huge serpent.
	* The natural area extends in an arc around the mosaic, culminating in a rocky western wall perforated by numerous holes.
		* Most of the holes seem fit for rats or snakes.  There is one larger one on the southwestern face.
		* Three low knobs rise from rocky floor (3-5’ high). 
		* The rough ceiling rises 35’ from the cavern floor.
		* Searching the natural area reveals 6 skeletons, picked clean by rats.
			* One is the high priest before Stephania (Keladorus of Arcturos), a brave fool who attempted to enter the chamber and best the behir.
				* Ring of Set named Fragas (new), a scroll (curse item, new), a copper, jade, and lapis necklace (200 gp).
				* Nearby under inches of dust: the sacred ritual dagger of the Third Mystery rests (1,000 gp to the cult of set; 50 gp to others).
			* 3 are the high priest’s guards (x3), still in Set armor (av items) blasted by powerful energy.
			* 2 skeletons are ancient; a pair of adventurers.
				* Long sword +1, 3 arrows of striking (new) stuffed in a wooden scroll case; blasted and useless chain mail, a pouch with 3 potions (invisibility, clairvoyance, clairaudience), a rotting sack with 179 gp.

The Third Mystery
* In antiquity a high priest would re-enact the dramatic mythological moment in which Set slew the great serpent, Apep, and in so doing became the protector of humanity.
* In emulation of this event, and with an audience of cultists and visitors watching from the pavement, the high priest would descend to the mosaic and slay a semi-wild snake driven from one of the cliff holes by a specially-trained snake-handler.
	* Marking oneself in its blood would confer Set's blessing and power.
* When the Set cult returned to Arden Vul in the past century, it found that a behir had invaded the area; efforts to drive off the behir have failed.
	* This beast was sent by Apep to scorn Set's "mastery" of serpents.

24 giant rats: SZ S; AL N(E); AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4(x6), 3(x6), 2(x6), 1(x6); #At 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: 5% chance of disease.

## Level 4: 112 - 120

### 4-112: Lair of the Behir

* The behir makes its lair in this set of caverns and tunnels.
	* The area is notably cooler and moister than other areas of Level 4. 
	* The large caves are maze of rocky projections, dangerous fissures, and small pools of water.  The rough, uneven floor is extremely difficult for humanoids to navigate.
	* The terrain has made it all the harder for the Set cult to dislodge the behir.
* The behir will initially in 4-111, 4-112c, 4-113, 4-114, or 4-115 (equal chance for each).
	* Unless exceptionally stealthy, the behir will hear people clambering into the tunnel to 4-112a and will arrive in 1-4 rounds to aggressively defend its territory.
	* It would take great skill and luck to surprise the behir in 4-112c.
	* If the behir is bloodied (50% HP), it retreats into the mist in 4-115.

##### 4-112a: Larder

* This open cavern stinks terribly of decaying meat.
* It rises 10’ feet from the tunnel to 4-111 before dropping off to the west and south.  This elevation change and the slick rock formations make it hard to navigate.
	* Sound in the chamber attracts the behir in 1-4 rounds.
* Numerous skeletal and fleshly remains are scattered in nooks and crannies.
	* Most are rats and other small dungeon vermin, but a few are human-sized.

* Tracking can discern the behir's regular passage through the northern portion of the cave (to reach the rats at 4-111).

##### 4-112b: Dripping Cave

* This wide, rocky cavern has a 5’-wide tunnel leading to a hole in the cliff face (4-111).
	* There are signs of the behir’s passing.

##### 4-112c: Lair

* The behir makes its main lair in this cave.
	* There is a pool of fresh water in the southwest extension.
	* The tunnel from 4-112a rises 15’ and culminates in a narrow, 4'-tall squeeze into the main chamber at 4-112c.

1 behir: SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 150’; HD 12; HP 85; #AT 2 or 7; damage 2-8/2-5 or 2-8/1-6(x6). Special attacks: lightning bolt. Special defenses: immune to electricity and poison.
* In Gullet: 16 aquamarines (100 gp each), 3 tiger eyes (10 gp each), 5 moonstones (50 gp each); a large gold comb studded with citrines (7,000 gp); a silver-and-gold toe ring (1,100 gp), and a periapt of proof against poison.

### 4-113: Bright Cave

* The long tunnel from 4-112a snakes downward 60’ to this cavern.
	* It is lit by a fluorescent glow from a strange variety of mold growing on the rocks.
		* The fluorescence is calming and peaceful.  Those entering must save vs spells or fall into a stupor lasting 4-8 turns.
		* The behir or giant python might arrive while one or more PCs are dazed.

### 4-114: Pool

* This cavern is filled with a 30’-deep pool of clear water. 
	* Western exit: near the ceiling of the cavern, 20’ above the water level.  Unwary folk might walk off the ledge and into the water. 
	* Northern exit: leads to a long, snaky tunnel that rises over many rocky projections before reaching 4-116. 
	* Southern exit: a small tunnel 15’ above the water level that leads to a hole in the wall of the chasm of Set (4-121).
		* The chasm access is 20’ below that of the platforms (4-119 and 4-120).

### 4-115: Mist-Filled Cave

* The stone of this cavern is composed of unusual concentrations of iron, strontium, and arcanum (new) which has lent it some strange features.
	* A heavy mist occupies both lobes of the cave, appearing almost solid, as if molecules of ore were precipitating in and out of a gaseous state.
		* Light shining on the mist will show a shimmering veil of glinting, crackling, quasi-opaque ‘vapor’.
		* The mist is restorative to the behir (healing it 1d6 / round) and absorbing a charge from it.
			* This shocks others in the mist each round (save for half): 2d8 if the behir is present, or 1d4 from residual charge if it is absent.
		* Beings (other than the behir) must save vs doom or be teleported with a flash of electricity (roll each person's destination separately).
			* 1) island in the lake, Level 3 (3-164a)
			* 2) random cave in Sub-Level 3
			* 3) the pyramid of Thoth, surface ruins (AV-15)
			* 4) the floor of the Great Chasm (9-1)
			* 5) the Hall of Forty Columns (5-6)
			* 6) GM’s choice
		* Those carrying at least 1 lb of arcanum are immune to both shock and translocation by the mists.
	* At the far end of the southeastern lobe is an 8”-tall solid gold statuette of a camel (new), dropped by a previous visitor.

(20%) 1 behir: for stats see 4-112c.

### 4-116: Lichen Cave

* This wide spot in the tunnels is damp and slick.
	* A yellow lichen grows all over the walls and ceiling. It glows softly, imparting a bit of light to the chamber and is harmless and surprisingly nutritious.

### 4-117: Tunnel Down to 5-117

* The tunnel forks here, with one branch ending in a slight spur and the other sloping downward sharply to form a steep tunnel that leads to 5-117.
	* The spur ends in a ledge, near the ceiling (hard to detect), on which is a skeleton of an ancient hero of Set, still wearing its rusted red chain mail.
		* It bears a mace of enforced harmony (new), a pouch (31 ancient silver pennies, 11 ancient gold solidi).

### 4-118: Forgotten Hall

* A long-forgotten priest planned this austere hall as the initial stage of his never-completed tomb complex.
	* A dais rises 5’ in three steps at the north end.
	* The walls are undecorated.  A cave-in has revealed a 5’-diameter tunnel to the north.
		* The passage links to the chasm (4-121) 30’ above that of the landings (4-119 and 4-120).
	* The floor is littered with small, gray, knob-like objects.
		* They are digested remnants of chasm cephalopods consumed by the hungry lurker above that dwells here.
	* The lurker above waits for all to enter, but it is so hungry it may leap too early (50%).
		* It surprises on a 1-5.
		* In the creature’s gullet is a badly corroded gold and silver coronet (50 gp).

1 lurker above: SZ L; AL N; AC 6; MV 10’, 90’ flying (Class D); HD 10; HP 68; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: surprise 4 in 6; constriction; suffocation. Special defenses: 90% undetectable 
against stone.

### 4-119: North Landing

* This landing is floored in bright mosaics depicting each of the three mysteries of Set and other elements of his iconography.
	* A shimmering, transparent field runs across the width of the landing, 10’ from the edge of the chasm.
		* It is impenetrable from the south, but fully permeable from the north.
		* The command word 'shield' causes the field to fade for 5 rounds.  This is well known to the cult of Set.
	* At the north foot of the bridge is a square of marble incised with lapis lazuli letters (Mithric) on which a random riddle appears:
		* First Riddle: I shelter brave men. With my bloody back I ward off blows, thwarting spears, giving life to some. I lay my body against my lord’s left hand.
		* Second Riddle: I’m by nature solitary, scarred by spear and wounded by sword, weary of battle. Battered by the face of war, my strength holds back hateful enemies. 
	* Delaying in front of the field may (25%) draw a pod of chasm cephalopods.

6 small chasm cephalopods (see new monsters) (25% chance): SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 2; HP 14, 13, 13, 12, 11, 8; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-3/1-3/1-4; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

##### 4-120a: Red Bridge of Set

* This 8’-wide stone bridge is one of the iconic locations in Arden Vul.
	* Constructed of red granite, it is slender, rising effortlessly above the chasm, anchored on either landing by 8’-tall marble pillars.
	* Balustrades (4’ tall) carved in the shape of standing Set animals flank the bridge.
	* Unless magically dampened, footfalls echo loudly across the chasm.
		* 50% likely to alert the guards at 4-123 and 4-124 of the approach of visitors.

## Level 4: 121 - 135

### 4-121: Chasm of Set

* The chasm drops 100’ below the level of the bridge (4-12), and rises about 50’ above it.
	* The walls are rocky and uneven, and numerous forms of lichen and moss grow here. 
	* The chasm is moist and humid; the sound of dripping echoes loudly throughout.
		* The floor of the chasm is covered by 15’ feet of water. 
			* Numerous small treasures have fallen here over the years (see below).
			* Below the water, a stone archway is cut into the side of the wall and covered by a shimmering veil of energy.
				* The veil is permeable.  Those who enter are instantly transported either to 1) the Roiling Lake (9-65), or 2) the Drowned Cavern (SL6-24) or 3) the elemental plane of water.
				* A pack of lacedons defends the hidden gate.
					* The cult of Set knows of the ghouls, but not the gate.
	* The chasm is home to a small community of chasm cephalopods (those slain elsewhere (e.g., 4-119, 4-120) should be subtracted from this total).
* Note: If the submerged door at AV-39 has been opened, and the southern portion of the swamp drained, the chasm at 4-121 will contain much more water, its level only 30’ below the bridge (4-120a) and landings (4-119 and 4-120).

The treasures in the chasm are hard to locate, and explorating attracts the ghouls.  Some discoveries include:
* A 1’-diameter sphere of platinum inset with jet, garnet, and ivory realistically depicting the continents and islands of Magae (5,000 gp)
* Scattered coins: 119 ancient silver pennies and 71 ancient gold solidi, 53 sp, 27 gp, and 9 pp.
* A crude statuette of a penguin carved from volcanic rock, with two huge jet gems for eyes (250 gp each for the gems, 650 gp for the statuette)
* A metal shield +2
* An icon of kauket (new)
* Acursed blacklight torch (new)
* A scrying ball hidden inside a clay jar (new)
* A wand of alignment detection (43 charges) (new)
* An obsidian skull of comprehension (new).
* (east end of the chasm) a 2’-long, 1”-diameter iron bar (the 3rd lever from 4-127).

6 medium chasm cephalopods (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 4; HP 27, 26, 25, 24, 24, 22; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-4/1-4/1-6; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

12 lacedons: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’, 90’ swimming; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 14, 13(x3), 12(x3), 10, 9, 9; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

### 4-122: Thothian Teleportation Ring

* A Thothian teleporation ring is set in the floor here (address: BK-RE-BL-WH-YE-GR).
	* No glass activation squares are present.
	* The Set cult is ignorant of it's function, though they know it is powerful magic.

##### 4-122a: Secret Doors and Hidden Staircase to AV-39

* Just south of the landing area are a pair of secret doors.
	* Secret Door (east): opens by inserting a rod into a 1" ceiling hole.  Leads to 4-148.
	* Secret Door (west, locked, -5% to pick): hard to spot (1 in 8).  Key was lost ages ago.
		* It leads to a dusty chamber with a stone spiral staircase that rises 650’ to a ruined cellar in the surface ruins (AV-39).

### 4-123: Guard Chamber

* A detachment of 4 Set guardsmen and an acolyte is on duty here at all times.
	* The chamber is decorated in bright yellow and blue primary colors.
	* The insignia of each military sept of the cult is painted on a wall: the black boar, a head with white face and red hair, and a tornado.
	* A circular table, some benches, two water barrels, several sets of dice (one loaded), a dartboard, and a good supply of jerky.
* They keep the door half-open so as to hear any visitors to the halls of Set.
	* Visitors who are not aggressive will be asked their business.
		* If the acolyte is content that nothing is awry, they read out the Laws of the Forum and a few other random warnings (“Don’t go poking your noses into the private areas”, “Show respect to the Black Boar”, “Watch out for the Breath of Set”, etc.).
		* 20% chance they try to shake down visitors for a toll of 1-10 gp per character.
	* If combat ensues, the denizens of the other guardroom (4-124) immediately emerge to aid their colleagues, and one guard sprints north to warn the rest of the cult.
	* If noise is heard at the north landing (4-119), 25% chance they come to investigate.
		* Could be due to the echo-effect of the bridge (4-120a), combat with chasm cephalopods, etc.
		* If they come, they will be suspicious.  Since the shield curtain (4-119) is porous from the north, they won’t be averse to hurling a few javelins through it.

### 4-126: Cultists’ Rest

* See description at 4-125.

### 4-127: Chasm View

* This ancient chamber overlooks the chasm of Set, currently used as a lounge for cultists.
	* The ceiling is covered with mother-of-pearl, making its three torches reflect wildly through the room.
	* The walls are freshly painted in light-blue wash, with gold stars and mystical symbols.
	* The floor is covered by a mosaic of a Set priest floating in the air between two cliffs.
	* 8 stools and 3 circular wooden tables; all battered and worn.
	* On the southeast wall are two iron levers and a hole for a third is next to them.
		* The levers have two positions (up and down; currently both down).
		* The third lever currently rest at the bottom of the chasm, see 4-121.  Any metal rod 1” in diameter and about 2’ long can be substituted. 
	* The southeastern corner of the chamber is open to the chasm (4-121)
		* A 3’-tall balustrade runs along the chasm edge.
			* Strangely, a 5’-wide section of the balustrade is missing.
			* The balustrade is 20’ above the landings at 4-119 and 4-120.
			* 20’ from the balustrade, a stone chest apparents to float in the air (actually resting on an invisible platform of stone), .
				* One might infer the balustrade opening is meant to lead (somehow) to the floating chest.
	* An invisible stone bridge connects the balustrade both to the chest platform and to the opposite side of the chasm.
		* It is 2’ below the lip of the balustrade; simply tapping where one imagines a bridge might be will not detect it.
		* Going out on the bridge automatically attracts the chasm cephalopods.
		* The invisible bridge is sturdy, if disconcerting, and leads at a slight angle across the chasm to the concealed door of the passage leading to 4-147a.
		* The chest rests on a slight widening of the bridge 12’ south of the balustrade.
			* The chest is locked and trapped with a gust of wind rune.
			* eight 2-lb platinum bars worth 500 gp each, a helm of underwater action, a pure white tear of Kauket (new) mounted in silver and wrapped in a piece of chamois-cloth.

The Levers (requires all 3 to produce any effect)
* down-down-down: ‘neutral’; no effects. 
* up-down-down: a magic mouth intones (Mithric), “Walk”
	* For 1-3 turns a high, keening sound emits from a the magic mouth; it deters chasm cephalopods, rendering the path to the chest safe.
* down-up-down: a magic mouth intones (Mithric), “The wind of Set eliminates those who do not belong!"
	* A gust of wind spell based at the foot of the stairs from 4-129, is directed towards the chasm.
* down-down-up: a magic mouth intones (Mithric), “The cleansing fire of Set removes the unbelievers!"
	* a moving wall of fire appears by the stairs leading from 4-129 and moves 5’ per round towards the balustrade.
* other four positions: a magic mouth intones (Mithric), “Unbelievers shall be slain!”
	* a cloudkill spell activates in the center of the chamber.

3-12 Set cultists (33%): SZ M; AL LE; AC 9; MV 90’; HD 1; HP 7, 7, 6(x4), 5(x3), 4, 4, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (dagger) or 2-7 (flail) or 1-6 (staff). Special attacks: fanaticism. Possessions: padded 
armor; daggers; flails or staves.

6 small chasm cephalopods (see new monsters), potentially drawn by manipulation of the levers: SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 2; HP 14, 13, 13, 12, 11, 8; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-3/1-3/1-4; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

### 4-128: Lesser Shrine

* High Priestess Stephania has set up a shrine here for the use of the cultists.
	* By the east wall are two 8’-tall painted statues of wood, cloth and papier-mâché.
		* One is of Set in his Set animal guise; the other is a white-faced, red-haired man.
		* Between the statues is a stone altar, stained with blood, on which is a copper bowl and a copper knife.
	* The walls are painted with human devotees bringing offerings to the statues.
	* The entire place radiates evil.
	* Near the south wall is a 5’-diameter hole in the floor covered with boards held down by chunks of rock.
		* The hole leads down 10’ before reaching the ceiling of the burial crypt (4-139a), with a drop of 20' to reach the floor.
* The cultists generally disdain this shrine, preferring to visit the ‘real thing’ further north.

2 Set acolytes (see new monsters), as 3rd-level Archontean clerics of Set: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 19, 18; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (mace) and 1-4 (light crossbow). Possessions: Set 
armor (see Arden Vul items); footman’s mace; light crossbow; acolyte’s was stick (see new magic items); and a silver holy symbol of Set (10 gp). Spells prayed for: command, cure light 
wounds, curse (reverse of bless), protection from good; hold person, silence 15’ radius.

2-8 Set cultists (see new monsters) (33% chance): SZ M; AL LE; AC 9; MV 90’; HD 1; HP 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (dagger) or 2-7 (flail) or 1-6 (staff). Special attacks: fanaticism. Possessions: padded armor; daggers; flails or staves.

### 4-129: Lounge

* This is a lounge area for cultists from the surrounding dormitories.
	* A wide fireplace vents to a cavern somewhere above.
		* The cultists are chronically short of firewood, so only 20% chance it is lit.
		* On a nail a foot up the interior of the chimney is a ring of water breathing (new) and a ring of warmth; they are blackened by smoke, but otherwise perfectly functional.
	* The chamber is austere, with several plank tables and benches, a water barrel, and only 6 comfortable-looking easy chairs, arranged in front of the fireplace.
* 50% chance one of the groups of cultists present in the dormitories will be here, talking, plotting, playing cards, and possibly torturing a slave or captive. 

### 4-130: Guard Post

* 2 Set guardsmen are posted to prevent inquisitive cultists venturing into the necropolis.
	* They lounge, bored, on a bench.
	* The locked door on the east wall is newly repaired. The guardsmen carry the key.

2 Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 2nd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 15, 12; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow). Special defense: fanaticism. Possessions: red scale mail and wooden shield; footman’s maces; spears; light crossbows with 20 bolts; key to the door on the east.

### 4-131: Cultists’ Rest

* See description at 4-125.

### 4-132: Cultists’ Rest

* See description at 4-125.

### 4-133: Cultists’ Rest

* See description at 4-125.

### 4-134: Larder

* This storeroom (locked) functions as the larder for the visiting cultists.
	* The main cult does not supply food, so groups of visitors bring their own, and deposit it here (quantities of boxes, bags, and bottles present depends on how many groups are currently visiting).
	* Supplies possibly present: skins of water and wine, packages of hard-tack, dried meat, dried fruit, even some fresh vegetables (worth their weight in gold!).
* There is a 25% chance that Jasper is asleep here on a simple pallet.

(25%) Jasper Roe, male Thorcin cook: for stats, see 4-135.
* Storeroom key.

### 4-135: Kitchen and Lounge

* This large room functions as a kitchen, dining area and lounge for cultists visiting the temple and Forum of Set.
	* A larger-than-normal tripod of heating (new) stands in the southwest corner.
	* The cook, Jasper Roe, has a small but effective array of cooking pots and utensils, as well as a preparation table along the south wall.
	* North of the fire is a pair of long trestle tables.
	* North and east of the room are comfortable stuffed chairs and low tables.
		* Scattered around them are a few religious pamphlets on parchment scrolls.
* Jasper is present 75% of the time, preparing food for the cultists.
* 50% chance a group of Set cultists are here, eating or hanging around.

Jasper Roe, male Thorcin cook (75%): SZ M; AL LE; AC 9; MV 120’; HD 1-1; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (cleaver). Possessions: cleaver and key to 4-134.

6-9 Set cultists (see new monsters) (50% chance): SZ M; AL LE; AC 9; MV 90’; HD 1; HP 7, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (dagger) or 2-7 (flail) or 1-6 (staff). Special attacks: fanaticism. Possessions: padded armor; daggers; flails or staves.

## Level 4: 136 - 146: Necropolis of Set

* These areas comprise the ancient necropolis of the cult of Set.
	* The areas were lost due to the collapse in antiquity of certain key tunnels (e.g., 4-137) until High Priestess Stephania ordered the stairs and tunnels cleared to allow the restoration of the necropolis.
	* Unfortunately, the priests found the necropolis was highly dangerous, inhabited by numerous undead under the domination of Meskenit the mummy (4-139c).
		* The entire area is so flooded with negative energy that turning undead is impossible.
		* Stephania tried to lure the intelligent undead out of their necropolis, but they know she intends to dominate them and did not fall for her ruse.
			* Stephania is unaware of the powers of the golden ankh in 4-138a, which would allow her to dominate the undead in the necropolis area.
	* The entire area is covered with dust and cobwebs, and the stonework is crumbling in numerous locations.  Unless otherwise indicated, the chambers are dark.

### 4-136: Dead Bodies!

* This chamber marks the limit of the modern Set cult’s expansion into the necropolis area.
	* The cult cleared it of debris, revealing some faded but still impressive murals on the south and west walls depicting the judgment of the dead.
		* From the southeast corner: a parade of dead souls; Anubis with the ankh of life leading an old-style Archontean man past several monstrous beings; the deceased confessing the status of his soul, with the phrase “I am strong, but Set is stronger” repeated numerous times in a Mithric word-cloud above his head; Maat weighing the heart against her feather; and Set recording the name of the deceased in a huge red scroll.
			* Experts in Mithric theology will note two deviations from the usual iconography of the judgment of the Dead: 1) normally the confession is “I am pure”, not “I am strong” with the addition of “but Set is stronger,” 2) normally Thoth is the recorder of the names of the dead, not Set. 
	* Numerous excavation tools lie about (picks, mauls, shovels, heavy canvas bags for toting rock, carrying straps, etc) and the gnawed corpses of eight workers slain by the undead from within the necropolis.
		* One turn after the chamber is entered, the eight corpses rise as strong zombies to smite intruders.
	* The tunnel to the east has been recently excavated; its walls are still rough, and the floor littered with rock dust and loose debris.
		* The ceiling is obviously unstable, propped up with sturdy wooden beams.

8 strong zombies: SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 22, 20, 19, 19, 18, 18, 17, 16; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special: always strike last.

### 4-137: Trapped Hallway

* Stairs at the north and south ends of this crumbling hallway lead down into the main areas of the necropolis.
	* The granite stairs are carved in a deliberately rough way, with steep risers, emphasizing the primal nature of death.
	* Two traps are located at the landing leading to 4-136:
		* Glyph of warding: placed by Stephania to fend off the lesser undead, it explodes for 20 HP fire damage. 
		* Unstable ceiling: significant noise (such as the glyph exploding) may (75%) cause a serious cave-in (those within 25’ save or take 3d8 damage).
			* Moderate noise, such as combat on the landing, has a 33% chance per turn of causing the collapse.

### 4-138: Eastern Crypt

* The ceiling of this huge chamber rises 20’ above the floor of the entrance hallway.
	* The crypt is completely lightless and as quiet as a tomb.
	* Two T-shaped platforms occupy either end of the crypt (4-138a and 4-13c), joined by an 80’ sunken walkway (15' below the platforms) lined with burial niches (4-138b).
		* Each platform holds 20 large stone sarcophagi carved in ornate, ancient style.
		* A 15’-tall statue of Set (as Set animal-headed) stands on western platform facing the entrance to the crypt.
		* The walls of the platforms were once painted with bright images of Set, the judgment of the dead, and the defeat of various enemies; mostly faded or flaked off now, with only some fragments visible.
* A band of corporeal undead dominated by the greater mum-my, Meskenit (see 4-139c), inhabit the crypt.
	* These stealthily approach any intruders within 2-6 rounds of the crypt being entered and attempt either to overwhelm the intruders or to drive them towards their master in 4-139c.

##### 4-138a: Entry Platform and Statue of Set

* The entry platform holds 20 sealed sarcophagi (for potential contents see 4-138c) and an imposing statue of Set in the form of the Set animal.
	* The statue of Set is black obsidian with a white marble head, ears and snout of solid gold, and lapis eyes (the head is worth 4,575 gp, 340 lb).
	* He holds a 24”-long golden ankh (new) in one hand and a 3’-long silver flail with many heads in the other (the sterling flail of Set, new).
	* On the right calf of the statue, about 3’ from the floor, are two flattened patches of obsidian (spot as secret door, unless specifically examining the whole statue).
		* The upper patch has four 1” squares, each with a different rune carved in it
		* The lower one features four empty 1” squares arranged in a cruciform style.
	* The statue can be manipulated in various ways to produce effects, and it may activate in response to actions.

The following actions might awaken Set Statue:
1. Opening any sealed sarcophagi: the statue activates as a stone golem to smite desecrators using its ankh, flail, and magical powers. It pursues intruders within the crypt, but will not leave it.
2. Supplicating Set by stating, “I am strong, but Set is stronger” (c.f. 4-136): this awakens the Set golem; its eyes shift from blue to a menacing, glowing red.  The golem intervenes against any who assault the supplicants, including undead.
3. Breaking open the burial niches: 5% cumultive chance per niche that the Set golem activates to smite the intruders.
4. Attempting to steal the silver flail: see below for when/if this might awaken the golem.

Manipulating the statue may also produce effects:
1. Removing the gold snout or ears, or the lapis eyes: blasts of blue energy unerringly strike the desecrator for 6d6 damage (save vs spells for half).
2. Removing the golden ankh: the golden ankh (new) can be removed.
	* It can be picked up by those of any alignment, but only serves those who are neutral or evil; it acts as a cursed object for those of good alignment.
	* Within the necropolis of Set, wielded by a neutral or evil character, the ankh turns undead as if it were a 12th-level cleric.
	* For other powers of the ankh, see new magic items. 
3. Removing the silver flail: the flail (new) can only be safely removed by a non-good handler who specifically invokes Set by name and (briefly) explains his need.  Otherwise the statue animates and attacks.
4. Manipulating the runes and empty squares: together they form a puzzle
	* Touching a rune and then an empty square causes that rune to appear in the square in tiny, fiery script.  Touching a square again clears it.
	* The runes are: ankh (protection); djed column (strength/body); was stick (power); and lotus (creation).
	* The four squares are in a diamond pattern (1 through 4, clockwise from the top).
	* Each effect can only be produced 1x/week, and certain effects (e.g. ankh-ankh-ankh-djed) are only possible once per person.

* Ankh Ankh Ankh Ankh
	* Antimagic shell around manipulator of runes, lasts 3-6 weeks. No magic in or out. Manipulator’s body glows with magical yellow light, visible 60’ away.
* Ankh Ankh Ankh Djed

	* Body overloads. An extremity withers and becomes useless [1=left hand, 2=right hand, 3=left arm, 4=right arm, 5=left leg, 6=left foot, 7=right leg, 8=right foot].
* Was Was Was Lotus
	* Manipulator must discharge ray of power (2-8 damage) every hour for the next 1-4 days. If no enemies, friends or self are/is affected.
* Lotus Ankh Ankh Lotus
	* Protection from undead cast on manipulator. Lasts 2-5 days; AC +2 vs undead; undead do -2 damage; saves are at +2 versus undead effects.
* Lotus Ankh Ankh Djed
	* The following spells are cast on all within 10’ radius: heal, neutralize poison, cure disease.
* Was Was Was Was
	* Magical short-circuit, 2-5 magic items closest to statue are drained of power. Save at -2 to avoid.
* Lotus Lotus Lotus Lotus

### 4-139: Southern Crypt 

* This immense chamber is broadly similar to its companion at 4-138.
	* Its ceiling rises 20’ above the floor.
	* Two T-shaped platforms occupy either end of the crypt (4-139a and 4-139c) joined by an 80’-long sunken walkway lined with burial niches (4-139b).
		* The walkway is 15’ below the floor of the two platforms.
		* Each platform holds 20 large stone sarcophagi carved in ornate, ancient style.
		* A large statue of Set once stood on the platform of 4-139Aa but now lies in pieces among the sarcophagi.
		* The walls of the platforms are painted with bright images of Set, the Judgment of the Dead, and the defeat of various enemies.
* Meskenit the greater mummy rules the necropolis area from this crypt.
	* He is often found at 4-139c, accompanied by a lesser mummy and a pack of ghasts; if not there, he will be in 4-146.

##### 4-139a: Front Platform and Statue of Set

* The entry platform features 20 sarcophagi and the ruined statue of Set.
	* The obsidian statue of Set lies in pieces; only the feet remain on the pedestal.
		* Trap (glyph of warding): Meskenit placed a glyph (18 fire damage) on top of the ruined pedestal of the statue.
	* Set’s white marble head, complete with gold snout and ears and lapis eyes, has rolled behind one of the sarcophagi (4,575 gp, 340 lbs).
		* If approached, the lapis eyes pulse with a sinister blue light, but in its ruined state Set cannot act through this golem any longer.
		* Set used to carry a 24” golden ankh and a 3’ golden scepter, but Meskenit has stolen these objects (see 4-146). 
	* These sarcophagi are ancient and elaborately carved, with half-round carvings of Set, dungeon exploration, monster slaughter, and crueler themes.
		* The sarcophagi vary in height, length and width (averaging 6’ long, 3’ wide, and 4’ high), and are all closed and sealed.
			* Breaking a seal requires 1d4 rounds and a total 36 strength.
			* For the contents of any sarcophagus, see tables at 4-138c.
* Initially, there are no opponents here.  Meskenit and his minions prefer to rest at 4-139c (see tactics therein).

##### 4-139b: Walkway and Burial Niches

* Each 10’ section of wall along the walkway between the platforms contains 9 burial niches.
	* Thus 252 niches per wall, 504 niches in total.
	* The plugs of fifteen of the niches have burst open from within.
	* The remainder are sealed, and contain skeletal remains plus 1-2 objects from the relevant table located at 4-138b.
* Halfway down the walkway between the platforms, Meskenit placed a glyph of warding (paralysis).

##### 4-139c: Rear Platform and Sarcophagi

* The rear platform holds 20 more sarcophagi (on average 6’ long, 3’ wide, and 4’ high).
	* They are ancient and elaborately carved with themes of Set, dungeon exploration, monster slaughter, and crueler themes.
	* Three sarcophagi on this platform have been opened.
		* Their contents are available (see tables in 4-138c).
	* Breaking a sarcophagus seal requires 1d4 rounds and a total 36 strength.
	* For the contents of any sarcophagus, see tables at 4-138c.
* Meskenit is usually present here, accompanied by his lesser mummy and pack of ghasts.
	* They wait quietly, hoping that the glyphs at 4-139a and 4-139b will weaken and immobilize invading PCs.
		* When the second trap has been tripped (or negated), Meskenit releases the pack of ghasts and orders his lieutenant into the fray.
		* He remains on the platform, casting spells, all the while intoning vile charms and curses in a dry, raspy, high-pitched voice.

Meskenit, a greater mummy (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 0; MV 90’; HD 10+3; HP 73; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12; MR 50%. Special attacks: aura of despair (saves at -3); mummy rot; command other undead.

### 4-140: Storage Room

* This low-ceilinged room (8’ tall) and was a general storage room for the necropolis.
	* The walls are undecorated and roughly hewn.
	* Three heavy sarcophagus bottoms (no lids) line the center of the room.
		* One has partial half-round carvings; the others are still rough.
	* A stone bench is set against the south wall, on which are numerous stone carving tools, some jars of spices (2-200 gp) and (dried) unguents, and a large bundle of linen wrappings.
	* Secret Door (north, into narrow hallway): narrow and small (5’x5’), easy (1 in 4) to locate.  Opened by force or by rapping on it three times in rapid succession.
	* Secret Door (north, to 4-149): small (5’x5’). Opened by pressing a dime-sized button inset on one of the stair risers.
	* Secret Door (south, to 4-141): quite wide (8’) and short (4’ tall), hard to detect (1 in 8). Opened by sliding a thin knife into the bottom seam to release a catch, after which the bottom may be pushed inward.
* Noise and time spent here likely attracts the ghouls and wight from 4-138c.

### 4-141: Lost Altar

* A rough stone altar rests against the south wall, coated in dried blood and strongly radiating evil.
	* It is an illusion concealing the secret door behind it.
		* If believed, the viewer feels that a great evil lurks here, or the arrival of demonic evil is imminent, and retreat is the best action.
		* If disbelieved, the secret door is readily apparent on the south wall.
* Secret Door (south): 2’ wide and 5’ tall.  Difficult to locate unless the illusion is overcome, then normal.  Pressing a stud near the floor activates the door, which snaps inward on spring-loaded hinges.

### 4-142: Tomb of Theskelon the High Priest

* This ancient tomb holds the remains of Theskelon, the high priest of Set responsible for the creation of the necropolis.
	* The current Set priests are ignorant of the existence of this tomb.
	* Discovery of Theskelon’s tomb would be of signal importance to the modern cult.
		* Those who report it to Stephania receive 500 gp each.
		* Looting the tomb provokes the cult's eternal enmity, should it become known.

* Theskelon’s tomb is decorated with a stark white plaster, on which are painted a number of unusual frescoes (intact, if a little faded).
	* The collage-like images are impressive, yet simultaneously amateurish; they are also fairly chilling, since all four connote violence and savagery. 
		* 1) an enormous black boar with an 11” yellow sun clamped in its hairy jaws.
			* Some sort of lumpy substance has been used to outline the boar’s body and provide relief to the otherwise flat wall.
			* The boar’s one visible eye is a hole in the fresco, it's back painted red, but without a pupil.
			* Actual bristles and bits of horn were implanted in the plaster.
			* The ‘sun’ is an 11" sphere whose outer layer of painted plaster conceals a 10” solid gold center (400 gp).
		* 2) a crocodile devouring a heron
			* Realistic teeth are implanted into the bas-relief, and the heron-legs are made of femurs of some huge mammal.
		* 3) a huge Set animal squatting on a turtle
			* The eyes of the Set animal are 2”-diameter black crystals; the turtle’s shell is made out of an enormous turtle shell.
		* 4) a tall human figure dressed as a priest of Set with a garish, grinning white face splitting a huge baboon in half with an axe.
			* The features are particularly accentuated: the human’s head is bulbous, lumpy and features real black hair, the axe head is an actual axe head; the relief of the baboon is covered by bits of matted real fur.
	* In the middle of the chamber is the unusual ‘sarcophagus’ of Theskelon.
		* It is a single unbroken block of mottled green granite, 4’ wide, 8’ long, and 6’ tall, obviously not native to the surrounding stone.
		* Inspection reveals no anomalies, fissures, or cracks.
		* A continuous inscription at a height of 4’ reads (Mithric) “Theskelon is in me. I am in Theskelon”
		* There is a spherical depression on the top of the block, 10” in diameter.
			* Incised around this depression in tiny letters “Let Set devour the rays of his old rival.”
			* If the gold sun is removed from the wall and placed in this depression, it melts and the granite block crumbles to dust and debris (2d10 under DEX to avoid 1d4 from flying shards), revealing the inner sarcophagus.
				* A gleaming gold and lapis sarcophagus (600 gp worth of materials), sculpted as a recumbent man with crossed arms, dressed in ceremonial Set robes.
					* It is trapped with explosive runes.

Obtaining the Orb
* It's not obvious there is something below the plaster.
* The plaster around the orb is rock hard.  Smashing it free has a 50% chance of deforming the orb into uselessness.
* Inserting the missing ruby (not glass) eye into the boar causes the plaster to crumble, releasing the orb.

Obtaining the Eye
* The clue to the location of the missing eye is a pun in the inscription on the sarcophagus.
	* “I am in Theskelon”: the missing ‘eye’ is buried inside the plaster bas-relief of the Theskelon image (i.e., “I” or Theskelon).
	* Digging around in the image’s bulbous head rewards two red gems, each 2” in diameter: a ruby eye (the real eye, 1000 gp) and a piece of glass.

Inside the Sacrophagus
* The inert bones of Theskelon
* Several important artifacts of the ancient cult of Set.
	* Not magical or inherently valuable; they hold clues to exploration of the dungeon ruins. To the current cult of Set, as symbolic and historical artifacts they are priceless.
		* Signet Ring of Theskelon
			* A gold ring (50 gp) with carved image of a male head and the legend “Theskelon the Master.”
			* As a symbol of legitimacy within the priesthood of Set, this ring would be of incalculable value to High Priestess Stephania.
			* Note: this is not a true ring of Set, as it predates them.
		* Plaques of the Beacon
			* Three copper plaques 10” wide by 14” tall hold incised schematic drawings of three of the modules from the Beacon.
			* One side of each plaque shows the complete floorplan of the given module (both levels, if the module has two levels), along with one or two Rudishva glyphs. The reverse side has some instructions in Mithric.
				* The first plaque depicts the engine room of the Beacon (7-143). The glyphs are for ‘power’ and ‘flight’.  The notes read “Unknown location. Possibly near the administrative center and shrines. Likely a powerful weapon.”
				* The second plaque depicts the crew quarters (6-112), with the glyphs ‘dwelling’ and ‘peaceful’; the notes read “the Scriptor claims to know its location, as his workmen found it. But the workmen were devoured and the Scriptor is not talking.”
					* GM: refers to Lucius Cornelius Scriptor and the construction of his tomb (6-130 to 6-135) at a location near to the crew pod.
				* The third plaque depicts the weapons locker (6-27) and uses the glyphs ‘armory’ and ‘mechanical voice’; the notes read “Unknown location. Reference to a voice is undoubtedly a mistake.”
					* GM: the voice refers to the AI, RAJ-750 (6-27).
		* The Rise of the Sortians
			* An unusual set of bone plates containing text (secret tongue of the priests of Set) (books).
		* The Theskelonia
			* A parchment codex with black hide covers (books).
		* An ivory plaque with the last third of the treatise Preparing for the Long Death (books, 3000 gp).
			* Contains the new spell, the long death, and some necromantic theory.
			* The other two plaques are in the possession of Meskenit (4-146).
		* A key that fits the lock in the stone door at SL8-1.

### 4-143: Slaver’s Rest

* A former necropolis antechamber cut off from the rest of the area by ancient cave-ins.
	* Used as a way station by the Guild of Service when traveling the Long Stair (4-19).
		* A couple of benches, a water barrel, a set of broken shackles, and a coiled whip are scattered about the floor.
		* 4 guildsmen from the Guild of Service stand guard here, ensuring nothing dangerous emerges from 4-154.  A brass horn hangs from the wall, used to  alert those in 4-19 of any threat.
	* The door to the west is stuck.
		* It leads to stairs that once connected to 4-145, but that now end in a cave-in.
			* Harold the Wary, a lost adventurer, is cowering in the broken hallway behind the stuck door.
				* He took refuge here during a change in the guard rotation, and is increasingly desperate to make his way past the guards.

* Harold is a big man, but a bit of a coward (‘wary’, as he calls it).
	* He was part of the gang led by Gillen the magic user (see 4-180), but deserted when Gillen revealed his intention to set up operations as a bandit.
	* He fled north and east, and barely managing to avoid capture by the slavers. 
	* He could retrace his footsteps to 4-179 and would happily warn new comrades of the threat posed by Gillen and Co. if those new comrades promised to help him escape the Halls.
	* He has never visited the Forum (4-2).
	* Unless convinced that he does possess courage by some friendly, good-aligned persons, Harold like to quaffs his potion and disappears at the first sign of danger.

Harold the Wary, 3rd-level male Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 22; #AT 1; Dmg 3-8 (footman’s mace) or 1-4 (crossbow bolt). Abilities: STR 16, INT 15, WIS 9, 
DEX 10, CON 13, CHA 15. Possessions: scale mail and shield; footman’s mace; a light crossbow with 12 bolts; a pouch of marbles; a purse with 39 sp; and a potion of invisibility.

4 guildsmen, as 2nd-level male Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 18, 17, 16, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (spears, clubs). Possessions: leather armor; spears; and clubs. Special: they have +1 to damage from STR.

### 4-144: Guardian Noses

* This chamber offers another resting point for those traveling the Long Stair (4-19).
	* The east and west walls are painted with identical enchanted frescoes of an enormous, bulbous human or humanoid nose, complete with pores and follicles.
	* They ‘smell’ (detect) alignment, and bray loudly if they sense a non-evil alignment.
		* This provokes an immediate random encounter roll (the encounter won't be surprised thanks to the noice).
	* Two gallons of liquid and some cloth can easily remove the frescoes.

### 4-145: Broken Corridor

* This long corridor extending east from 4-148 (under 4-145 and 4-139b) is filled with dust and cobwebs.
	* At the east end, motion has a 25% chance / Turn to cause a cave-in affecting the final 40’ of the corridor (3d8 under DEX or 4d6 damage).

### 4-146: Lair of the Mummy Lord

* Meskenit the greater mummy (4-139c) has made this undecorated chamber his war room, to plot vengeance against the living and to run experiments in mummy creation.
	* This chamber was a preparation room for the necropolis, and is filled with appropriate gear: hammers and chisels, a wooden work table with jars of unguents and preserving spices, two boxes filled with wrapping linen, a dozen sheets of thinly hammered gold leaf (12 gp each), and a clay pot filled with bits of odd-sized lapis (a total of 230 gp).
	* In an iron box on the worktable are a pair of ivory plaques inscribed with an ancient treatise entitled “Preparing for the Long Death.” (books) (creation of mummies)
		* The first plaque describes the materials needed for mummification; the second plaque has the process and initial spells needed to accomplish this rite.
		* Meskenit doesn’t know that he is missing a third plaque (see 4-142), which explains his frustrating results to date.

			* It beats and scratches at the lid if it detects good creatures in the chamber. 
			* The corpse which Meskenit used to create his mummy was that of the lawful good priest Icthelon.  Thoth ensured that the product remains sentient and good.

### 4-148: Hidden Mortuary Temple

* Knowledge of this mortuary temple has been lost to the Set Cult for over 1,200 years.
	* Originally it served as a lesser temple, where the remains of donors could be prepared and those donors’ service to Set celebrated.
* A raised walkway overlooks the main temple.

	* Frescoes decorate the north, west, and eat walls.

	* Four slim black pillars rise to a barrel-vaulted ceiling.
		* A cluster of five human-sized shapes is huddled around a 3’-tall cylinder within the area circumscribed by the four pillars.
			* The cylinder radiates good, it is a salt lamp of protection (greater) (new).
			* The shapes are remains of an adventuring team.  When ambushed by shadows, they used the lamp to drive off the creatures.  Lacking fuel, the party mage desperately used her own life force to power it.  When she grew exhausted, the lamp failed, and the shadows massacred the party.
				* Only a small residue of red ‘wax’ remains in the lamp.
			* On the adventurers:
				* suits of banded mail, chain mail, splint mail and leather armor +2; a broadsword, footman’s flail, a short bow, and 3 daggers; 78 gp, 120 sp, a 130 gp gem, a 90 gp gem, an oriental carpet showing the 3rd mystery of Set (375 gp), 2 vials of acid, a short sword +1, 10 arrows +2, a wand of magic missiles (1 charge), a cursed wand of life-stealing (27 charges) (new), potions (fire resistance, animal control), a ring of higher purpose (new), a lesser power supply (empty).

	* Four torches light the area.
	* To the east, by the door, is a large barrel of torches and pitch.
	* On the western side of the square, by the caved-in corridor, the slavers have erected two frames on which they display the bloodied bodies of troublesome slaves.

	* Neither has any equipment.
	* The ranger is in bad shape, the slavers amputated his hands and is unlikely to last much longer.
		* He stoically whispers a few words of advice about the complex to any who aid him in his final agonies.
	* Hjalti the Wiskin is in better shape; though badly burned and branded (down to 6 HP), he could be revived.
		* He was taken by the Guild of Service while exploring the southern great cavern (3-172) as part of a failed adventuring expedition.
		* Hjalti knew that the (now-dead) party leader wished to locate a certain ‘evil sorcerer’ named Kerbog Khan (SL12-25), who was ‘wanted by all the collegia, and especially the Collegium of Macrina,’ for theft of valuable treatises, codices, and alchemical materials.
		* They also had rumors of a 'lord of the fungi', and were searching the fungal forest to locate them (Note: he means the false-Ptarmis at 3-176).
		* Hjalti was in the slave pits (4-11), but was punished for trying to lead an escape.
		* He happily offer directions to those who aid him, and could navigate the route from 4-149 to 4-163, 4-160, 4-159, 3-212A, 3-172 and eventually to the cliff exit at 3-189.

	* 20' below the ledge, a layer of bones covers the floor.
		* The layer is extremely deep; the floor of the cavern is 75’ below the ledge.
			* The ancient cult of Set tossed unwanted corpses here, including of lesser believers (who usually imagined a more noble burial in the necropolis).
			* Recently, the Guild of Service began disposing of casualties here, so the bodies closest to the ledge are fresh (some not yet skeletonized).
		* Those foolishly pawing around in the remains may catch a disease from filth and tiny vermin devouring the flesh of corpses (25% + 5% per turn).
	* An exit leading to 4-53 exists to the southwest, 50’ below the entry ledge and 25’ above the floor.

##### 4-151a: Pukel-Mander

* On another ledge 75’ above the floor of the pit of bones stands a loathsome pukel-mander (new).

	* Scrawled on the wall (secret tongue of Set): “Danger! None have returned.”
	* Stepping through the one-way veil brings the foolish to the 497th layer of abyss, ruled by Kauket.

Stone shaped closed
### 4-153: Arcanum Cave

* This cave is a natural geode of arcanum (new).
	* The walls, floor and ceiling of the cave pulsate with a sickly orange light.

### 4-155: Forgotten God

* Buckled blue-granite pavers line this shrine to a forgotten god.
	* The chamber is wreathed in heavy ropes of cobwebs.  Any decorations have long since faded.
	* The walls are the same grey-blue granite, with many of the sheathing slabs fallen, leaving the bare stone beneath.
	* Four heavy pillars of green granite rise to a flat ceiling 30’ above the pavement.
		* The pillar segments were carved with elaborate geometric and representational schemes, but the passage of time has worn most of the images smooth.
			* One might see a glimpse of a cylindrical entity with four legs, or some bipeds that look like insects (mantises); a few random humans are shown, though their dress and depiction is foreign and puzzling.
	* The paving stones are treacherous, and liable to collapse.
		* Walking carefully is safe, though the pavers roll and tilt underfoot.
		* Running or fighting has a 1 in 6 chance per person per 10’ square crossed (or fought on) of collapse (50% fall prone, 50% fall into a 10' hole for 1d6).
	* A colossal nataraja statue stands in front of the opening to 4-156, at the east end.
		* Buried under the paver directly in front of the statue is a box of grey plasteel.
			* Locked (-25% to pick) and trapped with electronic intruder repulsors.
				* The trap can be detected normally and disarmed normally.
					* Even successful disarming shocks for 2d6.
					* Disarming does ensure the damage isn't repeated, allowing picking (otherwise 2d6 shock per round touching the lockplate).

		* The head has the horns and smiling fanged mouth of a rudishva, face snarling with glaring eyes.
			* Inobviously, the statue’s four fangs are solid platinum (200 gp each).
			* Its features are cloaked in dust and cobwebs, and hard to make out.  If cleaned up, the statue has crisp, clean features in unlike the decrepitude of the rest of the shrine. 
			* Scraping away dust also reveals a niche in the statue’s chest, with a faintly glowing, fist-sized piece of orange arcanum (see new magic items) inside. 
				* If touched, the statue booms in several unknown languages, then Archontean, “Do not touch the heart of the God. This is your final warning.” 
				* If removed, it shouts in several languages, then Archontean “The Six shall be notified that the Uthric has been disrupted. Punishment commences!.”
					* Two type II demons gate in and attack the desecrators.
					* The statue begin casting (in order): slow, darkness 15’ radius, and cloudkill.
					* Behind the lump, within the chest niche, is a silver scroll case (scroll w/ glasseye, legend lore, and repulsion).

6 / 15
### 4-157: Carved Chamber

* Every inch of the walls and ceiling of this rounded chamber has been carved with 1”-deep geometric and representational figures.
	* The figures are hard to make out, bodies elongated and twisted, but the following are clear: thin-limbed bipeds (rudishva), bird-men (varuda), long- and heavy-limbed bipeds (varumani), and snake-men (kaliyani).
		* The faces have all been systematically obliterated with destructive magic, and three sections of carving that carried inscriptions have been utterly obliterated.
	* A 5’-square chunk of the east wall has been completely removed.
* The passage north ends in a cave-in.  A tiny, cramped tunnel continues wending upward, ending at one of the cells in the prison of Set (3-105d).
* Secret Door (south): opened by pushing a 3”-tall image of a door on the section of the western wall of 4-157 closest to the entrance.
* The chamber was built by the rudishva to tell the story of the Beacon and its inhabitants.
	* The priest of Thoth who discovered the chamber destroyed the wall images but carted off a section featuring an enormous image of the Beacon (see 4-158).
* The chamber is peaceful, quiet and secure, and would make a good refuge.

### 4-158: Secret Chamber

* The chamber has the same carved walls and rounded corners as 4-157.
	* A dangerous invisible field of magical energy bisects the chamber at a point 8’ from the southern wall.
		* After several millennia, however, the trap is malfunctioning.
			* Every 3d6 rounds it shimmers briefly into visibility.
			* A non-rudishva organism touching or crossing is zapped (6d6, save vs breath weapons for 3/4 damage).  Only 1d6 discharges left before it fails.
	* The northern secret door can only be opened as described in 4-157.
	* A chest of gray plasteel lies against the south wall.
		* The chest is empty, robbed in antiquity by whoever dug the tunnel to the east.
		* The chest holds the projector module for the field (2 zaps left).
	* Lying in the center of the room is a desiccated corpse in the orange robes of a Thothian priest, charred by energy or electricity.
		* 15 ancient silver pennies, key to the left hematite door (3-177), and an eye of seeing (new).
		* Floating next to the body is a 5’ x 5’ x 1’ segment of stone (4200 lbs) covered with strange carvings (the piece taken from the wall in 4-157). 
			* The slab rests on a permanent enhanced floating disk of the priest’s devising (responds to command words (Mithric): “Go!”, “Stop!”, etc. 
			* The slab (1000-4000 gp to a Collegia or imperial scholars) depicts a strange dwelling shaped like a flattened sphere, standing on six piers, with numerous ‘antennae’ protruding from it. A ramp descends form the body of the dwelling to the ground, and numerous representatives of the four races depicted in 4-157 are shown on the ramp. Beneath the carving is the phrase, in Rudishva glyphis, “Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven.”

### 4-159: Stairs Up to 3-212a

* These stairs climb to 3-212a.
	* They are used by the cult of Set to visit the upper levels of the dungeon.
	* A bright yellow arrow floats a foot above the ground, pointing up the stairs.
* Secret Door (north): hard to locate (1 in 8), opens by sliding an extremely thin pin (pick, etc; 1/8” thick) along the crack between the door and the floor.
	* It leads via a dusty staircase and natural tunnel to 4-158.

### 4-160: Crossroads

* An important crossroads for moving about the middle levels of the dungeon.
	* Relatively clear of debris and dust.
	* Each time the party enters, roll on the following table:
		* If the party comes from the west (4-163), any encounter here is warned of their approach by the booming of the magic mouth, won't be surprised, and has  an additional chance to surprise (3-in-6).

### 4-162: Hall of the Set Animals, w/ access to SL8-19

* This 15’-tall octagonal hall has a pretty vaulted ceiling, and much faded, but still visible artwork whose effect is busy, garish, and slightly chaotic.
	* South wall: a huge (10’ x 15’) fresco of a Set animal’s head.
	* Other walls: Set animals in various poses – standing, jumping, attacking, climbing walls, climbing trees, etc.

### 4-163: Many Stairs and Loud Voice

* Three important staircases meet at this landing.
* A magic mouth by the eastern stairs, speaks if movement occurs within 10’.

	* The mouth resets after one hour, ready to echo again. 

### 4-164: Hall of the Worthies

* The door to this chamber is stuck in a partly open position.
* Within is an impressive hall 30’ tall and adorned with ancient veined-marble pavers and sheathing.
	* Three hemispherical marble plinths (5’ high) line each of the east and west walls, each (except A) is occupied by a statue.
		* Each is a statue of one of the Twenty Worthies of the Archontean Empire, their name incised across its plinth.
	*  A 3’-wide and 8’-deep basin, filled with a murky, sludgy liquid, runs the length of the room between two rows of three rectangular granite platforms (3’ tall), one in front of each plinth.
	* The south wall has been damaged by some tunneling creature, with a 3’ hole broken through 15’ off the ground.
	* A massive mosaic spans the entire south wall.
		* In the center, in 5’-tall script (Mithric) “Let the Worthy Illuminate the [gap].”
			* The gap where they tunnel emerges contained the word “Unworthy” (may find the fragments in the rubble below the hole.
		* Below the inscription is an image of a robed human standing on a platform looking at a statue of a warrior.
		* To the sides of the inscription are colossal images (same socialist-realist mode of the colossi on the cliff face) of Arden and Vul, the former leaning on her spear while gazing impassively at the inscription, and the latter, face obscured by hood, pointing to the inscription with a wand.

The Statues
* In ancient days these legendary heroes were archetypes of behavior and profession, and might still be familiar to more bookish PCs.
* A statue's magic is activated when a person stands on a platform, faced the appropriate worthy, and declaims “Let the Worthy Illuminate the Unworthy.”
	* A bit more dangerous in the present day, due to magical decay.
		* If the phrase is mangled or not spoken within a minute, a negative effect is produced from the basin behind the postulant.
		* In a few cases, the magic is malfunctioning.
	* The magic of each statue will only work once per person.

* A. Priscus Pulcher, the Arch-Sortian
	* The name has been badly damaged, but is still just legible
	* Statue: completely missing.  A wreath of fragrant and fresh flowers rests on the plinth (replaced every 2-8 days).
		* A Priscian mage?
	* Magical Effect: none
	* Negative Effect: none

* B. Licinia the Seer
	* Statue: a heavy-set woman in a toga with arms at her side. Her eyes are exaggeratedly large and empty.
	* Magical Effect: Licinia represents power over/in the future. She intones the following phrase in affectless Mithric: ‘Our eyes see deeds that are yet to be; to unlock those sights ask thy questions three.’ The postulant can then ask up to three questions about the future. 
		* The GM should provide truthful answers, although he/she will have to be more speculative about contingent events.
	* Negative Effect: the liquid in the basin turns slightly gelatinous and rises as a tentacle from the basin. The postulant on the platform is struck by the liquid (no save) and is cursed such that he/she will be -2 to all die rolls for the next month. This curse will not be immediately evident, of course.

* C. Thrygga the Mighty
	* Statue: a warrior clad in ancient imperial field plate, with two hands clutching a massive claymore.
		* The statue’s head is missing; a fountain of colored sparks spews continuously from its truncated neck.
			* The sparks rain down in a 5’ radius (they burn for 3d4 and produce a lasting, and brightly colored, scar, on the hand/arm (50%) or face (50%).
	* Magical Effect: the positive effect is malfunctioning, and anyone who steps on the platform - regardless of what he/she utters - will activate the negative effect.
	* Negative Effect: the liquid in the basin boils and, after 3 rounds, a cloudkill spell is activated. It takes 2 rounds to fill the chamber.

* D. Plotinus Quartus Claudino, Archon
	* Statue: a dignified man, dressed in a toga and wearing an olive wreath. A set of fasces is cradled in one arm, other is raised in greeting (three fingers, palm outward). 
	* Magical Effect: Plotinus represents power in the present. He responds in the measured tones of a practiced orator: My writ runs over all that I now see; for knowledge of the same ask thy questions three. Plotinus answers questions about current events, individuals, and locations; he does so elliptically, but at some length.
	* Negative Effect: the liquid in the basin roils and bubbles; after 1 round an exact duplicates of all visitors clamber forth and confront the originals. These duplicates have the same statistics and equipment as the PCs, if defeated they melt into sludgy liquid. The duplicates cannot cast spells, but are able to mimic magic items.

* E. Yeth, Who Sought to Bring Law to Chaos
	* Statue: a gnarled, bent man dressed in rags, with wild, unkempt hair. He carries no objects, and his arms are splayed in a wild manner. His eyes bug wildly.
	* Magical Effect: Yeth represents chaos and randomness. He wildly screeches a series of unrhymed nonsense: Blue rills of ethereal bone drip upward to the globular leaves of prophecy!
		* Roll 1d20-2 on the chart below.
	* Negative Effect: the liquid in the basin roils for a round and then explodes in a wet, gooey mess over the room. Roll 1d20+2 on the chart below.

Modified d20 Effect
* -1 to 0 One random attribute is permanently raised by 1
* 1-2 Vigor: PC gains 4-6 HP permanently

* 11-12 Sex change, permanent
* 13-14 Animal attraction: chance for wandering monsters increases for month
* 15-16 Bleeder: 5+ damage from a single blow causes bleeding of 1 HP/hr.  5+ HP magic healing delays bleeding 1d4 hours, only heal or remove curse permanently removes it.
* 17-18 Frenzied: 25% chance to go berserk in combat (duration 1 month): +1-6 HP, +1 to hit, -2 to AC, 25% chance to attack comrades once foes are defeated
* 19-20 Geas to find the death mask of Ptoh-Ristus (3-66)
* 21-22 One random attribute is permanently lowered by 1

* F. Horatius Interfector, Sorcerer
	* Statue: A wiry man dressed in tunic, sandals, and a strange open-faced helmet. He carries a skull in one hand and a human femur in the other.
	* Magical Effect: Horatius represents power over the past. He snaps the following, in Mithric: Deeds of the dead are known to me; of those that were, ask your questions three. The PCs can then ask up to three questions about the past. Horatius answers questions directly, but economically.
	* Negative Effect: the liquid in the basin roils unsettlingly, before a number of undead crabs (2 per party member) clamber from the basin to assault the intruder(s)
		* SZ M; AL N; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 3; HP 20, 18; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/2-8; MR 25%. Special defenses: half damage from piercing weapons; turned as spectres

### 4-165: Tunnel to SL5-1

* This long tunnel snakes through the earth and rock, damp and slippery with mud, descending 75’ to the lizardman caves (SL5-1).
	* The lizardmen have dug 3 pit traps covered with a screens of reeds and mud.
		* The pits are 20' deep, with filth-smeared wooden stakes (2d6 falling, 1d6 stakes, 2-in-6 chance of disease).

## Level 4: 166 - 180

### 4-166: Wet Cavern

* This cavern is damp and dripping. Two deep pools of fresh water occupy either side of the cave.
	* Clear humanoid tracks lead to the north (lizardman).
	* A spear is lodged in the rock next to the opening of the north passage, topped with a human skull spiked with primitive darts.
	* The southern passage is narrow, rocky, and twisty, debouching 30’ above the floor of 4-181.
		* Obvious and fresh bloodstains dot this passageway, left by Gillen and his gang (4-180) dragging corpses to 4-181.

### 4-167: Blue Pillar

* This ancient chamber has a ruined dome of light-blue tiles, supported by a 25’-tall hexagonal pillar (5’ per side) of blue marble.
	* The floor is littered with broken tiles and blue dust.
		* A clear path leads east to 4-163.
	* On each side of the pillar, at human head-height, is carved a bas-relief of a face.
		* First Face (northeast): A very handsome, youngish man with lively eyes, trim beard, and empty sockets where the eyes should be (an accurate portrait of Priscus Pulcher), now defaced (broken nose, worn features, and ancient graffiti (Mithric) “Betrayer!“).
			* Not the usual image of the Philosopher, but this is a Sortian face (new) and can be activated with Sortian eyes.  Unique combos:
				* Gold-Gold: Teleportation
					* All within 5’ are teleported to area 6-48
				* Gold-Sapphire: a magic mouth speaks (Mithric)
					* "They are sure to be watching the pillar, now that Priscus has been executed and the League dispersed. So much for the way of negotiation. Let Livia cajole. I, Macrinus, tell my fellow Sortians that we must arm ourselves! The Order and the Temples respect only strength. Perhaps a taste of their own medicine will make them more amenable to our demands."
					* GM Note: references the fate of Priscus Pulcher. Livia the Lictor and Macrinus Furiosus were other Sortian leaders who differed in approach; Livia favoring discussion and Macrinus warfare (see SL11-13 and SL11-15). Also refers to the Order of Thoth and the temples (of Thoth, Set and Horus), who opposed the Sortians.
		* Second Face (east): A dignified middle-aged woman with aquiline nose, pursed lips and narrowed eyes.
			* The pupils are sized to hold ancient gold solidi (1” diameter, 1/4” thick).
			* If two are inserted, the coins disappear and all within a 20’-long cone in front of the face are teleported to the antechamber to the audience chamber of the Governor’s Palace in the ruins of Arden Vul.
			* That room collapsed long ago; now users arrive 10' above the rubble pile at AV-29, falling for d6.  Surprised travelers have a nice aerial view of the palace, including the stump of the Obelisk of the Moon (AV-28).
		* Third Face (southeast): A monstrous face, with sharp cheekbones, pronounced supra-orbital bones, a thin, elongated nose, and unnatural eyes [a varumani].
			* The mouth is opened in a flattened oval, just big enough to hold one of the troll thegn’s passports (av items).
			* If a passport is placed in the mouth, all standing in a 20’-long cone before this face are teleported to 7-1 in the troll thegn’s domain.
		* Fourth Face (southwest): formerly a Set-animal, now almost obliterated.
			* Only the characteristic square ears of the animal remain.
		* Fifth Face (west): a long, narrow face of a man with a pronounced cranium, sharp chin, and crooked nose (a caricature of a priest of Thoth), wearing an ibis medallion.
			* The pupils of the face are small (1/2” in diameter), sized for ancient silver pennies.  If two are inserted, all in a 20’-long cone before the priest’s face are teleported to the Great Hall of Thoth (3-123).
		* Sixth Face (northwest): A wizened, goblin face with pointed ears and pointed teeth in its grinning mouth.
			* The nose is absent, leaving a 3”-diameter, 1’ deep hole.
			* Placing a gem (any value) in the hole teleports all in a cone before the face to the old workers’ quarters, now the goblin king’s court (SL4-53).
* This chamber is the destination for the Sortian face at 6-48. Arrivals find themselves standing at the south side of the room, facing the blue pillar.

### 4-168: Stairs Down to SL13-9

* These stairs descend 700’ through several direction changes to the checkpoint at SL13-9. 

### 4-169: Blocked Corridor

* The corridor here is completely blocked by a cave-in.

### 4-170: Entrance to the Precincts of Set

* This small room marks the southern boundary of the Set cult’s power.
	* Pilgrims can rest before the long trek up the stairs to the red bridge (4-120a) and the Forum (4-2).
	* Two 10’-tall portable ‘statues’ of Set stand on either side of the stairway.
		* They are made of wood and plaster, and are painted brightly.  Cave moisture has rendered them moldy, and the pain is beginning to run.
		* One statue is of a man with bone-white face and bright red hair; the other has a human body but Set-Animal head.
	* The chamber is lit by continual lights placed on the heads of the statues.
* Note: if the submerged door at AV-39 was recently opened (within a few days or so) and the southern swamp drained, both statues are gone and the chamber is marked by signs of a massive flow of water. The Set cult will replace the statues within 1-4 months.

##### 4-170a: Supplies

* The Set cult stores some supplies in this ruined corridor segment, behind a wall of force.
	* The shimmering wall is impervious to assault, but lowers for 1 Turn if touched with any Set was stick (new).
* Inside are substantial digging supplies (picks, hammers, shovels, sacks), rope and pulleys for EX-15; a spare basket for EX-15, and three crates of weapons marked with the imperial seal.

### 4-171: Ancient Hall

* The stairs from 4-177 lead out of the water into a large, brightly lit, dry chamber.
	* The ceiling rises 35’ above the floor.
	* The southern entrance is 25’ up the south wall; the north door is at floor level.
		* Directly below the south entrance is a Thothian teleportation ring (BK-RE-BL-GR-YE-WH). No glass activation squares are present.
		* The north door once led to an important suite, but the corridor has collapsed.
	* A platform at the same level of the south entrance stands 15’ inside the room.
		* A narrow stair leads down from this first platform to a second platform, from which two staircases reach the floor.  Both platforms are carved from a single block of stone.
	* The walls are impressively decorated with bas-reliefs depicting the first and third mysteries of Set on the western and eastern walls (see 4-23 and 4-111)
	* Four 25’ statues of Set in Set animal form flanking both entrances.
		* Each statue features fist-sized blue quartz eyes (250 gp each) (there are no negative effects to removing these eyes).
* Numerous corpses dot the floor of the chamber.
	* One corpses carries a scroll with 200 year-old adventuring notes.
	* A token of Arden (av items); chain mail +2; hammer +2; an enchanted spear named   Treefeller (new); a scroll (garrulous mouth (new), stinking cloud, gust of wind, cloudkill); a scroll (lightning bolt, fire shield); 34 gp; 56 sp, a bundle of adventuring notes.
* From the south entrance shapes can be seen moving around on the floor of the chamber. 
	* These are shadows under the control of the spectre.
	* The spectre lurks on the second, lower platform, hoping to surprise anyone who leaps from the entrance corridor to the higher platform.

Adventuring Notes (approximately 200 years old)
* The lost tagma is dominated by a witch they call Deino; she is performing foul sorcery on them such that they no longer appear as legionaries.  They have occupied the old administrative center of the priesthood of Thoth. Whipped on by her spells, they took Gaius and Theodoric.
* We fled to the great cavern, where Ptarmis’s great work has reverted to savagery.  There we lost our minions to the fungal people.
* We finally fled to the west, and down a set of long stairs.  We spent [hole in manuscript] at the thegn’s court, where we rested before attempting to find the old exit of Set.
* GM Note: refers to the beastmen of Level 3 (3-123 to 3-162) and to Deino (3-158), evidence for the transformation of the lost tagma into beastmen.  References the great cavern (3-163 and 3-172) and the fungal foresters that inhabit it, and finally to the troll thegn’s court (7-75).

6 shadows: SZ M; AL CE; AC 7; MV 120; HD 3+3; HP 24, 21, 20, 20, 19, 17; #AT 1; Dmg 2-5. Special attacks: STR drain. Special defenses: 90% undetectable; +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold.

X / 52
### 4-172: Cave of Lost Colossi

* A strong breeze blows from north to south through this flattened, sandy cave. 
	* Moisture drips from the walls (the Set cult keeps the area sanded, so the floor is only damp).
		* Booted tracks lead to the north.
	* 3 smooth granite heads (10’ tall) with stylized generic features rest at crazy angles in the sand.
		* The pupils of each are missing.
		* The cave moisture has caused numerous runnels of water to stain their faces.
	* The tunnel north is broad and even; east is rocky and difficult.

* Note: If the submerged door at AV-39 was recently opened, draining the southern swamp, the sand is gone and the three colossal heads are piled up against the southern entrance.  Signs of the passage of a large volume of muddy water will be evident.
	* Passage between 4-172 and 4-178 will be impossible for 4-7 days, until the Set cult levers the heads out of the way.

### 4-173: Caves

* This area is uneven and dangerous due to the moisture that covers all the rock surfaces.
	* Numerous beautiful flowstone formations and stalactites dot the area.
	* Halfway up the northern protrusion is the encrusted body of a priest of Set, who died here after his leg was fractured.
		* It would be easy to miss the skeleton unless one clambered all the way to the end of the protrusion.
		* Near the body are a broken deacon’s was stick (new), an ebony wand of trap and secret door detection (16 charges), and a silk purse (2 huge rhodochrosite gems, shaped like eyes for one of the colossi in 4-172, 2500 gp each).
	* The southern tunnel is quite narrow, appearing as if it will peter out, but it continues to the fissure (4-174).

### 4-174: Fissure

* This fissure is not particularly wide, but extends 75’ below and 50’ above the level of the two entrances.
	* The walls are craggy and slick with moisture.
	* The entrance tunnels cannot be seen from one another without actually entering the fissure.
	* A pod of chasm cephalopods lives here; very hungry from lack of traffic.

6 small chasm cephalopods (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 2; HP 14, 13, 13, 12, 11, 8; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-3/1-3/1-4; MR 25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

### 4-175: Wet Cave

* This cave is damp, with numerous stalactites of all sizes.

##### 4-175a: Tunnel Down to SL12-13

* The northern tip of 4-175 turns into a 4’-diameter, natural tunnel.
	* It slopes upward through multiple curves, until reaching SL12-13. 

### 4-176: Pitiful Scene

* Small stalactites line the ceiling, and dripping water sounds throughout the cavern.
	* Two 2’-tall, doll-like figures huddle by a small light in the center of this long cave.
		* They huddle around a 3” tall magical light emitter shedding light in a 15’ circle.  One is motionless, while the other sobs and weeps over its companion.
		* The dolls are two of Kerbog Khan’s automatons.  A piercer crushed one fatally.  The other, with a surprising degree of sentience, is mourning its companion.

Cheren (Corbel)
Checheg (Cobban)

* The ‘living’ automaton, Cheren (Corbel), is made of wood, metal strips, and bone.
	* She is dressed in the simple clothes of a female peasant.
	* Cheren is distraught that her friend, Checheg, has been rendered ‘inoperative.’
		* She is certain that Kerbog Khan will not accord him a burial, and will render aid to any who bury Checheg with dignity.
			* Should explorers comply, Cheren accompanies them for two weeks.
		* Checheg is a masterpiece of automaton and would sell to a wizard or magical collegium for a substantial sum, which would completely alienate Cheren.

Cheren
* Cheren can walk at a 15' speed, or will ride in a backpack.
* She chatters the entire time, with a sharp tongue, offering a running critique of her carrier’s actions.
* She knows accurate information of her route from Kerbog Khan’s workshops to Level 4 (they fled from SL12-13 to 4-175a, and then to this location).
* She places the magical light in her chest cavity for transport.

Kerbog Khan
* Checheg build a small talisman that blocks Kerbog's ability to track / control automatons within 10' of it.  It's on his body.  Cheren doesn't realize its significance, and will leave it behind, making her visible to Kerbog again.
* Kerbog Khan may attempt to seize control of Cheren’s brain and eyes (10% cumulative chance per encounter).
	* Her eyes will glow bright yellow and a deep, masculine voice echoes from her.
	* Kerbog Khan’s ability to control his automatons declines with distance, so Cheren would be relatively safe if taken outside of Arden Vul.
	* To fully release her from Kerbog Khan’s control would take a sage and several spells. 
* Kerbog Khan first negotiates and then, if necessary, casts spells through her.
	* He interprets ‘necessary’ as any circumstance in which Cheren’s new friends attempt to prevent Cheren from doing his direct bidding.
	* Immobilizing her limbs and physically holding her mouth closed, can prevent Kerbog Khan from interacting by speech or spell.

8 piercers: SZ M(x4) and S(x4); AL N; AC 3; MV 10’; HD 3(x4) and 2(x4); HP 22, 19, 18, 15, 14, 13, 11, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 3-18 (x4) and 2-12(x4). Special attacks: 95% to surprise prey.

Cheren, one of the children automatons of Kerbog Khan (see new monsters): SZ S; AL NG; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 13; #AT 1; Dmg 1-2; MR 20%. Special defenses: immune to cold.

### 4-177: Flooded Hall

* This ancient hall is flooded 10’ deep, with the ceiling another 10’ above the water.
	* The western wall collapsed centuries ago, leaving an impressive rock fall looming out of the water.
	* The southwestern tunnel enters the hall 10’ above the water line.
	* On the floor of the hall, under 10’ of water, is a heavy iron chest (75 lb).
		* It is trapped with explosive runes.
		* A rod of rulership (15 charges); Ritha Ferk, an enchanted battle axe (new), two ancient maps, and two 10-lb platinum bars (2,500 gp each).
			* The maps disintegrate if the chest is opened underwater.
* The waters are home to 6 water ghouls, who attack any swimmers.

6 lacedons: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’, 90’ swimming; HD 2; HP 15, 15, 13, 12, 10, 10; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

### 4-178: Rocky Cave

* A steady breeze blows from the northwest to the south through this uneven, 20’-tall cave.
	* Two large standing boulders (10’ tall) bisect the cave.
		* The southern boulder is flat-topped (10’ long by 4’ wide); an abandoned cache of dungeoneering equipment atop it.
			* 10 spikes, two 11’ poles, two 50’ coils of rope, a bullseye lantern, 4 flasks of lantern oil, a packet of chalk, a dozen marbles in a leather pouch, and a scroll of cure serious wounds.
	* Subtle (2-in-6) bare footprints in the mud lead northeast (lizardmen).
	* (1 in 6) signs of struggle and bloodstains lead towards 4-179.

* Note: if the submerged door at AV-39 was recently opened (within a few days or so) and the southern swamp drained, the boulders are piled up against the southern entrance, the dungeoneering equipment is gone, and signs of the passage of a large volume of muddy water will be evident..
	* Passage to the south will be possible, but slow.
	* After 4-7 days, the Set Cult pushes the boulders back into the center of the chamber.

### 4-179: Ruined Hall

* A tall (30’), damp cave, with a large boulder in its middle.
	* Carved by water over the past millennium, leading to the collapse of what had been a major hall in antiquity.
	* Remnants of it and its connecting corridors are glimpsed throughout the room at various points.
		* West, 20’ up the cave wall, is a corridor fragment holding a nest of giant rats (they attack only if their nest is threatened).
		* East, 15’ up the cave wall, is another corridor fragment to a forgotten section of the main stair (4-180).
		* 3 tips of ancient columns project 2-4’ out of the rocky debris of the cave floor. 
	* Blood trails (1 in 6 to detect) lead both to 4-180 and 4-166.
	* Gillen and his gang (4-180) are content to observe PCs who pass through this cavern.
		* If the PCs investigate the entrance to 4-180, they will take aggressive action.

12 giant rats: SZ S; AL N(E); AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4(x3), 3(x3), 2(x3), 1(x3); #At 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: 5% chance of disease.

### 4-180: Stair Remnant

* A party of evil adventurers led by Gillen the magic user has discovered this inaccessible, and dry, segment of the old main stairway.
	* From this base, they ambush visitors to the Forum (4-2), keeping any valuables and selling captives to the Guild of Service (see 4-11, 4-12 and 4-13).
	* They have 4 prisoners, bound in the southern bit of stairs.
* Tressa set a tripwire across the opening to 4-179.
	* It drops a large rock on the head of the first person through the entrance to 4-180.
	* Deals 1d6, may knocks the victim to the floor of 4-179 (another 1d6+3 damage).
* The fragment of the old staircase bears an unusual but lovely frieze of the second mystery of Set (4-48) (1000 gp if somehow removed and sold).
	* Images of a priest, circular room, the sandstorm, scorpions, and audience.

* The adventurers are cautious and careful.
	* They do not relish combat with equals, and are happy to negotiate if pressed.
	* They prefer to threaten from the (relative) security of their fastness (since PCs won’t know that it is a dead end).
* Two days ago the robbers ambushed a prosperous merchant and his guard in 4-178.
	* They are waiting for the right moment to sell the survivors.
* Gillen is aware that the Set cult will begin looking for the culprit(s) after a few more ambushes.
	* The gang will move on within 2 weeks when the PCs first encounter them.
	* Relocate them elsewhere in the upper Halls (maybe in Level 3 or SL-3).
* Cinna Minux, the vampire (7-122), has charmed Gillen, Tressa, and Quade; he occasionally pumps them for information about Level 4.
* The gang's loot
	* 849 cp, 707 sp, and 846 gp; one large carpet (175 gp, but heavy); two casks of fine brandy (60 gp each); and three lion pelts (75 gp each).

	* He's was on the way to look for Callista, who had stopped reporting.

Ulf the Dim, 2nd-level male Wiskin fighter (prisoner): SZ M; AL NE; AC 10; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 17; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 17, INT 7, WIS 8, DEX 14, CON 16, CHA 13. 
* Ulf was one of Mogret’s bodyguards, and is possible henchman fodder. He is stupid and mean.

Stylesia, 3rd-level female Archontean fighter (prisoner): SZ M; AL LN; AC 9; MV 120’; HD 3; HP 27; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 16, INT 7, WIS 10, DEX 15, CON 16, CHA 9.
* She was also one of Mogret’s bodyguard. She is smart and loyal, but afraid of insects.

Bestor, male Archontean messenger (prisoner): SZ M; AL NG; AC 10; MV 120’; HD 1-1; HP 5; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon.
* Bestor is a messenger from Lord Burdock (see World of Archontos appendix).
* He appears weaselly and weak, and the Guild of Service declined to purchase him from Gillen.  The robbers are stymied, and trying to decide what to do with him.
* Lord Burdock might redeem him for 200 gp.
* Bestor is tougher and more loyal than he looks, for he has successfully concealed the message in his anus.
* Ironically, the message contains a secret offer of alliance between Lord Burdock and High Priestess Stephania.
* That information would be politically damaging to Lord Burdock; it could be sold to him for 5,000 gp or to Keko the Lame in Narsileon for 7,500 gp (see World of Archontos appendix).
* Bestor did not recognize the Guild of Service, which is why he did not explain his mission to them; he was told to speak only to the high priestess.

Gillen’s spell book: burning hands, charm person, dancing lights, detect magic, Frigg’s flatulence (see new spells), friends, magic missile, read magic, sleep, spider climb; darkness 15’ radius, detect invisibility, false trap, Frigg’s caustic kisses (see new spells), mirror image, stinking cloud, web; fireball, hold person, protection from normal missiles, water breathing.

### 4-181: Stalactite and Stalagmite Cave

	* There are finished sections west, north and south, with smoothed walls and floors. 
		* The northernmost wall has a section of living mosaic (new) depicting the Red Bridge of Set (4-120a); 25% chance some sort of activity is going on there. 
	* The chamber center and three entrances are natural caverns from subsequent geological activity, their floors rocky and covered with debris.
	* The area is damp, the walls coated with the light-purple fungus common to this area (see 4-184).
	* Dozens of stalactites and stalagmites have formed in the center and north. 
		* Most are slender, with four pillar-sized stalagmites amid the smaller ones.
			* An ancient roper, lurks among these large stalagmites, feeding on beetles and other vermin, but hoping for better prey.
	* The bodies of 3 dead mercenaries (part of Mogret’s guard, see 4-180) have been dumped from the passage to the north (the roper has only partially devoured them).

1 roper: SZ L; AL CE; AC 0; MV 30’; HD 11; HP 80; #AT 1; Dmg 5-20; MR 80%. Special attacks: six poisonous strands (20’-50’ range; reduce STR by 50% in 1-3 rds). Special defenses: immune to lightning; take half damage from cold.

* The entire area is covered with the crackly light-purple fungus (for effects see 4-184). 

### 4-183: Stair Fragment

* Amid the light-purple fungus (for effects, see 4-184) ubiquitous to these regions stands this fragment of the ancient stairway to Set.
	* A recent minor cave-in has revealed the corpse of an elite guardsmen of Arden Vul, dead over 1,400 years. 
		* The guardsman wears a suit of imperial field plate +2 (av items, needs 100 gp of repairs by a skilled armorer).
			* It will inevitably draw attention from the envious and suspicious; wearing it near imperial officials will lead to arrest, while the greedy will attempt to relieve the wearer of it.

### 4-184: Cave with Spiders

* This wide spot in the tunnels is slightly drier than the others.
	* A pack of huge spiders lairs here, their webs and nest in the northwestern extension.

Letter
* (Mithric and then Archontean translation) "Although he loved nothing more than the mundane work of stone carving and preparing the dead, the greatness of Theskelon could not be denied … after his demise, his followers prepared a resting spot hidden from view but close at hand.”

### 4-185: Stair Fragment

* This area of corridor leads to a mostly-collapsed section of the old main stair.
	* It is inaccessible to the golems in 4-187, but not to the beetles of the area.

### 4-186: Fungus and Beetle Cave

* This large, flat cave is covered by the ubiquitous, light-purple fungus in this section of the Halls (see 4-184).
	* The fungus has drawn a sizable colony of boring beetles (15 total, 8 here at a time).
		* Subtract random encounter casualties from this number; the beetles will replace 50% of their number within two weeks. 
		* They are ravenous and swarm their prey (no penalties as they crawl over each other to reach their targets)
	* In the northern section of the cave a sinkhole has opened a hole to one of the lost entrance halls.
		* The hole descends 5’ before opening into the ceiling of 4-187 (the floor of is another 30’ below).  Over time this hole will slowly increase in size.

### 4-187: Ancient, Partly-Ruined Hall

* Once a sumptuous meeting halls near the entrance to the complex of Set, this chamber has been newly uncovered thanks to the sinkhole in 4-186.
	* The northern, eastern, and western walls are still in good condition, but the southeast corner has collapsed.
	* The area has succumbed to the light-purple fungus (see 4-184).
		* 4 boring beetles feed on the fungus.  They attack if the fungus is damaged.

		* Behind the dais stand two gruesome and rotting flesh golems (the mage's creations).
			* He ordered them to prevent all from seizing the chair, which he discovered shortly after the collapse of order in Arden Vul.  When he sat down to admire his treasure, the golems followed his poorly worded orders, went berserk, and ripped him apart. 
			* They still follow his instructions, and attack any who approach the dais.

2 flesh golems: SZ L; AL N; AC 9; MV 80’; HD 9, HP 40, 40; #AT 2; Dmg 2-16/2-16. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to most spells, although fire and cold spells slow them.

### 4-188: Battle Cave

* This damp cave holds the decomposing husks of three huge spiders and one giant boring beetle.
* The creatures were drawn here by the light purple fungus that coats these caves (for effects see 4-184) and slew each other.

### 4-189: Warning Cave

* A fairly strong breeze blows from the north through this large cave towards 4-190.
* Two mostly-skeletonized adventurers have been spiked to the north wall, spread-eagled.
	* They wear rags of clothing, but carry no equipment.
	* They are animated by the priests of Set.  If they perceive motion, the rotting skulls chatter out in unison (Archontean): “Lord Set watches his districts with care. Depart, ye unbelievers, lest he smite you in his wrath!”
* The knob-like rock protrusion on the south wall is a natural basin filled with clear water.
* The narrow opening (4’ wide) of the tunnel to the east is difficult to spot.

* Note: if the submerged door at AV-39 has been recently opened, draining the southern portion of the swamp, signs of the passage of a large volume of muddy water will be evident, and the animated skeletons will be gone. 

### 4-190: Exit to Cliff Face (EX-15)

* The cave exits the cliff face 650’ above the valley floor, or 850’ below the plateau.
	* The Set cult has a pulley system attached to an iron bar which can swing out into the air to raise and lower a wicker basket big enough for two humans with gear, attached a set of thick ropes .
	* When not in use, the basket, ropes, and pulleys are stored inside the entrance.
	* There is also a stone chest holding spikes, hammers, ropes, and a signal lantern with crimson panes.

* Note: if the submerged door at AV-39 has been recently opened, fraining the southern portion of the swamp, then the equipment, pulley, and basket will be gone.
	* Signs of the passage of a large volume of muddy water will be evident.
	* Until the Set cult has repaired the damage (after 3-7 days), there will be no easy egress from this cave to the valley floor.

* The mountain lion (EX-14) may take an interest in those investigating this area.
* Roll to see if any other creatures are currently using the cave entrance:
