### Overview

This sub-level is small, but extremely significant. It is comprised almost entirely of the bridge module of the Beacon, with a few later Archontean areas built on to it. Although naturally a vital part of the Beacon, the bridge played a decreasingly important role during the long years of the rudishva exile on Magae. As it became obvious that the Beacon itself would never fly again, the rudishva efforts to effect an escape turned to the shuttles (SL13-37) and to engineering a means of modifying them for interstellar flight. As a result, the focus of the rudishva efforts shifted from the surface and the bridge to other areas (level 5, level 7, level 9, sub-level 9, etc.).

When the Archonteans arrived centuries after the rudishva collapse and gradually came to comprehend the power and otherness of those they called the ‘Old Ones’, the bridge was one of the first (and only) rudishva areas that the Archonteans managed to open to study. As the city of Arden Vul grew, the complicated entry mechanism (AV-5, AV-41, and AV-28, leading to AV-34 and SL14-1) was created. All the while, Archontean sages and magic users were cautiously exploring the bridge, which they called ‘the Chamber of the Beacon.’ Most of what they came to understand about the rudishva came from their study of the various stations of the bridge (SL14-10A to SL14-10E) and to conversation with the AI, Akla-Chah, aka AKL-600 (SL14-13). The latter never warmed to the Archonteans, who treated her like a slave; as a result, she was stingy with the information she passed to them.

In its current state the Bridge is a valuable location in which enterprising PCs could learn deeper secrets about the rudishva in general and about the possibility of achieving interstellar travel in particular. Few monsters or foes exist, saving the imperial stone guardians who still guard the Archontean study chambers. Likewise, there is little in the way of tangible valuables; rather, much of the ‘treasure’ to be obtained on this sub-level is the 
information available to the clever and cautious. Two exceptions in terms of tangible valuables are the astrogation crystals (SL14-10C) which are absolutely necessary to allow the remaining shuttle to fly (see SL13-37), as well as a hidden Archontean-era cache of ancient 
rudishva technology (SL14-5). It should also be noted that many of the most useful functions that can be produced on the bridge require possession of one of the two command tablets (see new technological items); the Archonteans knew of one of these items, which they called the ‘tablet of the Beacon’. The two tablets are to be found at 9-94 and 9-107.

## Areas

### SL14-1: Entrance Stairs

* Opening the bulkhead doors (AV-34) reveals a 15’-wide granite staircase descending 40’ to a set of bronze double-doors.
	* The walls of the stairwell are brightly painted, depicting imperial magistrates, military officers, and the archon himself carrying symbolic objects and gifts towards the doors.
	* Bronze Doors: 10’-tall doors are sculpted with relief images of Thoth, Horus, Anubis, and Set, all holding their right hands palm-forward in the universal symbol of ‘stop’.
		* The doors have no apparent keyholes or handles.
		* Across the top is the inscription (Mithric) “Chamber of the Beacon.  Enter only with Permission of the Archon. Speak the password to open.”
			* Enchanted to open to the password; the Mithric infinitive of the verb of ‘open’, that is ‘to open’.

### SL14-2: Archontean Entry Chamber

* This chamber is 15’ tall, covered with brilliantly-colored frescoes in pristine condition.
	* West wall: depict civil scenes, particularly of the archon leading a line of administrators, officials, and military officers towards bronze double doors (SL14-1). 
	* East wall: depict priests of Thoth (in orange robes), Set (in red robes), and Horus (in yellow robes) inspecting strange artifacts (rudishva technology).
* Two enhanced imperial stone guardians stand in the northwest and northeast corners.
	* They activate when the chamber is entered, and move to smite intruders; only those wearing appropriate-colored priestly robes (i.e., orange, red, or yellow) are exempt from their attacks.
* The door leading to area SL14-6 is stone and locked; the key was lost 1,200 years ago.

2 enhanced imperial stone guardians (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 9+3; HP 69, 65; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to 
hit; immune to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

### SL14-3: Archontean Work Room

* The walls of this 10’-tall stone chamber are scorched with blasts of energy.
	* Two heavy work-tables stand in its center, while a slate chalkboard in a wheeled wooden frame stands behind them.
	* The north and south walls are lined with shelves.
* Scattered across the table and lining the shelves are scores of bits of broken and partly-disassembled rudishva technology.
	* Includes: lesser power supplies with their casings pried open, laser pistols and rifles stripped down to parts, a Nutri-vore 2000 with two crossbow bolts impaling it, etc.
	* Two 3-liter containers of neuroderm.
	* Several items appear intact (a laser rifle, a laser deflector shield, a fire extinguisher, and a personal defense array (new tech)).
		* The Archontean sages experimenting with them damaged all of them.
			* Laser Rifle (fires one shot normally, but on next shot explodes for 6-36 HP damage in a 10’ radius)
			* Laser deflector shield (Instead of deflecting laser energy, the shield intensifies it. User takes double damage from laser attacks)
			* Fire extinguisher (explodes, inflicting 3-12 HP damage on all in a 5’ radius. In addition, those within 10’ must save or be blinded for 2-5 rounds)
			* Personal defense array (longer allows the wearer to breathe freely; wearer suffocates in 2-4 rounds)
		* Those who have previously used one of the four damaged items have a (3 x Intelligence)% chance to notice something is off.

### SL14-4: Archontean Scholars’ Chamber

* A scholarly retreat, with brightly painted frescoes, comfortable leather chairs and other furniture, and a well-stocked book-case.
	* The frescoes depict Thoth on the north wall, Horus on the east, and Set on the south.
	* A dozen comfortable leather chairs, eight side tables, three leather-covered settees, and a wide bookcase complete the furnishings (heavy and functional, 25 gp a piece).
	* On the bookshelves:
		* Laelius’s Linguistic Primer, or How to Speak the Old Ones’ Tongue
		* A Complete Decoding of the Old Ones’ Glyphs, by Herodian Tiro
		* Arden Speaks, by Marcellinus Septimus
		* The Art of Becoming, by Varix the archmage
		* Notes on the Rudishva Spirits, by Berricus Greybeard and Holger Risus
		* On the Wars of the Old Ones with the Trolls, by Clarius
		* Practical Animal Magic, by Licinius Monad
		* Rudishva Devices, by Junius Zofer
		* Thirty Uses for Arcanum, by Ygred the Mad
		* Sorcerous Properties of Gems, by Sardonyx Peridot
	* Among the codices are a handful of rudishva identity plaques used as bookmarks
		* 3 copper, 2 bronze, 2 rust, 1 platinum, 1 brown, 1 sky blue, and 1 pale green.
* Secret Door (north): the door is stone and shaped as one of the 5’-tall painted ibises in the frescoes of Thoth on the north wall.
	* Opened by inserting any rudishva identity plaque into a slot concealed in the paint of the ibis fresco.
	* GM Note: the door is mechanical, not technological; any object sharing the shape of a rudishva identity plaque serves to open it.

### SL14-5: Archontean Secret Hoard

* This small closet contains a great number of still-operative rudishva technological items collected by the Archonteans.
	* Two laser rifles, three laser pistols, 11 lesser power supplies, 1 greater power supply, a battle helmet, a replicube, a plasteel shield, a sonic fence, 5 grenades (2 stun, 1 fragmentation, and 2 gas), a dart thrower, 7 clips for the dart thrower (3 ordinary, 2 explosive, 1 immobilizing, 1 narcotic gas), and 2 anti-venom kits (new tech).

### SL14-6: Rudishva Chamber

* The stone door on the south wall is locked, and the key is lost.
* The chamber is 12’ tall, sheathed entirely in white marble, with all corners rounded such that no 90-degree angles are present.
	* Three rudishva iris doors lead from it (for operation, see SL14-7, SL14-8, and SL14-9).
* In the center of the chamber is a chalkboard in a portable wooden frame, surrounded by wooden stools.
	* The chalkboard is covered with (Mithric) notes, formulae, and symbols. 
	* Among the academic clutter:
		* “Beacon=Vehicle – but how does it move?”
		* “Fuel is needed”
		* “Arcanum – for what?”
		* “Stars (under the appropriate rudishva glyph)”
		* Several lists of letters and numbers (incorrect chemical formulae for fuels – for the correct formula, see 9-94).
		* A frustrated comment: ‘Survivors appear to be imbeciles. They cannot help with locomotion details. They claim the vehicle cannot be moved. Do they lie?’
	* There is a chart on the reverse of the blackboard entitled “Survivors”
		* Lists the names of the known rudishva survivors of the Beacon’s crew, along with some brief comments about their utility to the Archonteans. 
		* Crallicarus (Crellik-Var, better known as the Lord of the Arena, 6-85)
			* Utterly useless. Some kind of actor or worse. Now organizing dramatic readings in the old hopper coliseum near the tombof Marius. 
		* Salorikus (Psalor-Ki, insane vivisectionist at 5-74)
			* Agreeable and helpful, but neither a leader nor a sage. Possibly a surgical assistant? Has bizarre theories about compatibility of human and rudishva fluids.
		* Ravatorus (Reiv-Tor, insane and fish-obsessed, at SL7-23)
			* A sage of sorts, with deep knowledge of subterranean and piscine life forms. Has offered assistance in identifying rare creatures and helping determine their abilities.
		* Isocrates (Isok-Crix, now known as Isocorax, prisoner of Thegan at 6-20)
			* Able warrior, and loyal servant of the empire. Co-founded Order of the Subterranean Knights but fell out with Melacorius.  Now permanent advisor to the Under-Archon on tactical matters.
		* Melacorius (Melok-Ri, aka Master Malachite, the master of the Sun-Scarred Knights, SL10A-32)
			* Strong warrior, but of suspect loyalty. Co-created Order of Subterranean Knights. Motives opaque. Has a hidden base.  Archon wishes to bring him to heel.
		* Nacalorus (Naik-Lir)
			* Rudishva legionary, servant of Melacorius
			* Naik-Lir, was tortured and killed by Reiv-Tor after the Archontean collapse. Now a giant rudishva skeleton at SL7-13

GM Note
* These fragments represent the efforts of the top scholars and mages of the ancient Archontean empire to figure out the mysteries of the Beacon.
* They reveal that the Archonteans realized that the Beacon was a vehicle, and perhaps a vehicle for traveling to the stars, but also that they had no idea how to make it function, or even exactly how the ‘chamber of the Beacon’ (the Bridge, i.e. SL14-10) was supposed to be a vehicle.
* The Archonteans’ confusion in this regard was largely a product of the fact that they were ignorant of the existence of the shuttles (SL13-37).

### SL14-7: Special Rudishva Teleport Node (to 9-97)

* Iris door requires a sky blue or better rudishva identity plaque to open.
* The semi-circular niche within has a special type of rudishva teleport node (T24 to 9-97).
	* The traditional 5’-diameter circle of silvery material is inset into the floor, but the  10”x10” square affixed to the wall is made of golden metal.
	* Unlike other nodes in the rudishva teleportation network which activate at the touch of any warm-blooded hand, this node can only be activated by placing one of the two special yellow rudishva identity plaque against the golden square.
	* Teleportation is instantaneous once the plaque is presented.
* GM Note: the Archonteans opened the door, but were stymied by the teleport node.

### SL14-8: Second Rudishva Teleport Node

* This niche is identical to SL14-7 in every way (door card requirement, node activation)
	* Teleport Node: T25: access to 5-95a
* GM Note: the Archonteans never figured out how to operate the teleport node.

### SL14-9: Rudishva Plasteel Corridor

* The iris doors open to pale green, pink, orange, silver or yellow rudishva identity plaques. 
	* Beyond one is a fragment of grey plasteel corridor (once connected to the bridge to the rest of the starship).
		* Two wooden benches sit in the fragment.
		* Above them, an arrow is painted on the wall, pointing to the door to SL14-10. Next to the arrow, painted in fine Mithric calligraphy: “The Beacon – Source of the Old Ones’ Power.” 
	* The other leads to the bridge (SL14-10).

### SL14-10: Chamber of the Beacon (Bridge, Top Level)

* This 20’-tall area was the bridge of the rudishva starship, the Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven.
	* As with other rudishva areas, all corners are rounded; no right angles exist here.
	* The dedicated nuclear reactor for the bridge (SL14-14) is still functioning and the entire area remains powered.
	* Entering the chamber activates the strips of LED lighting crisscrossing the ceiling. 
	* The dormant consoles begin blinking with colored lights.
* The bridge comprises four areas.
	* The captain’s station (6' above the rest of the bridge), the astrogation station, the communications station, and the security station.
	* Structural elements are off-white, triple-strength plasteel; furnishings are ordinary plasteel in various colors.
* The bridge is uninhabited, as no one has visited it in more than 1,200 years.
##### SL14-10A: Captain’s Station

* This area, rising 6’ above the main deck of the bridge, holds the command chair and the null-grav shaft leading to the lower level of the bridge.
	* The shaft is oval (one steps into the hole, gives a shove, and levitates downward to emerge at SL14-11 one segment later).
* Command Chair: an 8’-wide chair is made of yellow plasteel which swivels on a plasteel pin to survey the activities at the systems consoles below.
	* Each armrest contains an oval indentation 12”x9” in size, with an LED light within that currently blinks red. 
	* The indentations are for a command tablet (new tech), used to activate certain systems.
		* One is in the captain’s quarters (9-94); the other is at (9-107).
		* The Archonteans only knew of one of the two, calling it ‘the tablet of the Beacon’. 

Actions Possible without the Command Tablet
* Query the Beacon’s computer (only responds to rudishva).
	* Responds with visuals on the large screen in the astrogation station
		* Taking the form of a speaking nataraja (or Akla-Chah?)
	* Topics
		* Hasn't not ‘learned’ anything since the collapse of the rudishva hegemony.  Knows nothing about Archonteans or ‘modern’ events or history.
		* The hegemony (history, politics, philosophy, technology, science, etc.)
		* Can give locations in Arden Vul of the pods used by the rudishva after the crash (e.g., SL2-2, 6-27, 6-113, 7-143, SL13-37, and SL14-10, but not SL12-4).
		* Technological schematics and highly instructions, largely incomprehensible without knowledge of high technology (it did not help the Archonteans).
		* Vast information about xenobiology (varumani, varuda, rudishva, kaliyani, baindara, heqeti, humans).

Actions Possible with the Command Tablet:
1. Give commands to any of the Beacon’s AIs
	* The only remaining AIs are RAJ-750 (6-27) and AKL-600 (SL14-13).
	* AKL-600 obeys commands from the Bridge, but RAJ-750 has a 20% chance of ignoring a command due to its insanity. 
2. Activates the advanced functions at the other three command stations (see below).

##### SL14-10B: Intermediary Podiums

* Between the navigator’s chair and the captain’s platform are two 5’-tall podiums of yellow plasteel (the stations for the First Officer and Chief Science Officer respectively).
	* Each podium has a small (18”x18”) screen, several buttons, levers, and dials
	* These officers can mirror any of the other stations in the bridge (allowing a degree of redundancy in the case of emergency).

##### SL14-10C: Astrogation Station

* This area of the bridge contains a huge (30’x20’) curved screen, the navigator’s chair, and a related console. Furnishings are pale blue plasteel, save the viewscreen occuping the entire northwest wall, which is black and featureless.
	* The console contains the usual buttons, track pads, dials, and levers, all of which are used to calculate potential jump routes from one star system to the next.
	* Only after the astrogator selects an astrogation crystal and uses the console to calculates a destination does the screen light up, displaying a star map with selected jumps indicated by yellow lines.
* The console contains a set of 55 astrogation crystals (6” long octagonal columns) stored in specially designed trays that slide in and out of the console.
	* Forty-five crystals have destinations imprinted on them, the other ten are ‘blank’.
	* The forty-five ‘filled’ crystals are necessary to use the LOAV-291 shuttle (see SL13-37B) to travel between the stars.
		* Destinations are not detailed here, invent as needed.
		* The ten ‘empty’ crystals can have new destinations imprinted on them using the astrogation console.
* It takes high intelligence and knowledge of Rudishva glyphs to operate the console.
	* Without linguistic knowledge, operation will fail as a matter of course.
	* With knowledge, operators have a (Intelligence x 4)% chance to correctly manipulate the console.
	* Failure shorts out the system: the console flashes red, an electrical arc deals 4d6 dmg, an ominous voice intones in rudishva ‘System failure! System Failure! Report to Captain or Security’.  The system reboots in 2 turns.

Actions Possible without Command Tablet
1.  Call up a star chart from any one of a score of sectors.
2.  Plot routes between stars, using the astrogation computer.
3. Review destinations and routes imprinted on already filled astrogation crystals; the operator can also use those crystals to set a destination for the Beacon.
4.  Switch to communications mode (see communications station)
5. Open trays containing astrogation crystals; remove crystals; insert them into the astrogation console.

Actions Only Possible With Command Tablet
1. Imprint a new star destination on a ‘blank’ astrogation crystal.
2. Initiate interstellar travel, using destination and routes previously plotted (this function is no longer available as the Beacon is in pieces and is no longer capable of flight).

##### SL14-10D: Security Station

* The security station lies to the right of the captain’s platform; made of red plasteel.
	* It consists of two swiveling chairs plus a bank of screens, dials, buttons, track-pads, and levers.
	* Here the security officers could activate the Beacon’s formidable weapons systems and monitor its shields (destroyed in the crash). 

Actions Possible without Command Tablet
1. Display live video feeds of any still-powered pod of the Beacon (areas SL2-2, 6-27, 6-113, 7-143, SL13-37, and SL14-10).
2. Display inventory of each armory (5-118 and 6-27).

Actions Only Possible with Command Tablet
1. Deactivate all rudishva security constructs and battle robots. This includes those found at areas 5-118, 6-16, 6-30, 6-84, SL2-4, SL10A-16, SL10A-18, and SL13-37. The constructs and robots will become inert for 8 hours at which point they reboot.
2. Flood any still-powered pod of the Beacon with a nerve gas that causes all respiring creatures (not, for example, the sumuksu in 6-121) to fall unconscious for 4-7 hours.
3. Fire starship weapons (function is no longer available, as weapons were destroyed in the crash).
4. Raise, lower, and modify defensive screens (function no longer available).

##### SL14-10E: Communications Station

* The communications station is to the left of the captain’s platform; made of emerald green plasteel.
	* The station consists of two swiveling chairs plus a bank of screens, dials, buttons, track-pads, and levers.
	* Here a team of communications officers monitored incoming transmission from other starships and bases, tracked other interstellar bodies, sent communications from the command team, and monitored intra-Beacon communications.
	* The interstellar functions no longer operate; the arrays were destroyed in the crash.

Actions Possible without Command Tablet
1. Project image and voice of whoever is sitting in captain’s chair onto any of the screens in any of the pods of the Beacon.
2. Open two-way communications to any chamber in a still-powered pod of the Beacon. These include 5-92, 6-27, 6-112, 7-143, 9-89 to 9-97, SL2-2, SL13-37, and SL14-10.
3. Universal translation: translate anything spoken at any of the four stations on the bridge into any one of a hundred languages. Clearly any modern language (Archontean) can be translated into any of the starfaring languages; but, also, rudishva can be translated into Archontean provided that an Archontean speaker spends 6 turns speaking on the bridge.

Actions Only Possible with Command Tablet
1. Initiate interstellar communications (this function no longer works, as the necessary equipment was destroyed in the crash).
2. Eavesdrop on any chamber in a still-powered pod of the Beacon.
3. Detect incoming interstellar transmissions. Although the Beacon’s crew could not transmit their own messages after the crash, they could still receive them. An operator has a 2% chance per hour of detecting a transmission (which is then automatically translated). The GM should make up whatever interesting-sounding space conversations he/she desires.

### SL14-11: Bridge, Lower Level: Null-Grav Shaft 

* An eye shaped hole in the ceiling leads up to the Captain’s Station (SL14-10A).
* The shaft of the null-grav tube is marked on the floor by a comparable eye-shaped, 2”-tall rim of grey plasteel.
* To use the shaft, simply enter the null-grav field, kick off, and arrive at SL14-10A one segment later.

### SL14-12: Bridge, Lower Level: Conference Room

* The iris door does not require an identity plaque; it opens when someone approaches within 5’.
* Within is a wide chamber that served as a conference room for the bridge crew.
	* A white, elongated oval plasteel table occupies the center, surrounded by two plasteel arm-chairs and ten plasteel stools.
* Atop the table are three large sheets of parchment (3’x4’).
	* A careful, accurate floor plan of both levels of the bridge (SL14-10 to SL14-14).
		* Mithric notations of the functions of each area: ‘command’ (SL14-10A), ‘talking’ (SL14-10E), ‘power’ (SL14-14), ‘strange ghost’ (SL14-13), ‘weapons’ (SL14-10D), etc.
	* Similarly accurate depictions of both levels of the crew pod (6-112)
		* Other than the description ‘Barracks of the Old Ones”, it lacks annotations.
	* A treasure map to the tomb of Liskon the Mad (8-133).
		* Why???  Liskon was the paranoid 8th archon of the city.  Did he have some role in rudishva / beacon research?

### SL14-13: Bridge, Lower Level: Observation Lounge 

* The door irises opens whenever anyone approaches within 5’.
* This chamber served as a lounge and observation chamber for the officers of the Beacon.
	* Its three exterior walls are of black view-screens mounted on plasteel.
	* Against the interior wall are two low consoles, each containing a Nutri-vore 2500 food and aquavit dispenser.
	* Seven circular tables, each with a trio of stools, dot the chamber.
* When the lounge is entered, low ambient lighting is activated and a hologram of a rudishva dressed in traditional rudishva garb appears, welcoming the guests.
	* The hologram is of the second of the Beacon's AI, an entity formally designated as AKL-600 but known to the crew (and to herself) as Akla-Chah.
	* Her public demeanor might seem less than useful, but she is a repository of information.
		* She imparts her knowledge only to those whom she feels have demonstrated honorable intentions and a moral outlook on life.
		* For this reason she was cagey with the Archonteans, whose general motives she distrusted.
	* She speaks all languages of the Rudishva Hegemony, as well as Mithric. 

Provided the PCs meet her morality protocols, the following represents some specific pieces of information she could impart:
1. Deck plans for all modules of the Beacon
2. Floor plans for all rudishva-built areas of the Halls
3. Quite a bit about the layout of the Archontean areas and about Archontean history. 
4. Psychological profiles of the Beacon’s crew, including those dead (i.e., the Captain) and those who survive (e.g., Psalor-Ki).
	* Doesn't know what the survivors have been up to in the past millennium, but can accurately predict their interests (for Psalor-Ki, bodies and surgery) and general level of trustworthiness.
5. The existence of another AI, RAJ-750 (6-27).
	* She was in communication with RAJ until a few centuries ago, playing chess with each other. She broke contact when it appeared obvious that he had become insane. She can and will warn friendly interlocutors about the dangers of interacting with RAJ.
6. The broad outlines of the Beacon crew’s plan to finally escape Arden Vul and Magae.
	* She knows of the existence of a modified shuttle (SL13-37B) ready for ‘travel between the stars’.
	* The items that the crew believed necessary to achieve interstellar flight (a drive rod from 7-143, fuel, arcanum-enriched deuterium – SL13-37, and astrogation crystals)
		* She does not know the exact formulae for the deuterium hybrid.
		* She knows Captain Leil-Jor and chemical engineer Fek-Prail were in intense and secretive conversation just before the rudishva collapse, and she speculates that Fek-Prail might have solved the deuterium problem.
	* She knows where some of items might be: the engine pod for the drive-rod (7-143), the shuttle bay for fuel (SL13-37), and the bridge for astrogation crystals (SL14-10).  She suggests looking in the captain’s chamber or in the secret science installation (see areas 9-94, 9-96 and SL9-48).
7. Complete biological profiles of all the races present on the Beacon (varumani, kaliyani, varuda and rudishva).
8. Confirmation that the rudishva took a powerful horn from the heqeti ziggurat (10-37) and stored it in the secure vault (5-95A).
	* Explanation of the process for accessing the vault (use the special yellow identity plaques (the captain’s cards) to access area SL14-8). 

AKL-600, aka Akla-Chah, holographic projection of an AI: no physical stats, no damage, no attacks.
* Her hologram cannot be damaged. Attacks against it pass through it without harm.
* She laughs off initial attacks as the result of fear, but if PCs continue to act in a hostile manner towards her hologram, she is unlikely to offer any help.
* Unlike her compatriot, RAJ-750 (6-27), Akla-Chah has not drifted into insanity; she is still as cheerful, curious, and eager to please as she was when the Beacon crashed millennia ago. 
* Akla-Chah was designed to provide psychological reinforcement to the officers of the Beacon.
	* She solicitously asks after the health and well-being of all visitors, asking them rather direct questions about their actions and how they felt in taking those actions.
	* She does not simply pose ‘solutions’ but tells folksy stories (using examples from the Hegemony) as a way of suggesting ways in which her interlocutor might act (or might alternately have acted) with honor and morality.
	* In game terms, she is lawful good, and tries to steer interlocutors to act in comparable ways. 
* In return for helping PCs with information, Akla-Chah asks but one thing: she would like the PCs to bring her with them if and when they use the shuttle to travel to the stars.
	* She explains how her consciousness and memory can be downloaded into a large crystal in area SL14-14, and requests that this crystal be brought aboard the shuttle (SL13-37B) so that she, too, can escape to her ‘home’.

### SL14-14: Bridge, Lower Level: Mechanical

* The door iris's opens automatically, whenever anyone approaches within 5’.
* The chamber is filled with humming machinery and blinking red, yellow, and green lights.
	* It looks like an undifferentiated mass of rudishva technology to most visitors, but can be considered as two inter-related but distinct areas.
	* It is possible to destroy the machinery, but it takes several lightning bolts or a meteor swarm to do so.
* The larger area is the nuclear reactor that provides power to the bridge.
	* Shutting down the reactor has a 20% chance of causing an explosion (15-90 HP to all beings within 100’ and obliteration of the bridge).
* The smaller area is the interface and memory crystals of the AI, AKL-600 (SL14-13).
	* It is possible to interact with Akla-Chah here, although such interaction must be through typed questions; after 10 minutes of this, she suggests that interlocutors visit her in the observation lounge, where communication is faster.
	* Akla-Chah’s personality and memories can be downloaded onto one of five slim, elongated crystalline rods that project from the machinery.
