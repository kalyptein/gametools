## Overview

The central feature of this sub-level is a massive cavern, warmed by geothermal energy and covered by a thick layer of burbling red mud (SL9-3, SL9-32, SL9-54). Numerous rock pillars and outcroppings rise from the mud, as do many random and several fixed geysers of hot, mineral-rich water. The mud and the geyser-water have numerous magical and practical uses, a fact recognized by nearly all of the peoples that have settled in Arden Vul. The rudishva built a small research station in the northeast sector of the great cavern (SL9-41 to SL9-49). When the kaliyani fled the halls following their betrayal of their rudishva masters, they made their way to this level, where the heat and moisture were more conducive to their natural biological states, and where there was plenty of arcanum (see new magic items) to fuel their sorcery. Vestiges of their habitation are found at SL9-50 to SL9-53. Eventually the kaliyani left Arden Vul for regions deeper within the Underearth.

About twenty years ago, a renegade band of kaliyani abandoned their main settlement of Lissak-Tol and made their way here, hoping to recover some of their lost technological 
heritage and to reoccupy the Halls. They have delved a small, but well-guarded outpost to the east of the main cavern (SL9-59 to SL9-78) and named it a consortium, even though this act direct contravenes kaliyani custom, which only allows eleven consortia, all traditionally ruled by males. Their central chamber (SL9-72), with its three deep pits, has given the area its name. Even more recently, the kaliyani enslaved a small tribe of renegade lizardmen (the Lagrok tribe) dwelling in the southern reaches of the cavern. The lizardmen live in the side caves above the mud flats and use rickety rope bridges to travel between the rock outcroppings. The lizardmen hunt mud crabs, mud worms, and lizards that they trap from above, and spend the rest of their time sifting the mud for valuable minerals and arcanum for their kaliyani masters. 

General Construction Notes
* Heqeti areas: SL9-27, SL9-30
* Rudishva areas: SL9-41, SL9-41A, SL9-43 to SL9-49, SL9-52, SL9-53

* They have not yet discovered the ancient rudishva base (SL9-41, SL9-43 to SL9-49).

Environment
* The sub-level is hot and humid thanks to the geothermal activity that gives rise to the mud flats (SL9-3, SL9-32, SL9-54).
* Travel on the hot mud is slow as well as dangerous thanks to numerous mudpots and mudsinks (for which, see SL9-3).

## Sub-Level 9: 1 - 15

### SL9-1: Ledge and Tunnel to SL8-15

* This ledge, 20’ above the mushroom cave (SL9-2), leads to a tunnel to SL8-15.
	* From SL9-2 it is hard to spot (as concealed door).
	* The lizardmen are ignorant of its existence.

### SL9-2: Mushroom Cave and Ledge

* This ledge rises 10’ above the floor of the mud flats (SL9-3), home various giant mushrooms the lizardmen find delicious.
	* Numerous specimens of aqua vitae, cloud cap, and white rib giant mushrooms.
	* Close by the northern wall is a lone midnight rose plant (flora).
* The lizardmen have connected this ledge to their rope-bridge network
	* This bridge rises 10’ to meet the outcropping at SL9-4.
	* The bridge is attached to two iron posts hammered into the stone at the ledge's lip, and is made of numerous ropes of twined creepers of an unfamiliar sort, interspersed with boards on which to walk (rope and boards come from kaliyani trade with the Underearth).
	* The bridge is safe, but unsuited for combat or other activities requiring concentration or movement.
* Despite their interest in this area, the lizardmen are mystified by disappearance of tribe members here (victims of the phase spiders from SL8-15).

### SL9-3: Southern Mud Flats

* The hot and humid southern portion of the main cavern rises 60’ from floor to ceiling. 
	* The floor a thick (4’- to 8’-deep) layer of mineral-rich mud thrown up by the mudpots and mud volcanoes that dot the region.
		* Medium creatures (or weighing >120 lbs) move at 1/3 speed in the mud and risk falling periodically.
		* Small and agile creatures, or larger/heavier ones with 'mud-skis' (av items), can skim the surface at 2/3 speed.
		* A mud boat can move at 30'.
	* There are no fixed geysers here (as in SL9-32), but numerous mudpots and mudsinks.
		* Mudpots are spots that burble constantly, occasionally throwing up impressive sprays of superheated, mineral-rich mud.
			* 1 in 4 chance per 3 turns of a mudpot erupting nearby, dealing 1d6 fire in a 20' radius from steam and hot mud.
		* Mudsinks occur when the swirl of the geothermal currents cause the mud to be sucked downward.
			* 1 in 6 chance per 3 turns for a mudsink to appear in a given 10’ radius.  Randomly choose 1d2 party members to roll 3d6 under STR or be sucked down and drowned in 1d3 rounds.  Free allies can make attack rolls vs AC 3 to locate and rescue a companion.
		* The lizardmen recognize the sound of impending mudpots and mudsinks and are never caught unless unable to move.
	* Glows of campfires are visible from several rock outcroppings that rise from the flats.
	* Slogging about in the mud flats will attract the attention of mud worms and the lizardmen on their rope bridges.
* The mud flats are home to numerous strange life forms, most small and harmless crustaceans and arthropods with strangely colored carapaces.
	* Voracious mud worms (new) hunting the smaller creatures and the occasional lizardman or kaliyani who falls from the bridges.
		* The worms hunt singly, appearing as encounters anywhere in the flats.  Every other round in combat with a worm, 33% chance to attract another worm.
	* Chasm cephalopods (new), also thrive in the heat and humidity.
		* Chasm cephalopods appear in groups of 6 medium and 3 large.
		* They heal 1 hp/round due to the therapeutic minerals of the mud and steam.
		* They appear throughout the flats, but especially near the geysers and SL9-35.
		* They drift towards flying creatures, and may swarm those on rock outcroppings.
		* A layer of the mud from the cavern renders one immune from the cephalopods.
			* The lizardmen know and exploit this,  but the kaliyani do not.

	* A battered mud boat has been pushed into the cave.
		* A flat-bottomed, pole-propelled skiff (30’ movement, 4-6 persons).
	* Investigating the cave gives the mud people lurking outside SL9-6 time to gather and prepare an ambush for those returning to the flats.

### SL9-6: Larger Side Cave

* The observant may notice shallow footholes bored into the stone leading up to this cave (detect as secret door).
* The cave is the site of an ancient campsite, with a fire ring, several rotting crates, some sacks, a keg of musty water, and a locked wooden chest.
	* To the rear is a hammock, holding the skeleton of Tomasion the Dirty, an ancient Archontean mage who located this sub-level and intended to milk it for resources.

### SL9-7: Smelly Cave

* The entrance from SL9-3 to this cave is blocked by a latticed fence of pointed sticks aimed inward towards SL9-7, making passage between the caves difficult (as squeezing).
* The cave proper is covered with a 2” layer of wet, nearly liquid mud.
	* A mud worm corpse lies on the floor, and the decomposing heads of 3 lizardmen dangle on strings from the ceiling.  The stink of rot fills the cave.

### SL9-8: Scene of Battle

* This cave reeks of blood and rot.
	* Numerous 2’ to 6’ rock protrusions stud the floor.
	* The atmosphere is damp, and patches of dried, cracked mud coat the stone floor. 
	* Bloated corpses of 6 lizardmen are attracting flies and small insects.
		* Amid the fresh corpses are the skeletonized remains of another dozen lizardmen.
		* Two corpses are booby-trapped.
			* One corpse has a crude shoulder-slung pouch.
				* The pouch holds shiny rocks (bait) and a cracked half-pot with a slick of green slime cupped in it.  Relatively obvious (+10% find traps).
			* One corpse lies in a patch of dried mud near an outcropping.
				* The dried mud actually coats a thin mat of green friend fronds (flora) over a 10’ pit with wooden stakes smeared with a noxious mix of excrement and strange minerals (1d6 and save vs poison or contract a serious, debilitating disease of the GM’s choice). 

* GM Note: This liminal cave is the regular site of battle between the Skreel lizardmen (SL5) and the Lagrok lizardmen (SL9).
	* New traps will be laid within 3 weeks if the existing ones are disarmed.

Green slime: SZ S; AL N; AC 9; MV 0’; HD 2; HP 12; #AT 0; Dmg special. Special attacks: convert to slime; corrosive to wood and metal. Special defenses: immune to physical attacks and all magic save cure disease.

### SL9-9: Tunnel up to SL5-25

* This long, upward-leading tunnel eventually links to the lizardman caves at SL5-25.
	* Half-way up the tunnel a 6’-tall pile of rocks partially blocks the tunnel.
		* The pile can be shifted or climbed over.
		* The lizardmen of SL9 have coated the rocks at the top of the pile with a stone slime (new); it will likely be unnoticed unless the rocks are specifically inspected.
			* It may take a few rounds of stinging, burning, flesh-eating pain to recognize what is happening. 

1 stone slime (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 9; MV 0’; HD 3; HP 17; #AT 0; Dmg special. Special attacks: turn victim to stone slime; consume wood and metal.

	* They will take risks regular lizardmen might not.
	* They are quick to support Chief Graalk (SL9-27) if combat breaks out in his hall.

9 elite lizardmen: SZ M; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+3; HP 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18; #AT 1 or 3; Dmg 3-9 (broadsword) and 2-7 (javelin), or 1-2/1-2/1-8.

weapon. Abilities: STR 14, INT 8, WIS 9, DEX 12, CON 16, CHA 
* Leutherius accompanied the Set party to SL8, and fell into the water at SL8-6A; he managed to reach SL8-13 and avoided the perils there, only to be flee the phase spiders at SL8-15 and tumble down the cliff to SL9. The Lagrok tribe captured him at SL9-2.
* Knowing how valuable his information about SL8 would be to High Priestess Stephania (4-51), Leutherius resisted all questions about ‘where he came from;’ eventually the lizardmen grew frustrated and tore his tongue out. 

Skreel lizardman, tongueless (from SL5): SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’, 120’; HD 2+1; HP 4 (max 8); #AT 1 or 3; Dmg by weapon, or 1-2/1-2/1-8.

### SL9-18: Small Rock Ledge

* This rock pillar extends from floor to ceiling.  5’ above the mud, a large ledge has been cut into the side of the pillar, creating a space 6’ tall and 8’ in diameter.
	* The ledge's size renders the pillar above it structurally unsound; 50% chance explosions or even exceptionally loud noises cause the 55’ of rock pillar to topple down onto anyone standing on the ledge (8d8 damage and flung into the mud).

		* Each panel is made of 15 plaques of carved bone wired together.
		* The striking carvings on each panel shows a fierce kaliyani warrior within an ouroboros as if they are coming straight at the viewer.
		* A small silver bell and silver mallet protrude from the screen.
		* The screen is intended to intimidate the lizardmen, who ring the bell (and drop a small offering) when they need aid from the kaliyani.
	* Their quarters include:

	* The other two scouts are supervising the lizardmen (at SL9-4 and SL9-27).
	* Spriviv is arrogant and not very watchful (+1 to surprise).
	* If confronted by a powerful opponents (and especially if surprised), Spriviv attempts to negotiate.  He only speaks lizardman and kaliyani, and will betray the party at the first opportunity.

### SL9-21: Warm Mineral Lake

* A small, warm (~90 degrees F), mineral-rich lake bisects the mud flats at this location.
	* Home to algae, a host of crabs, and a highly-adapted species of fish.
	* The lizardmen regularly fish here, but don't swim it because of toxic algae mats.
* Four mats of deadly algae float on the surface of the lake.
	* Yellow-green, with flecks of black and purple.
	* Swimming through them causes (75%) an infection similar to meningitis that kills in 1-3 months.  Unless first identified and consciously avoided, a swimmer has a 50% chance of encountering one of the mats.  They can easily be burned with fire.

### SL9-22: Tiny Rock Outcropping

* This outcropping is barely 5’ in diameter and rises only 10’ above the level of the lake.
	* Its surface is mostly taken up by a complex web of iron posts and rope guy-lines that support the two rope bridges (to SL9-28 and SL9- 24).
* 25% chance 2 lizardmen are present, using drop lines to fish for crab and fish.
	* If present, they step away every time the geyser at SL9-23 erupts, spraying the area with hot water (1d6 fire to creatures on the outcropping).

2 lizardmen (25%): SZ M; AL N; AC 4; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 2+1; HP 11, 10; #AT 1 or 3; Dmg 1-6 (club) and 1-6 (javelin), or 1-2/1-2/1-8. Possessions: clubs; javelins; shields.

### SL9-23: Hot Geyser

* A powerful geyser of hot water erupts here, rising 35' high every other turn, affecting all within a 25’-diameter circle.
	* Fliers or swimmers take 5d6 and are tossed 30’ in a random direction.  Boats are overturned, and their occupants take 2d6.

### SL9-24: Ledge of Greqillap the Undying

* This massive pillar of rock is completely coated with an electric green algae.
	* On a broad ledge 25’ above the waterline sits a 10’-tall lump, also covered with algae.
		* Chiseled into the ledge in front of the lump in 8”-tall letters (in an obscure demonic dialect) “For assistance, bring the eleven and beseech lord Greqillap seven times.”
		* Lying in front of the lump is are the corpses of two kaliyani: mauled, beaten, and cut up. 
		* If the algae is scraped or burned away, the lump is revealed to be an enormous demonic head, with two stumps of horns, a single eye, and protruding fangs.
		* Stating the name “Greqillap” seven times while standing on the ledge has a chance to summon Greqillap, a powerful and inimical being of the outer planes.
			* Base 25%, + 10% for every additional language known by the beseecher.

* Greqillap is one of the eleven senior servitors of the alien entity, Mzingaloq (see deities in World of Archontos appendix), who wait in Dripping Lyaeltok for the return of their lord.
	* Summoning Greqillap is almost certainly foolhardy; it is extremely powerful and antithetical to the races of the Prime Material Plane.
	* Once summoned, Greqillap immediately commences combat unless it spots the eleven live sacrifices (of sentient beings) that it demands before negotiation.
		* If there are no sacrifices, Greqillap attacks for 3-6 rounds before departing whence it came, all the while grunting “Where are the eleven? Where?” in its two known tongues.
	* Communication with Greqillap is difficult even with the appropriate sacrifices; it comprehends only its own tongue (the tongue of Mzingaloq) and a proto-archaic form of the LE alignment tongue.
	* Those who know the modern alignment tongue for LE are able to recognize 50% of Greqillap’s words (and vice versa); hardly any but most ardent demonologist would know any words of the tongue of Mzingaloq.
* Discussion with Greqillap
	* Greqillap can offer advice on how to weaken the activities of Rimmaq-Isfet and Kauket on the Prime Material Plane (Mzingaloq, is the arch-rival of Rimmaq-Isfet).
	* It can provide general information about the relationship between Rimmaq-Isfet and Kauket as well as specific information about how to use areas 8-76, 9-40 and SL13-10L to weaken those entities.
	* N.B.: Offering sacrifices to Greqillap is obviously an evil act.
* Information about Mzingaloq and Greqillap is extraordinarily rare; only a handful of the most ancient texts describe this alien ‘god’.
	* Those texts are carefully guarded treasures of the Order of Thoth in Archontos.
	* One such text is On the Terrible Old Gods, by Sarquin of Archontos (books)
		* Only nine copies were redacted, but several are in Arden Vul (e.g. SL10A-32).

Greqillap the Undying, a greater servitor of Mzingaloq (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 0; MV 90’, 120’ flying (Class A); HD 16; HP 128; #AT 4; Dmg 2-12/2-12/2-12/2-12; MR 45%.

### SL9-25: Fishy Cave with Trapped Entry

* Six lizardman warriors guard this cave. 
	* The north and south walls are covered with algal ropes on which fish from SL9-21 are drying.  The reek of fish – drying and rotting – is almost overpowering.
	* A rope bridge extends west towards SL9-22.
	* With the help of the kaliyani, the lizardman have rigged a trap in the western entrance to sweep incautious intruders into the lake (SL9-21).
		* A mat of discarded reeds and fish bones covers the entrance, with a trip rope hidden along the bottom.  It is connected to eye-hooks in the walls and ceiling.
		* Tripping it causes a 8’-square panel of bone, wood, and dried algae to swing down.  All intruders in the entranceway must roll 3d6 under DEX or be swept into the lake (SL9-21). 

6 lizardmen: SZ M; AL N; AC 4; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 2+1; HP 15, 13, 13, 12, 11, 10; #AT 1 or 3; Dmg 1-6 (club) and 1-6 (javelin), or 1-2/1-2/1-8. Possessions: clubs; javelins; shields.

### SL9-26: Witch Doctors’ Cave with Hatchling Pool

* Kresst Two-Toes, the senior witch doctor of the Lagrok tribe, and his apprentice Prisp, inhabit this cave.

### SL9-27: Hall of the Lizard King

* Chief Nisslok rules the Lagrok tribe from this decrepit former heqeti hall.
	* The hall is 25’ tall, supported with 3 solid columns.
	* The stone is rough and pebbled in the heqeti fashion, but no longer oily or greasy.
	* A balcony 10’ above the ground occupies the south wall.
	* The west wall is covered by a 10’-tall high relief sculpture.

	* Furnishings include 2 tripods of heating (new), 2 tattered Archontean carpets showing the coronation of two emperors (45 gp each), and Nisslok’s stone throne set against the north wall.
* Nisslok’s harem is busy skinning alive a captured Skreel lizard-man (c.f. SL5) in preparation for a feast.

* Nisslok is proud, aggressive, and unhappy about the kaliyani domination of his people.
	* Likely to try to kill and devour most adventuring parties, a very strong one might be able to negotiate with him, especially if they offered assistance versus the Skreel (on SL5) and the kaliyani. 
	* He is always accompanied by 3 aggressive females, 3 elite warriors, and a kaliyani advisor. Combat sounds bring reinforcements from SL9-17, SL9-25, and SL9-26.

	* Chief Nisslok uses the area to store his treasure, piled in a disorganized heap.
		* Two 3’-tall granite heads from Archontean statues (50 gp each)
		* A chipped but still beautiful red-and-black glazed Archontean urn, showing the 4th labor of Arden (350 gp – see SL13-10d)

### SL9-28: Watchers’ Cave 

* This small, nondescript cave overlooks the lake.
	* A pair of lizardmen sit here at all times, lazily guarding the approaches to SL9-22 (+1 for them to be surprised).
* A rope bridge extends east to SL9-22.

### SL9-29: Deserted Cave with Statue

* Dominating this spacious, sand-lined cave is an ancient and badly worn, 7’-tall statue.
	* It depicts a heqeti hopper held horizontally by a worm-like thing with numerous tentacle-like feelers extending from its mouth.
		* A few bits of coral on leather strings and twists of silver and jade jewelry sit in a wooden bowl at the foot of the statue (offerings from nervous lizardmen to the ‘god’ of the statue, 37 gp total).
	* The statue gives off an aura of doom; save versus spells or flee the area, regaining courage only when >30’ from the statue (+1 save for every 2 HD above 1st).
	* It takes careful examination to decipher the nature of the figures or spot the name 'Reestiq' carved along the right arm of the heqeti (see SL9-30).
	* The horizontal heqeti can be twisted counterclockwise atop the worm-like thing with an open doors roll).
		* A secret door (hard to detect, 1-in-8) slides open in the north wall, revealing steps that down to SL9-30.

### SL9-30: Tomb of Reestiq the Builder

* The stairs from SL9-29 lead to a 15’x20’ chamber, the false tomb of a long-forgotten heqeti builder, Reestiq.
	* In the center of the false tomb is an 8’x3’x4’ sarcophagus.
	* All surfaces in the tomb – walls, ceiling, floor, and sarcophagus - are faced in several inches of dried, flaking mud from the nearby flats.
		* The mud was carved but is worn, one can only infer they are of heqeti.
		* Treading on the mud floor causes puffs of dried mud, touching the walls causes them to flake.
		* Stripping the mud from the walls is dirty and choke-inducing; only bare stone lies beneath. 
	* The west wall has 13 long (heqeti) thigh bones sticking out from the flaking mud.
		* It is a false wall, of mud-and wattle construction, obscuring the true tomb.
		* Removing a bone creates a hole through the wall.
		* Inside the wall is a layer of poisoned dust that will be released if the wall is broken (by explorers or Reestiq bursting through).
			* All within 30’ save versus poison or die (+1 due to the poison's age).
			* Difficult to detect as a trap (the false wall might be noted).
	* The true tomb is a 15' x 15' room, also coated in mud, with another sarcophagus.
		* The images carved in the dry mud are more intact, showing an erect heqeti (Reestiq) directing other heqeti in digging, erecting walls, and carving statues.
		* Reestiq’s treasure is inside the sarcophagus.
			* 2 mud salamander charms (new – the charms convey MR 25% and fire protection, respectively), a heqeti ring (new), 16 jade bangles (100 gp each), a piece of flattened, baked mud with a sketch of areas 9-109 to 9-126 on it.
				* This ‘map’ contains other areas that were destroyed ages ago, but does indicate the secret door and stairs at 9-124/9-125.

* 5 rounds after the removal of a bone or the breaching of the wall, Reestiq leaps from his true sarcophagus and bursts through the false mud wall.

Reestiq, an heqeti old one (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6+6; HP 47, 45, 40, 39, 38, 37; #AT 1 Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue.

### SL9-31: Cave of the Skeletal Lizardmen 

* The bleached skeletons of 8 lizardmen hang from pegs thrust into walls of this cave.
	* The bones are bound together with bits of dried ligament; they rattle menacingly if touched, but are inanimate.
* A rope ladder, attached to pegs in the floor, is coiled by the ledge overlooking SL9-32. 

### SL9-32: Northern Mud Flats

* The northern portion of the main cavern averages 75’ from floor to ceiling, and the environment is hot and humid.
	* The cavern floor is covered with 5’- to 10’-deep mineral-rich mud thrown up by the mudpots and mud volcanoes that dot the region.
	* The mud in the central region (between SL9-38, SL9-33 and SL9-33) is covered in a 2” layer of warm water that slowly drains towards the lake.
	* See SL9-3 for movement across the flats, and the chance of random mudpots and mudsinks.

### SL9-33: Broad Ledge 

* This broad ledge provides a fine view of the northern flats and the geysers to the north.
	* An ancient campsite lies southeast, by the column of rock extending to the ceiling.
	* The ledge is a gathering spot for chasm cephalopods; a pod arrives within 3-6 turns.

### SL9-34: High Ledge 

* Atop the ledge is the limed-over skeleton of an orange-jumpsuited rudishva.
	* He was a senior officer in the tactical corps who fled here after suffering mortal injuries during the kaliyani rebellion. 
	* Has a biometric protection card (tech) allowing the bearer to pass any point defense array (e.g., SL9-43) without activating it.

### SL9-35: Rocky Beach 

* A terrified lizardman has been staked to the rocky beach just by the edge of the mudflats.
	* He is being sacrificed to the mud worms for questioning Chief Nisslok’s policies.
	* Every turn there is a cumulative 10% chance (max 70%) of a mud worm arriving.
	* Even if freed, the lizardman won't associate with humans or demi-humans; it will attempt to flee down the tunnel at SL9-37. 
* A pair of rotting riding salamander corpses also occupies the beach.
	* The kaliyani were hoping to use them for transporting goods into Arden Vul, but a combination of factors (including the mud worms) doomed this effort.

1 wounded lizardman: SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’, 120’ swim-ming; HD 2+1; HP 5 (max 14); #AT #AT 1 or 3; Dmg by weapon, or 1-2/1-2/1-8.

### SL9-36: Elevated Cave

* This cave lies 20’ above the beach at SL9-35.
	* The sandy floor shows signs of traffic to the east.

### SL9-37: Tunnel Down to 9-119

* This narrow tunnel wends down in a series of tight cork-screws before reaching 9-119.
	* The knowledgeable may realize many sections of the tunnel were recently constructed.
	* A tracker may notice the signs of the passage of the kaliyani advance team that has moved into the main halls (see 9-118).

### SL9-38: Northern Geyser

* A powerful geyser of hot water erupts every other turn, rising 55’ and affecting all in a 30’ radius.
	* Walkers or fliers take 5d6 damage and are tossed 30’ in a random direction.
	* The area is shrouded in mist from the geysers; the ledge at SL9-41 is hard to spot.
* Chasm cephalopods are attracted to the steam, and are often found near the geysers.

### SL9-39: Southern Geyser

* A second geyser (as SL9-38) erupts here every fourth turn, rising 35’ and affecting all in a 20’ radius.
* Mist is only present 3 turns in 4.

### SL9-40: Western Geyser

* A third geyser (as SL9-38) erupts here every fourth turn, rising 45’ and affecting all in a 25’ radius.

### SL9-41: Forgotten Rudishva Overlook 

* A ledge 40’ above the mudflats leads to a long-forgotten rudishva science station.
	* The mist produced by the geyser at SL9-38 makes it very difficult to spot the ledge without close inspection of the rock outcropping. 
	* Chasm cephalopods congregate near the geyser, investigation of the ledge is sure to attract a pod of these strange creatures.
* The science station is cut into the north face of this rock out-cropping.
	* The surfaces are sheathed with white marble, with rounded edges.
	* A white plasteel console rests against the west wall, destroyed in antiquity.
		* A lost rudishva lesser power supply is wedged between console and wall.
	* Two 4’-tall iron rods are set into the lip of the ledge overlooking SL9-32.
		* Mounted atop each rod is a yellow-and-blue cylinder with smoked glass-steel ends and several buttons, sliding switches, and glyphs along the shaft.
			* These are rudishva CompositScan 3000 mineral detectors (tech).
			* They are difficult to detach from the iron rods (20% chance to break).
			* One malfunctions slightly, and can only be programmed to locate arcanum.  The other is still fully operational.

Special attacks: surprise on 1-4; one tentacle drains spells from casters, adding 2-8 HP to chasm cephalopod per spell. 

##### SL9-41a: Winding Stairs

* The stairs leading from SL9-41 to SL9-42 are quite narrow (4’ wide) and steep.
	* They descend through the rock outcropping into the bedrock beneath the mudflats before climbing to reach SL9-42. 

### SL9-42: Low Ledges 

* A strange semi-circular hut, 9’ tall, is wedged against the southwest side of the central pillar rising amid these ledges.
	* It is made of a framework of bone with pieces of particolored leather from lizardmen and giant lizards stretched over it, spotted with mud from the mudpots that occasionally erupt nearby.
	* Peep holes allow a good view of areas to the northwest, southwest, and southeast.
* A pair of kaliyani soldiers crouch within the hut, tasked to watch over the approaches to SL9-51 and SL9-59.
	* They are unhappy with their assignment and take any opportunity to depart.
	* If imposing-looking foes approach, 75% chance they push down the walls of their hut, and launch on their mud skis (av items), hightailing to SL9-59 to report the intruders.  If closely followed, they stop at SL9-59 to fight, having strict orders not to reveal which is the true door into the Pits.
	* If they decide to stay in position (25%), they flee at half HP.

* A set of wide stairs sinks into the rock towards the west, becoming the narrow stairs (SL9-41A) that lead towards area SL9-41.
	* Around the mouth of the stairs ancient, charred remains of a dozen kaliyani, a number of small lizards, and a few chasm cephalopod husks.
	* To the east is a rudishva iris door (opens to sky blue or better identity plaque).
* Guarding the door are a pair of rudishva point defense arrays (tech).
	* Programmed to blast any being without a biometric scan card (tech, found at SL9-34 and SL9-44).

2 rudishva point defense arrays: SZ S; AC -2, HP 50, immune to fire and cold.  An array strikes as a 10 HD fighter, 3/2 attack rate, 6d6 damage (impedes regeneration).  Project a 3’x5’ personal force shield between the barrel and the rest of the unit; this shield 
absorbs 50 HP of laser or physical projectiles before collapsing.

### SL9-44: Rudishva Science Station: Control Room

* The iris door to the west opens to a sky blue or better identity plaque.
	* Slumped next to the door is the orange-jumpsuited skeleton of a rudishva with a laser pistol (full power) in its hands.
		* Sky blue identity plaque, rudishva biometric protection card (tech).
* In the eastern niche is a smashed, wrap-around console 4’ above the floor, and a set of three broken 10’ x 5’, wall-mounted viewscreens.
	* A heavy stone hammer rests on the floor by the console.
* Attached to the south wall by a set of clamps and brackets is a rudishva jet-ski (tech).
* In the hallway to the north are the scorched skeletons of four kaliyani.

* GM Notes: The rudishva was Cliv-Nol, a jemadar of the Tactical Corps, who together with his colleague Pejar-Bel (7-108), prevented the kaliyani from occupying the science station’s main facilities and plundering its supplies.
	* Cliv-Nol managed to slay those sent to neutralize him, and then changed the programming of the point defense arrays (SL9-43) to target all biological life forms. 
	* After Pejar-Bel sacrificed himself on Level 7, Cliv-Nol realized that there would be no escape; he destroyed the consoles here and took his own life.

##### SL9-44a: Rudishva Science Station: Empty Teleport Node

* An empty niche, with bare stone surfaces and two insets cut into the rock: a 1”-deep, 5’-diameter circle on the floor, and a 1”-deep, 10”-square section on the wall.
	* Intended for a never-installed rudishva teleport node.

### SL9-45: Rudishva Science Station: Bunkroom

* Beyond the rudishva iris door is a severe chamber with four plasteel bunks on north and south walls.
	* Beneath each bunk are two drawers.
		* 4 white laboratory jumpsuits; 2 biohazard suits (tech), 3 pairs of heavy white work gloves
		* a lump of carved granite showing a heqeti warrior with a spear (45 gp)
		* six pieces of colored glass strung together as a mobile (to hang from a ceiling)
		* a set of rudishva hand tools (screwdrivers, wirecutter, laser level, laser measure, etc.)
		* a 3’ segment of mud worm vertebrae 
* On the east wall is a strange pulsating purple light, emitted from a 3”-diameter rod suspended vertically between two plates that protrude from the wall. 

### SL9-46: Rudishva Science Station: Main Hall

* All three doors to this chamber are rudishva iris doors.
	* Only the middle door (to SL9-49) requires a plaque (sky blue or better).
	* The other two are motion activated; dilating when approached within 5’.
* This chamber is sheathed in black granite.
	* At the north end is a sunken leisure area (20’ long, 10’ wide, 5’ deep).
		* A seating ledge of comfy synthetic foam  runs around inside lip of the area.
		* A gaming table has a set of plastic geometric gaming pieces (75 gp).
		* 2 pyramidal smoked plasglass entertainment panels (3’x3’x3’), cracked and useless.
	* Opposite the door to 7-111 a 10’ x 10’ platform rises 3’ off the floor.
		* The platform is made of particolored 18” squares of plasteel – red, yellow, green, mauve, blue, black, etc.
		* An 8’ pile of mostly-skeletonized kaliyani litters the platform.
			* Mixed in with the bone are bits of fabric and broken equipment.
		* Crouching inert at the center of the pile is a stone nataraja (a rudishva animated construct).
			* Programmed by Cliv-Nol (SL9-44) to defend the chamber against all non-rudishva, the it did its part and waits for further foes.  It leaps from within the pile of bones as soon as any entity approaches within 5’.
	* a long table with attached benches to the south
	* The southern end of the hall is dominated by a 15’-long, 5’-wide white plasteel table.
		* At one end is bolted a Nutri-vore 2500 food-and-drink dispenser (tech). 
	* The west wall has an empty niche where the stone nataraja formerly crouched.

1 rudishva animated constructs - stone natarajas (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58; #AT 1; Dmg 4-11; MR 25%. Special attacks: sonic or fire attack. Special 
defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold, fire, electricity, poison, and mind-affecting spells.

### SL9-47: Rudishva Science Station: Laboratory 

* This laboratory was the heart of the science station.
	* Here the rudishva attempted to find a source for the elements and isotopes they hoped would allow them to repair and fly the remaining shuttle (SL13-37).
* The walls are lined with consoles and plasteel chairs.
	* An impressive array of equipment, screens, hardened glassware, data crystals, etc is scattered about, mostly smashed.
		* Amid the rubble: 9 usable test-tubes, a digital scale (using strange units of measurement), a set of measuring ‘spoons’, 4 packages of generic gel for creating solutions, a digitally controlled heating element, 3 heavy gloves for handling materials; a spool of copper wire (45 gp); a spool of platinum wire (245 gp); a spool of gold wire (145 gp); and 16 very small diamonds for industrial use (550 gp).
* The center of the chamber holds several free standing pieces of equipment: a pair of centrifuges, a fusion chamber, and a storage ‘refrigerator’ with environmental controls.
	* A being with sufficient understanding of advanced science could use these devices to prepare compounds, test reactions, and store results. 
	* GM Note: The GM should devise rules for operating them.
	* The equipment allows the distillation of the elements and compounds necessary to create more deuterium fuel for the rudishva shuttle (see 9-94 and SL9-48 for full information).

### SL9-48: Rudishva Science Station: Head of Station

* The austere and functional quarters of the chief science officer of the Beacon, Spiv-Kol.
	* A combination bunk-wardrobe made of yellow plasteel occupies the east wall.
	* Spiv-Kol’s yellow plasteel workstation is attached to the north wall.
		* The science officer's skeleton is slumped in the chair, white jumpsuit charred with energy blasts.
		* Atop the desk: a GnuCoder 3000 data recorder, a lump of arcanum, and two 5” squares of crystal that display 3D scenes (a gigantic waterfall at night under a sky with three moons; an image of four rudishva in strange dress).
		* Several data crystals are scattered atop and beneath the desk; most smashed.
	* Against the south wall are three wall-mounted cabinets that once held data-crystals, open and ransacked during the kaliyani attack.
	* 3 functional data-crystals survive among the debris of desk and cabinets
		* Creating D-3He Reactions from Native Minerals, Laboratory Notes of Spiv-Kol, Chief Science Officer, and Native Fauna of the Local Mud Flats (books)
### SL9-49: Stairs Down to 7-111

* These stairs are narrow and rounded, in the rudishva style, leading down to 7-111.

### SL9-50: Elevated Cave with Fiery Curtain 

* Sitting a few feet above the floor of the mudflats, this cave is spattered by eruptions from the nearby mud-pots.
	* The floor is rough and natural near the flats, becoming worked in front of the corridor leading north, with an 8’-diameter ouroboros of red marble is inset.
* Beyond the ouroboros, a fiery force shield blocks access to the chamber to the north, broken only by an 8’-tall, 4’-wide oval holding a holographic dancer.
	* The stairs beyond can be glimpsed through the aperture.
	* The figure has two legs and six arms, each holding a different object (drum, pot of fire, lotus, and dagger; the other two hands hold nothing).
		* If approached within 5’, the figure starts to dance, swiftly increasing its tempo.  After 3 rounds, the figure begins to hurl blobs of fire (unerringly, 1d6, chance to ignite combustibles). 
	* The force wall can only be destroyed disintegration.
	* The dancer does NOT respond if presented a rudishva identity plaque.

* GM Note: The kaliyani used SL9-52 to SL9-53 as a temporary residence after their betrayal of the rudishva in antiquity.  From here they moved into the Underearth.
	* As they left they sealed the small complex with the fiery veil.
	* When the kaliyani returned, they found themselves unable to lower the veil.

## Sub-Level 9: 51 - 60

### SL9-51: Cave with New Tunnel

* The mud covering the floor of this cave is only 3’ deep, with no mud pots or other thermal activity present.
	* Subtle recent construction has been done on the walls of the cave, and especially on the narrow (5’-wide) tunnel leading north).
	* When they realized they could not bypass the fiery veil at SL9-50, the modern kaliyani decided to dig a new tunnel towards SL9-52.  It was slow and laborious, only completed several months ago.

### SL9-52: Ancient Kaliyani Hall

* This large chamber lacks any 90-degree angles.
	* Every surface of the native granite is carved in medium relief, mostly depicting kaliyani battling a wide variety of enemies, including heqeti.  Floral and geometric patterns link the imagery.
	* A large ouroboros symbol of smooth black marble is inset into the floor around the central, 10' deep pool.
		* The pool is lined with white marble.  it is empty, due to a serious crack, with only a yellow-ish residue (it held kaliyani refreshening liquid, av items).
	* West is a shrine with an 8’-tall statue, red granite and white marble, of a kaliyani science officer.
		* Ancient and unusual, the rudishva did not favor monumental depictions of living individuals.  It depicts Rekkarev, the Second Science Officer of the Beacon, still held in high esteem by the modern kaliyani as a legendary hero of the kaliyani and the discoverer of arcanum.
		* The statue stands erect, wearing a modest tunic and holding a test-tube and a lump of arcanum.
			* The test-tube contains a secret compartment (detect as secret door).
				* Prising off the cap reveals a compartment with 2 data crystals: the Case for Action, and the Life and Deeds of Rekkarev (books). 
					* The Case for Action: the kaliyani have learned the rudishva shuttle is ready.  With research on their condition stalled, they suspect the rudishva are either witholding the cure, or will return with reinforcements of their people and depart, abandoning the kaliyani.  They plan to ally with the heqeti and take the research and tools in the chaos.
					* The Life and Deeds of Rekkarev: as written, but Spiv-Kol also talks about working with Rekkarev to develop the kaliyani refreshing liquid to improve their health and fertility; just a step along the path to a true cure.
	* East is a niche, in front of which are the shattered pieces of a destroyed stone nataraja (new).
* 3 kaliyani soldiers are posted here, guarding the approaches to the teleportal (SL9-53).  
	* They avoid from the fiery veil at SL9-50, but fight fiercely to defend this historic site.

* GM Notes: This area was used by the kaliyani in antiquity as a staging area after their successful revolt against the rudishva and before they departed for the underearth. 

3 4th-level kaliyani soldiers (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 6; MV 150’ on six legs, 60’ upright; HD 6; HP 42, 39, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8/3-8 (scimitars), 3-8/3-8 (javelins +1). Special 
defenses: immune to poison and mind-affecting spells. Special: infravision. Possessions: twin serrated scimitars; a sheaf of 4 javelins +1; and an assortment of silver rings, glass baubles, and minor gemstones worth 125 gp each. One of the soldiers also has a potion of heroism, one a potion of invulnerability, and the third a potion of stone giant strength.

### SL9-53: Ancient Transport Nexus

* Two of the three lobes of this small area once held rudishva teleport niches.
	* The western teleport circle has been literally ripped from the floor, the silver disk broken into fragments.
	* The northern niche is operative.  It shows signs of repair (by the modern kaliyani).
		* T23: access to area 6-32
		* Connectivity is a bit dodgy (15% chance to fail: teleporter unusable for 1d4 turns; all within the silvered circle save versus breath or take 4d6 electric).
	* The iris door to the east opens to orange, silver, or yellow identity plaques.
		* The corridor that linked to further kaliyani areas and the science station was destroyed during the rebellion against the rudishva.

### SL9-54: Western Mud Flats

* The mud flats extend to the west in a long cave that links the northern and southern flats.
	* The ceiling rises only 30’ above the mud in most places (except at SL9-59).
	* The environment remains hot and humid, with mud 5’ to 10’ deep, as elsewhere.
	* Mud-pots and mud volcanoes are common throughout the region (see SL9-3).
* Movement and risk of mudpots and mudsinks is as described for SL9-3.

### SL9-55: Mud Cells

* The kaliyani keep four prisoners here, standing up to their necks in mud.
	* They are shackled by chains to the walls of the narrow caves; the chains adjusted to  permit an unfortunate victim to just barely keep their head above the mud.
	* To keep the mud worms away, the kaliyani have erected a barrier of resin-coated logs across the mouth of the area, their tips rising 4’ above the mud.
* The prisoners emit piteous moans, and are quick to beg assistance from any visitor.

* GM Note: all were captured near area 6-43 by an early kaliyani expedition to Level 2.
	* Vig was serving as guide to a party of explorers, most of whom were killed; the kaliyani transported the survivors from 6-32 to SL9-53 for interrogation.
		* They were funded by Lady Alexia Basileon to track down the iron circlet of Ghanor.
		* The leader of the adventurers was Sir Nixion the Bold, an Azure knight of the Gosterwick sept supporting Lady Alexia (see AK-1).
	* None of the prisoners has any equipment.

Vig, lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 41 (max 50); #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or by weapon. Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Vig is in good shape, thanks to his ability to regenerate.

Nixion the Bold, knight of the Azure Shield (see World of Archontos appendix), 4th-level male Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC 9; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 13 (max 31); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 16, INT 14, WIS 12, DEX 15, CON 10, CHA 15.

Cyra Red-Eyes, 5th-level female Archontean thief: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 5; HP 9 (max 21); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 12, INT 14, WIS 11, DEX 17, CON 9, CHA 14. Thief skills: PP 55%, OL 52%, F/RT 40%, MS 45%, HS 36%, HN 20%, CW 90%, RL 25%.

Testareon, 4th-level male Archontean magic user: SZ M; AL NE; AC 10; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 3 (max 13); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 9, INT 18, WIS 15, DEX 10, CON 15, CHA 8. His spell book has been destroyed.

### SL9-56: Platform with Ancient Carvings

* A 5’ platform of ancient, cracked stone flagstones rises from the mud in this location.
	* The north and east walls are covered in middle-relief carvings of kaliyani, rudishva, varumani, varuda, and a variety of bizarre and implausible life forms.
		* All figures writhe together in a mass, making it difficult to follow a narrative arc.
		* INT 15+ or some knowledge of the demise of the rudishva hegemony might glean the following:
			* The kaliyani are larger, and hence more important than their fellows.
			* A sub-text seems to involve kaliyani stabbing rudishva with long knives.
		* The truly observant (4d8 under INT) might notice a coded message within the swirl of imagery across 25' of wall (Kaliyani): “The traitorous Hegemony is broken. Their Beacon will never rise again. We depart.”

### SL9-57: Stepping Stones

* A series of roughly-carved stone pillars rises from the mud.
	* Placed here by the ancient kaliyani, several of the pillars have since collapsed.
	* They rise 2-4’ above the mud and allow expedited movement across the flats.

### SL9-58: Alcove

* Beneath the mud of this alcove is a long forgotten troll chest (tech).
	* 3 laser rifles and 6 lesser power supplies.

##### SL9-58a: Arcanum Cave

* This extension to the main cavern is hotter and more humid than the main mud flats, and reeks of sulfur.
	* It is dominated by a huge node of arcanum (new), 45’ high and 30’ in diameter (Only a section 10’ tall and 20’ in diameter protrudes above the mud).
		* Atop the node are 6 picks, 6 heavy hammers, and 6 canvas-and-wooden buckets.
		* The normal effects of exposure to high concentrations of arcanum apply.

* GM Note: The kaliyani mine chunks of arcanum from this node to fuel their spell-casting.
	* The size of the node was one reason that Tsilliv chose to build her consortium here.
	* The intensity of the arcanum effects makes it difficult for the kaliyani to spend extended periods of time here. 

### SL9-59: Imposing Rock Wall with Many Doors

* A broad ledge rises 5’ above the mudflats here, illuminated by 5 torches thrust into the base of the western wall.
	* Muddy footprints may are obvious all across the shelf (kaliyani).
	* The dramatic wall is 45’ tall and covered in elaborate mid-relief carvings of kaliyani.
		* Every inch shows a kaliyani writhing in combat, a kaliyani dancing in ecstasy, or intertwining vines and floral motifs. 
		* Hidden among the elaborate carvings (35’ above the floor) are 3 arrow slits, allowing kaliyani soldiers in SL9-64 to attack those in the cavern or mudflats.
	* Four ledges extend outwards 5’ from the wall.
		* The northern and southern ledges are 10’ from the floor; the central two ledges are 20’ above the floor.
		* Each ledge leads to a short corridor that ends in a door, wall and ceilings also fully carved with similar imagery.
		* Hidden among the stone tracery to the south of the ledge to SL9-62 is a stone latch, which opens the door at SL9-62.
			* Locating the latch is extremely difficult; only if one guesses that a knob, button or latch is hidden among the stonework will they have a 1 in 8 chance, after 2-5 turns searching, to locate the latch.
			* Spying on kaliyani entering the Pits improves this to 1 in 3 chance per turn.

* Kaliyani Tactics: When non-kaliyani first approach the great wall, the kaliyani in SL9-64 choose silence and caution.
	* They prefer to allow the traps in areas SL9-60, SL9-61, and SL9-63 to deter visitors.
	* They take action only If the visitors discover the true door (SL9-62) and seem close to discovering the opening mechanism.
		* They ring the gong at the northern part of SL9-64 to rally more troops to the defense of the Pits.
		* Visitors may guess at defenders, due to the murder holes above the entrances, but the kaliyani don't reveal the arrow slits until useful and appropriate.  If a party retreats and returns, the kaliyani make full use of the arrow slits to soften them up on the approach to SL9-62.

### SL9-60: Ledge and Trapped False Door 

* This ledge leads to a short corridor and a false stone door.
	* The walls, ceiling, and door are carved with kaliyani images.
		* Three small, 4”-diameter murder holes blend into the carvings.
	* The floor shows muddy footprints (a false trail).
	* The stone door is circular, with a cylindrical 1” 'key hole'.
		* Inserting anything into the hole triggers a poisoned javelin trap.
			* 12 spring-loaded javelins fire from recessed holes in the carved door.  Each strikes as an 8th-level fighter, dealing 1d6 + save vs poison or die.
			* The kaliyani reset the trap within a day.
			* Simple countermeasures (e.g., using shields to block the javelins) can bypass this trap. 
* If the kaliyani guards in SL9-64 are aware of the intruders, they have asp eggs (new) ready.
	* A kaliyani can hurl one asp egg per round through the murder holes.
	* Each kaliyani has 2 eggs of fire and 2 eggs of cold. 

## Sub-Level 9: 61 - 79

### SL9-61: Ledge and Trapped False Door 

* This ledge, corridor and door are identical to SL9-60, save for a different trap.
	* The rules about the murder hole also apply here.
	* Inserting anything into the cylindrical ‘key hole’ fires a lightning bolt into the corridor (8d, save for half, dispel as 9th level).

### SL9-62: Ledge and Trapped True Door

* This ledge, corridor and door are identical to SL9-60, except:
	* The door here is the true door leading into the kaliyani pits.
		* It opens by a latch set into the carvings on the great wall (SL9-59).
	* Inserting anything into the cylindrical ‘key hole’ triggers a pair of powerful glyphs of warding (dispel as 9th level).
		* One glyph level-drains the person who manipulated the ‘key hole’ unless they save vs petrification (at -1).
		* The other strikes all within the corridor must save versus paralysis (at -1) or be paralyzed for 1d3 turns.
			* If a party is totally incapacitated, the kaliyani will take them prisoner and prepare them for a dire fate in the Pit (SL9-66).
			* If some or most are paralyzed, the kaliyani use the murder holes first before opening the door to engage the remnants.
			* If none are paralyzed, the kaliyani use the murder holes but don't open the door.

### SL9-63: Ledge and Trapped False Door 

* The ledge, corridor and door are identical to those at SL9-60, save for a different trap.
	* Inserting anything into the cylindrical ‘key hole’ triggers a delayed blast fireball in the corridor (9d6, save for half, dispel as 9th level).

### SL9-64: Kaliyani Fighting Tunnel

* This long, undecorated corridor allows the kaliyani to inflict damage upon enemies assaulting the great wall (SL9-59).
	* It runs above all 4 entrance corridors; murder holes above each allowing the kaliyani to drop asp eggs (new) on intruders within SL9-60, SL9-61, SL9-62, and SL9-63.
	* 3 arrow slits allow missile fire into SL9-59 and SL9-54.
	* Access to the rest of the Pits is via a 3’-diameter hole in the northern lobe of the corridor, descending 35’ to SL9-65.
		* Foot- and hand-holds cut into its walls, and a sturdy rope of twined, knotted, subterreanean vines is attached to a thick staple set in the floor assist descent.
* Four kaliyani soldiers are always posted in this area.
	* They are usually observant, detecting any visitors approaching on the stepping stones (SL9-57) or wading through the flats (SL9-54).
		* Invisible parties will take them by surprise.
		* The guards will be alerted (for 6 turns) if the soldiers at SL9-42 flee this way.
	* A reed basket holds 16 asp eggs (new; 8 fire and 8 cold).
	* Next to the basket is a bronze gong (100 gp) used to alert the compound.

* Kaliyani Tactics
	* If alerted, either by fleeing soldiers at SL9-42 or by spotting approaching enemies, they wait cautiously to see what happens.
	* They don't reveal themselves until enemies begin manipulating the doors (SL9-60 to SL9-63), then use the murder holes as described at SL9-60.
	* If an approaching party appears powerful, and/or is able to circumvent or shrug off the effects of the trapped door(s) and asp eggs, they ring the gong to summon assistance and use the arrow slits to shower missiles on retreating foes.
	* If a given party retreats and then return, the kaliyani don't hesitate to use the arrow slits as soon as the foes are within range.

4 5th-level kaliyani soldiers (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 6; MV 150’ on six legs, 60’ upright; HD 6; HP 44, 42, 39, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8/3-8 (scimitars), 3-8/3-8 (javelins +1). Special defenses: immune to poison and mind-affecting spells. Special: infravision. Possessions: twin serrated scimitars; a sheaf of 4 javelins +1; and an assortment of silver rings, glass baubles, and minor gemstones worth 125 gp each. One of the soldiers has a potion of heroism. Another has a potion of stone giant strength.

### SL9-65: Kaliyani Guard Room

* Four kaliyani soldiers and a kaliyani sorcerer are posted to this spartan chamber as guards for the great wall (SL9-59).
	* Simple stone benches line the east and west walls.
	* Above the benches hang two folding, 20’-tall ladders used to exit from SL9-62 to the mudflats below.
	* North, two practice dummies are suspended from the ceiling by ropes.
	* East are two niches.
		* The larger holds a basin of kaliyani refreshening liquid (av items).
		* The smaller one leads to the hole up to SL9-64
			* A rope of knotted subterrean vines hangs down from above.
	* A woven basket holds 2 of each of the asp eggs (new). 
* At the sounding of the gong in SL9-64, the guards rush to the true door (SL9-62) and send for reinforcements from within the Pits. 

Pelipev, 5th-level kaliyani sorcerer (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 6; MV 150’ on six legs, 60’ upright; HD 5; HP 25; #AT 32; Dmg 3-8/3-8/6-24 (scimitar/scimitar/blasting rod) or 2-7/2-7/6-24 (javelin/javelin/blasting rod).

a potion of heroism, and another has a flask filled with oil of fiery burning.

### SL9-66: The Pit of Torment

* The Soul Borer here is actually the undead form of Rudiga the Traitor.
	* The kaliyani unearthed his bones from his crypt in Lissak-Tol and reanimated him to help guide them back to Arden Vul and advise them in their search for bio-tech.
	* He's not trapped in the pit (he can simply leap or fly out).
	* The kaliyani hurl victims in to sate his undead hunger.

* The first of the eponymous pits that define the sub-level dominates this long chamber.
	* The walls and ceiling are completely covered in a riot of mid-relief carvings that depict a swirl of kaliyani figures, large winged creatures, snakes, salamanders, crawling bugs, spiders, and giant mushrooms.
	* The pit is 20’ deep and expands horizontally as it descends (the floor of the pit covers twice the area of its mouth).
		* A lip around the mouth rises 3’ above the floor.
		* Within the pit dwells a horrific monster from the deep places of the Underearth, a crawling soul borer (new). 
	* Leaning against the northeast wall is a ramp of wood that can be placed into the pit to allow the soul borer to exit, or kaliyani to enter.
	* In the north wall is an undecorated niche with a 3’-tall basin of kaliyani refreshening liquid (av items).
* Unless observing a torment or engaging in combat, the kaliyani do not congregate here.

* If captured by the kaliyani, victims will be tossed into the pit for 1d3 days to be tormented by the soul borer; after which kaliyani either allow the victims be killed by the soul borer (50%) or consign them to one of the mud cells (SL9-55).

* If combat breaks out here, the crawling soul borer will not be able to participate.
	* It emits high pitched keening wails as it senses the presence of victims around it.
	* If the kaliyani have time to prepare for an assault, they will place the ramp into the pit and the soul borer will be loose in the chamber. 

Why did Rudiga betray the hegemony / varumani?
* He fled with the kaliyani when the varumani / Vanara survived the attack, knowing they'd kill him as soon as they realized what he'd done.
* He was envious of Vanara's position, and chafed under the authority of the rudishva.
	* He might even have agreed with Melok-Ri and Isok-Crix about conquest.
* He plotted with Lisstak to remove Vanara and Druva during the invasion.  He would become leader of the Varumani and lead them out of Arden Vul to dominate the human lands beyond, bringing looted wealth and tech with him.

### SL9-67: Conclave of the Consortium

* This chamber and the corridor that encircles it are heart of Tsilliv’s new consortium. 
	* The walls, floor and ceiling of the encircling corridor are completely carved, in the kaliyani style, but instead of random or repetitive scenes of kaliyani and others, the mid-relief carvings here tell a clear narrative in 3’-tall panels running at eye height.
		* Starting to the east of the entry to SL9-66, they depict Tsilliv herself, from her early years as a sorceress-in-training, to her epic struggles against creatures in the Underearth, to her rise to the rank of magistra, to her appearance before the Enclave of the Eleven, and finally to her departure from Lissak-Tol at the head of a group of faithful followers.
* The hexagonal chamber within the hallway is the Conclave chamber itself.
	* Stairs descend 10’ from the ambulatory hallway.
	* The walls, floor, and ceiling are carved in mid-relief and depict generic images of kaliyani overcoming foes.
	* Two rows of benches line the north and south walls, with a central raised oval dais.
		* A wooden rostrum shaped like an asp’s head rises from the dais, with a leather whip and a strange oliphant atop it.
			* The whip is used to keep order in rowdy sessions of the conclave.
			* The oliphant (a horn of chaos (new), from the tooth of a demonic marine creature) is passed from speaker to speaker, allowing one the right to speak during conclaves.

* GM Notes: Since the kaliyani are inimical to humans, and meetings of a consortium’s conclave are private, unlikely for an adventuring party to be present during a meeting.
	* The chamber is likely to be empty during hostilities.
	* If a party infiltrates by stealth, or scryes on the Pits, there is a 10% chance a meeting of the conclave is under way.
		* At a conclave, all members of the consortium present within the Pits assemble.  The leader, magistra Tsilliv (SL9-77), presides from the rostrum.  She introduces business and acknowledges those other kaliyani who wish to speak, using the whip to indicate the speaker’s will and to silence opposition. 
		* Although conclaves are noisy and demonstrative, and frequently involve wrestling, biting, and snapping, they must end with unanimity (hence the whip).
		* In the case of this consortium, Tsilliv has a relatively easy time in enforcing her will over the others.

### SL9-68: Kaliyani Lounge

* This hall has a 20’-tall, domed ceiling and undecorated walls.
	* Off-duty kaliyani come to relax and train.
	* Simple stone benches line the walls around the doors.
	* A tripod of heating (new) stands in the northeast corner.
	* In the other three corners, practice dummies (dried mud and detritus wrapped in leather and painted to resemble lizardmen and humans) are suspended from the ceiling and floor by ropes.
		* Near each dummy is a wooden barrel with a sheaf of javelins and spears.
* Three kaliyani soldiers (see new monsters) are practicing their javelin-hurling skills.
	* They join any general alarm in SL9-66 or SL9-72 within 3 rounds.
	* If surprised here, they call out, hoping to wake their comrades in the barracks (SL9-69 to SL9-71).

		* Each bunk extends 4’ into the wall, and is 4’ tall. A curtain of woven reeds affords some privacy. Each bunk has a set of furs and leather skins.
	* 30 bunks are claimed, but only 6 soldiers are here at a time.

		* The snakes’ heads have 25 HP each.
		* The snake-heads are techno-sorcery, activated by a command word in kaliyani.

* At any given moment, 7 kaliyani are present here, conversing and enjoying the pits. 

* GM Note: One of the kaliyani soldiers here is a spy.

	* If combat breaks out here, the soldier (Serriv) will wait his opportunity to betray Tsilliv; he might be willing to negotiate with PCs who have opposed the magistra.

### SL9-74: Trade Hall

* This grand chamber is 20’ tall and brightly lit with continual light spells.
	* The native granite is sheathed in black marble, with no right angles remaining.

		* Northeast: a crouching kaliyani soldier, wielding a pair of scimitars. 
		* Northwest: an erect kaliyani scout, shading its eyes as it gazes down the corridor towards SL9-78.
		* Southeast: a standing kaliyani sorcerer, in a blowsy tunic, consulting a scroll.
		* Southwest: a six-legged lizard on its hind legs, displaying a ferocious fanged mouth.
			* Tucked behind the statue is a ecret door.  Rotating the statue causes it to rise.  A 2”-diameter hole extends all the way through the statue, into which a bar can be slid as a push-bar.
	* Worked into the marble of the south wall is an enormous (15’-diameter) ouroboros symbol, within which is the Semi-glyphik symbol for the number 12.

* GM Note: In keeping with Tsilliv’s desire for this area to appear as a ‘normal’ consortium, she ordered a formal entrance and trade hall be constructed at the point at which this complex merges with the Underearth.
	* The hope was to attract trade from other subterranean races. But the renegade nature of her Consortium, and the general racial hostility of the kaliyani towards others, has ensured that the area remains nearly empty and under-utilized.
* 66% chance of 6 derro (for stats, see SL9-76)

2 4th-level kaliyani soldiers (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 6; MV 150’ on six legs, 60’ upright; HD 6; HP 42, 39, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8/3-8 (scimitars), 3-8/3-8 (javelins +1). Special

### SL9-75 (aka 4-51b): Stairs Up to 4-51a

* The stairs are narrow, and lead upwards 650’ to the Shrine of the Snake and the cult of Set (4-51a).
* Secret Door (north): obvious from the south (1 in 2), only opens with a lift gates roll or by breaking it down.

* GM Note: When they arrived at SL9, the kaliyani discovered a long fissure extending upwards in this location.
	* It was one of the first places they explored, gradually expanding it and adding stairs. Eventually the fissure opened to a cave (now 4-51A).
	* Sensing activity nearby, kaliyani miners broke down the wall at 4-39, surprising High Priestess Stephania.  After some tense negotiations the two sides struck an alliance. To placate the Set cult, the kaliyani developed a snake shrine (4-51A) as a cover.

### SL9-76: Traveler’s Quarters

* This chamber is identical to SL9-69, except that instead of refreshening liquid, the basin at the west end of the corridor contains fresh water.
	* Tsilliv has had trouble attracting visitors; only a small group of derro occupy the area.

		* Tsilliv’s chest also contains some strange (to her) artifacts: a moldy and damp Archontean parchment quire containing a description of the chamber of the Beacon (SL14-2, SL14-9, and SL14-10), including instructions on how to access it by manipulating the obelisks (AV-5, AV-41, and AV-28); a finely smithed golden bust of an anonymous Archontean archon (3,500 gp); and orange and platinum rudishva identity plaques (tech).
	* On the south wall of the main chamber is an ouroboros, 10’ in diameter, of melted silver (200 gp), surrounding a 5’-tall image of the number 12 (also filled, 150 gp).
	* In the southeast corner is a 10’-diameter, 3’-tall basin filled with kaliyani refreshening liquid (av items).
	* In the center are 3 curved stone benches surrounding a tripod of heating (new).
	* Along the east wall are three sloped standing writing desks, each with a drawer.
		* Desk Drawers: Formal kaliyani communication is done by inscribing soft metal rods with a message, so in addition to a sheaf of parchment and quill pens, each desk drawer also holds ten 3” lead rods and sharp scribing tools. 
		* Kaastir’s drawer
			* Folded lizard-hide map of a series of passages from an area labeled ‘dead halls’ (9-109) to large cave marked ‘crevasse floor’ (9-1) to some ‘narrow passages’ (9-57, 8-23, 8-24, and 7-34) and finally to ‘ancient home’ (5-125 and environs). Along side are rough elevation notes (8-23 “200 up”, 7-34 “200 up”, and 5-125 “750 up”). 
		* Sveestik’s drawer
			* An inscribed lead rod: “To Magistra Lisskiv and the Eleven. You must accept us now, as we have located the ancestral home. Soon the ship will be prepared and we will set forth on the seas of the surface world. [signed] Sveestik, member of the Twelfth.”
				* GM: this is a taunting message, to be sent back to the kaliyani city of Lissak-Tol. It is true that Tsilliv’s people have located 5-125 and the old rudishva areas, but she has hardly plumbed their secrets, and they are still ignorant about the nature of the Beacon.
		* Tsilliv’s drawer
			* Several interesting pieces of scribed, dried lizard-hide.
				* A detailed floor plan of areas SL9-59 to SL9-79.
				* A fairly good survey of the floor of the chasm (area 9-1, including 9-2 to 9-11, 9-49 to 9-51, 9-65 to 9-67, 9-71 to 9-76, 9-83 to 9-87, 9-98, 9-99, and 9-108), with major features annotated and described (e.g., ‘mushrooms’, ‘lake’, ‘tower’, ‘river’, etc.) and the identity of a few species indicated (‘fast small pests’ near 9-4, ‘heqeti’ near 9-76, ‘dead ones’ near 9-98, and ‘flying humans’ near 9-70).
				* A listing of the Eleven Consortia of Lissak-Tol, with names of the magistra in charge of each; the name Lisskiv, of the 4th Consortium, is circled, and several epithets are scrawled next to it in kaliyani.
	* Secret Door (north, in the middle sleeping ‘finger’; locked, Tsilliv holds the key)
		* A one-way door leading to SL9-78 lies just beyond the secret door.

* The three magistra are usually present in this chamber, unless summoned to defend the consortium (in SL9-66 or SL9-72).
	* If there is time to complete a summoning ritual, she will do so with her two lieutenants before joining the fray (with elemental in tow).

Magistra Tsilliv
* Completely inimical to humankind; it is hard to fathom the circumstances in which she might negotiate with human or humanoid adventurers.
* Her goals involve the discovery and restoration of the old kaliyani and rudishva complexes within Arden Vul (especially on Level 5).
* She has vague notions of the Beacon as the ancestral ship of her people, but is unaware of its real nature.
* She has contempt for the lizardmen, even as she recognizes the value of using them in the short term.
* She will eventually make an alliance with the heqeti, but has nothing but antipathy for the varumani, the goblins, and humankind.

### SL9-78: Access Cave

* This large cave serves as the transition point between the territory of the Twelfth Consortium and the Underearth.
	* It is lit with torches, and the smells and sounds of animals is strong. 
	* The entrance to the cave from SL9-79 is blocked by a barricade of stone, rushes, and random bits of wood.
		* One section can be removed to allow passage.
		* Clambering over would take several rounds.
	* To the south and east of the barricade is a tripod of heating (new) around which 3 kaliyani soldiers, 3 scouts, and a sorcerer gather.
		* They are loosely attentive, doubting a serious threat could emerge from SL9-79.
		* The sorcerer wears a spiral horn (75 gp) on a cord around its neck.  It blows the horn three times in rapid succession should a threat appear.  The soldiers at SL9-74 are supposed to react to 3 blasts of the horn by summoning the rest of the complex to defend SL9-74.
		* When the rotation of scouts is changed, the sorcerer blows a single blast and the soldiers at SL9-74 open the portcullis and deploy the ladder to let the guards climb back into the kaliyani pits.
	* The southwestern lobe has several iron chains and collars attached to the wall.
		* Three riding salamanders (new) are chained to the wall here.
		* Nearby are tack and saddle-bags.
			* The beasts are used by Gest Felstapper in trading across the Underearth.
			* The saddle-bags hold dried mushrooms; dried meat; dried fruit imported from the surface; 5 50-lb chunks of arcanum (new); 10 2-lb gold ingots (100 gp each); and 10 20-lb gold ingots (1,000 gp each).
			* Stealing the derro trade goods provokes eternal animosity on the part of Gest Felstapper (SL9-76) and his friends.
	* The northwestern ell of the cave is filled with fresh water. Two buckets sit nearby.
	* The southeastern portion of the cave rises 15’ above the main cave.
		* It is palpably colder here, and Tsilliv uses the area to cure meat.
		* The corpses of six lizardmen, two riding salamanders, and two ogres hang from hooks set into the ceiling.  The floor is slippery with blood.
		* The one-way door from SL9-77 exits into the rear of this portion of the cave.

### SL9-79: Tunnel to the Underearth

* This broad tunnel leads to the network of tunnels, caves, and strange civilizations that dot the Underearth.
* The main kaliyani settlement (Lissak-Tol) is a week’s journey away via many forks and chambers.
