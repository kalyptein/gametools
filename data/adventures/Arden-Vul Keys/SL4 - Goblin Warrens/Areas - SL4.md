## Overview

Weskenim the goblin king (SL4-22) holds sway over a loose collection of goblin clans from a throne located in the ancient servitors’s halls, where generations of Archontean laborers, min-ers, sculptors, and builders lived under the close scrutiny of their masters.

The main feature of the sub-level is a vast two-story hall, lit by the great goblin cookfire and filled with smoky whirligigs and a wide range of aromas both pleasing and not. A series of rope bridges stretch crazily across portions of the upper hall, while rickety ladders lean against the walls, providing both access to clan-caves and transit between the upper and lower levels of the hall.

Because it is so well-populated, few surprises lurk in the goblin warrens, nor are there secret tombs and treasures. Still, many come to trade with the merchants who gather on the floor of the hall (SL4-40), and still others come to King Weskenim’s Court (SL4-23) to trade information, barter with the goblins for lost objects, and set in motion any variety of plots and dangerous missions. 

Of course, a few ‘special areas’ are scattered throughout the more mundane goblin habitations (c.f. SL4-3, SL4-12, SL4-14, SL4-15).

## Sub-Level 4: 1 - 15 (Upper)

### SL4-1: Tunnel to the Upper Halls

* Rough steps are carved into the floor of this steeply-sloping tunnel.
	* This is the main passage the goblins ascend to 5-51, and thence to Level 3.
	* 33% chance of meeting a group of goblins while traversing the tunnel.
		* 6 goblins, goal / motive rolled on ‘Goblin Goals’ in the encounter section.
		* In combat, one of the six scampers towards SL4-2 to warn the rest of the goblin community.
		* If the warning is successful, the goblins (including King Weskenim) will have a  permanent -25% to reaction rolls.

6 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

### SL4-2. Crossroads and Guardpost

* The floor of this cave is covered in sand.
	* At the lip of the steep tunnel downward to the west (SL4-2a) a dim glow can be spotted (the torches at the western edge of area SL4-3).
* A goblins commanded by a sergeant lurk on a ledge 10’ above the eastern passage.
	* The goblins wait with a cowbell, hoping to gauge visitors’ intentions.
		* If visitors seem peaceful, the sergeant hails them, swings down from the ledge, and begin negotiations, urging them to check in with Reskim at SL4-4.
		* If the visitors seem hostile, the goblins will toss a rock towards area SL4-2a.
			* They hope the sound of the rock and the light from below draw the visitors close to the western slope, at which point they pull a rope connected via eye-holes on the ceiling to the trap at SL4-2a.
			* If the trap doesn't send unwanted visitors down the western slope into SL4-3, the goblins furiously ring their cowbell and fire arrows at the intruders, awaiting reinforcements from SL4-4 and SL4-11.

1 goblin sergeant (as an orc): SZ M; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1; HP 7; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8 (morning star) or 1-6 (short bow). Possessions: morning star, short bow.

6 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (spear or short bow). Possessions: short bow, spear.

##### SL4-2a: Steep Slope with Trap

* To those entering the goblin warrens from the north (SL4-1), this steeply sloping tunnel appears promising, with a slight glow of light is visible in SL4-3 from the top of the tunnel.
	* The slope prevents the hydra in SL4-3 from escaping its pen
	* A rectangle of woven wicker (15’x10’) is attached to the ceiling, just above the lip of the tunnel here.
		* The western edge of the frame is attached to the ceiling by a stout metal hinge; the eastern edge is held up by a rope running through eye-holes set in the ceiling to the ledge on its eastern side.
		* The goblin guards can release the rope, letting the frame swing down and swat those standing at the lip the slope (save vs paralyzation or tumble down the slip (d4 damage) to face the hydra).
	* Sharp, hidden stakes point downslope, slowing climbers (+3x difficult terrain).

### SL4-3. They Call it “Mr. Heads” 

* The goblins have raised a lernaean hydra from an egg and keep it in this crumbling, 15'-tall hall, where it serves simultaneously as a mascot of sorts, as a symbol of goblin potency, and as a defense mechanism for the warrens.
	* The western door has a view-hole so that the goblins know when it is safe to bring food and straw to the hydra.
	* A pair of torches in sconces to either side of the door render the chamber smoky, dim, and foul. 
	* On the north wall is a huge, faded fresco of a pair of eyes and lashes, gazing down on a mass of goblins, humans, and demi-humans wielding pickaxes, mattocks, hammers, and chisels in a crowded, blurry mass.
	* The floor is filled with straw, partly decomposed corpses, and hydra-dung.
		* Amid the debris: shield +1, +2 versus fire, a star ruby (1,100 gp) in a piece of hydra dung, a yellow glass activation square, and a scattering of 189 sp.
* The goblins are immensely proud of their ‘pet’ and have given it the affectionate name of ‘Mr. Heads’.
	* Slayers of the hydra earn the permanent enmity of all of the goblin clans, though they likely conceal it initially. They may "thank" the visitors for ridding them of such a dangerous threat, even as they maneuver them into an ambush (e.g. at SL4-7).
	* The goblins are looking for a female hydra to provide company for Mr. Heads; they might well task a friendly party with such a mission, promising up to 15,000 gp for an egg that produces a female (e.g., one of those at 9-149). 

Mr. Heads, the seven-headed lernaean hydra: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 7; HP 56; #AT 7; Dmg 1-8 (x7). Special: regenerates two new heads in 1-4 rounds if fire is not applied to the stump. 

### SL4-4. Overlook and Bailiff

* Fresh sand covers the floor of this natural cave.
	* The east end of the cave contains the remnants of a worked corridor, floored in cracked, white marble, its walls blackened with soot, and the bridge that once extended across the main hall (SL4-5 and SL4-40).
		* Reskim keeps a pile of old furs and skins here as bedding.
* Reskim the Bailiff resides here, tasked by King Weskenim (SL4-22) with collecting appropriate ‘inducements’ from visitors to the Goblin Warrens.
	* He is seat behind a flat-topped boulder "desk".
		* A bobcat skull (625 gp as a curio) provides a centerpiece.
		* He bears a "sceptre of office" (a crufted up platinum rod, actually a platinum key to the Obsidian Gates).
			* Stealing it provokes the enmity of all the goblins; Reskim is quite popular.
	* 3 chattering goblin guards and Reskim's pet bobcat accompany him.
	* The bailiff is friendly enough, eager to hear news of exotic locales and brave exploits.
		* Visitors are expected to offer a gift to King Weskenim (Reskim will helpfully remind visitors of this need): 10 gp / person for an initial visit, and 1 gp / person for return visitors.
		* Reskim expects an equal gratuities for his services.
			* If not forthcoming, he may provide misleading information, including sending parties towards the pit at SL4-11.
			* If suitably bribed, he'll give active advice, assistance.
				* A bone-and-hair token guarantees an audience with the goblin king.
		* Only if visitors refuse to pay the king's gift does Reskim grow hostile.

Reskim the bailiff, a goblin sub-chief (as a hobgoblin): SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 1+1; HP 8; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8 (long sword). Possessions: long sword, "sceptre".

3 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 5, 4, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (short sword) or 2-7 (military pick).

1 bobcat (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1+3; HP 7; #AT 3; Dmg 1-2/1-2/1-3. 

### SL4-5: Upper Great Hall

* Rising 75’ from floor (SL4-40) to ceiling (top of SL4-5), the Great Hall of Labor dominates this sub-level.
	* Its smooth, finished walls were once covered with titanic frescoes illustrating the virtues of labor and craftmanship, showing benevolent orange-robed priests directing human, goblin, and other laborers at various activities, including masonry, stone-carving, and digging. 
* Several areas of the upper level of the Warrens open onto the Great Hall (SL4-4, SL4-14A, SL4-17A, SL4-18A, or SL4-23a) enter the upper Great Hall 50’ above its floor
	* Thus the ceiling of SL4-5 is 25’ above these regions of the upper Warrens.
	* Unless noted, no balustrades or similar exist to provide safety.
* While the lower level (SL4-40) is well-lit and rings with the clamor of goblin activity, the upper level is relatively quiet.
	* A small glow can be seen from the brazier at SL4-23, but the ballista stations (SL4-14A, SL4-17A, and SL4-18A) are all shrouded in darkness.
	* Careful listening (e.g. from the lip of SL4-4) might catch snatches of goblin conversation from several points around the hall.
	* Immediately visible from any access points are fragments of brightly-colored frescoes (now damaged by smoke and grease) and the scores of small, harmless lizards which scamper along the walls, bridges, and overlooks.
* Secret Door (north): must be climbing the wall or flying in the Great Hall to notice it.
	* A 4’-square panel slides to the left.

### SL4-6. Main Ladder

* A 55’-tall vertical ladder of wood, bone, and twisted hemp leans against the edge where SL4-4 intersects with the open vastness of the Great Hall.
	* The ladder extends 5’ above the floor of SL4-4, allowing one to mount with ease.
	* It extends downward to the floor of the main hall (SL4-40).
	* The ladder is 5’ wide and quite rickety, though numerous guy lines attached to the wall ensure its stability.

### SL4-7. Rope Bridge

* A 4’-wide bridge of rope and wooden slats stretches west from SL4-4 to SL4-8.
	* Both ends are fixed to iron rods hammered into the wall of the Great Hall.
	* Those weighing or carrying more than 150 lb will have trouble navigating it.
		* +1x difficult terrain, and 25% chance of punching through one or more slats (3d6 under DEX to avoid falling 50').

### SL4-8. Goblin Barracks

* This former overseer’s chamber is occupied by 20 goblin warriors.
	* The walls are blackened with centuries of smoke, obscuring some lovely frescoes illustrating scenes from the Tales of Larel One-Eye (books).
	* A circular bronze fixture hangs from the ceiling, dented from being used for target practice.
		* Unknown to the goblins, coiled around the pendant rod is an enchanted bullwhip, the whip of persuasion (new).
	* Twenty piles of furs and rags occupy the floor of the chamber. 
		* Each pile of bedding conceals 2-24 sp, with 15% chance of a gem (10-60 gp).

20 goblins, of whom at least 10 are present at any given moment: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 5(x3), 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

### SL4-9. More Rope Bridges

* Two more 4’-wide rope-and-slat bridges connect various sections of the upper hall.
	* Like the bridge at SL4-7, these are meant for goblins, not heavier beings (chances of falling as SL4-7).
	* The goblins at SL4-14a can detach their end of the rope bridge in one round.

### SL4-10. Forgotten Chamber

* This former storage room is accessed via the secret door on the wall of SL4-5.
	* It is unknown to the goblins.
* Inside are scores of items dating to the Archontean period.
	* Much is practical: shovels, prybars, picks, mauls, small hods for carrying stone, a pyramid of empty barrels, a wheelbarrow, a dozen coils of silk rope, some well-seasoned lumber (sixty 1”x12”x60” planks, 10 gp each to any underground faction), three large area carpets, six prayer rugs (3’x4’), a box full of twenty 4”-diameter steel spheres, surveying equipment, and so forth.
		* Two of the prayer rugs are enchanted (a paired rug of instant access, new).
	* Uncommon: a cache of five red spinels (100 gp each) glued to the inside of one of the empty barrels, a medium-sized suit of imperial field plate (av items), three imperial gladii, a heavy crossbow, and an Alexia’s useful pole (new).
* Secret Door (from SL4-5): opens by sliding a 4’-square panel to the left.
* Secret Door (into SL4-10): easy to find (1 in 4), and opens by pushing it inward.

### SL4-11. Tunnel with Pit

* This narrow tunnel contains a 20’-deep pit concealed by a wicker lid covered with dirt and stone chips.
	* 150+ lb of weight has a 50% chance of plunging through the wicker cover.
	* The pit is 5’x5’ at the top, but widens into a 15’x15’ cave.
		* Inside the pit the goblins keep a mangy, half-starved bear.  Those crossing the wicker pit may (10%) hear its growls.
		* The floor of the pit-cave is littered with animal and goblin bones. Amid the debris is some treasure that the goblins are too scared to fetch: 32 gp, 173 sp, and a shrunken head (new).
* Six goblins crouch at their duty post, a niche 5’ up the north wall. 
	* If combat breaks out at SL4-2, the goblins will hoot and cry, attempting to lure enemies down the tunnel and across the pit.
	* If peaceful folk pass this way, the goblins wait to see if the rubes managed to fall into the pit, provoking peals of laughter from the goblins.
		* They may (50%) move to assist unfortunates by pulling them from the pit.
	* Those who detect or avoid the pit are greeted good-naturedly by the goblins.

6 goblin bear-wranglers: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

### SL4-12. Goblin Witch Doctors

* Initial Situation
	* A stench of sulfur and boiling flesh wafts through the door.
	* Guttural chanting from figures huddled around a pentagram echoes into the hallway. 
	* Four goblin witch doctors are attempting to summon a new dretch servant, since their most recent - the much-lamented Smiley - has just been slain.
	* 25% chance the summoning goes awry as visitors approach.
		* 2-8 dretches (1-4) or a babau (5-6) are summoned and attack all in sight including those in the hallway (66%).
		* The witch doctors flee their chamber andseeking assistance from any passersby.
* Subsequent Visits
	* The witch doctors are entertaining themselves with audible glamer to cause their gallery of masks to speak and sing in funny voices.
* The witch doctors assume their friend and colleague, Larakim, is dead, since no word has come from his expedition.
	* He and his companions are trapped in 3-130.
	* If freed, he is here, and the witchdoctors will prove valuable allies to his rescuers. 

* The door to this chamber is stuck open.
* In the center of the room is a 1”-wide pentagram carefully inscribed in the floor
	* It is filled with blood and lit by candelabras at the points.
* More than a dozen distorted, elongated masks hang on the north wall
	* Eerily lit by the candelabras and a merrily burning fire to the east. 
	* The ‘masks’ are harvested and preserved dretch faces, stretched into bizarre and unnatural positions by the witch doctors’s ‘preservation’ methods.
		* The witch doctors think this is great fun, giving them silly nicknames.
		* One named “Bruno” has a small purse stuffed in its mouth.
			* 57 ancient gold solidi, a white glass activation square.
* To the east is a fire of mushroom and wood fragments.
	* A large kettle bubbles, boiling away the flesh of Smiley the dretch - save for his face, shortly to be mounted on the north wall. 
	* The witch doctors like to summon dretches as servants in their shrine (SL4-15), then slaughter them and harvesting their faces for their gallery. 
* Sleeping furs lie in the northeast corner, as does a locked wooden chest. 
	* Chest
		* A short codex written in goblin, entitled The Highly Impressive Story of Frigg the Fabulous (books).

	* Chance of encounters: 1 in 4 per turn.
		* Use the Goblin Goals table (in Random Encounters for this level) to determine what the goblins are doing.

### SL4-14. Hall of Eleven Pillars

* This darkened hall has 11 heavy, squat pillars (5’ in diameter) supporting a 20’-tall ceiling.
	* Each of the nine pillars in the main hall has a 1’-square silver, inset plaque with a Mithric numeral inscribed in lapis (from I to IX).
	* Standing by each pillar is a goblin zombie (raised by a passing Set cleric who owed Weskenim a favor).
		* They ignore non-goblins passing through, but defend themselves and intercept those approaching the shrine (SL4-15).
		* Any noise here brings the goblins from SL4-14a to investigate. 
	* The central pillar contains a secret compartment unknown to the goblins.
		* Opens to a finger’s-width catch at the base of the pillar.
		* The compartment is just large enough for the Codex Sequentis (books).
			* If Kel Bormol is released from prison (see SL3-2a), he will recover the Codex within one month of his release.
	* The chamber also contains an overlook into the great hall (SL4-14a).
	* The walls are coated in black paint with crude silver sketches of ten goblin heroes.

* Puzzle: Touching the silver, numbered plaques on the nine pillars affects the thaumaturgic circle in area SL4-15 (different patterns produce different effects).
	* Two score patterns are recorded in the Codex Sequentis.
		* Patterns using all nine numbers act as summoning spells
		* Adumbrated patterns affect the functioning of the thaumaturgic circle.
	* As numbers are touched in sequence, a cloud of harmless, effervescent purple vapor appears, extending to each new plaque until a grid of vapor covers the area.
		* When the final plaque is connected, a low grinding sound is heard from all nine pillars, and the appropriate result is effected at SL4-15.
		* Touching a plaque out of sequence causes no vapor and aborts the sequence.

11 (goblin) zombies: SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 14, 14, 13, 13, 11, 10(x3), 9, 8, 7; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special: always strike last.

##### SL4-14a: Overlook

* This extension of the Hall of Eleven Pillars provides an excellent view of the Great Hall.
	* Two ballistae mounted on swivels are served by a crew of eight goblins at all times.
		* It takes a minimum of two goblins to maneuver, fire and load a ballista (1 shot / 4 rounds) damage (2d6, 3d6 vs Large).  4 goblins can fire (1 shot / 2 rounds).
		* The goblins have 20 bolts for the two ballistae.
		* A bucket of sulfurous purple wax sits next to each ballista (see SL4-15).
			* The goblins dip each bolt in the wax before firing (save vs paralysis or be paralyzed for 1-3 turns).
	* The rope bridge to SL4-14a can easily be detached from its mountings.

8 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (spears) and 2-5 (slings).

### SL4-15: Shrine of Rizzit

* This chamber exudes an overwhelming odor of sulfur and a strong aura of evil.
	* The walls are painted an incongruously cheerful, peeling sky blue, and the floor is sheathed in elaborate colored marble triangles in geometric and figural patterns.
* A 15’-diameter thaumaturgic circle occupies the east end of the chamber.
	* The circle is of crimson, navy, and puce-green triangles, with nine 1’-diameter black circles interspersed at regular intervals along the circumference of the circle.
		* Each black circle has a Mithric numeral in lapis inside it (from I to IX).
	* Steaming and dripping inside the circle is the source of the sulfur, a horrific lucern demon named Rizzit (new).
* The south edge of the chamber features a large abacus and several stools.
	* The witch doctors use it to make calculations concerning Rizzit’s prophecies.
* To the north are two stone chests and two scrapers attached to wooden poles.
	* Chests #1: six live rats, used to feed Rizzit.
	* Chest #2: 37 mummified paws and hands of various creatures, traded to Rizzit for information.

Rizzit
* Rizzit’s form is constantly mutating, but generally appears as a floppy bipedal pile of dripping purple wax.  His head has two large black eyes and the hint of a mouth.
	* The mouth occasionally slides open, revealing chitinous, hollow, conical ‘teeth’.
	* An occasional lump of ‘wax’ drips from Rizzit’s form.  Whenit lands outside the circle, the goblins carefully scrape it up for their paralytic poison.
* Rizzit has been imprisoned for over a millennium.  His summoner, Kel Bormol (see SL3-2a), has never died, thus Rizzit’s bonds are still intact.
	* The goblins see him as a quasi-deity to be placated and occasionally consulted.
	* The witch doctors and King Weskenim know the nature of Rizzit, and have instituted strict rules to ensure that no goblin unwittingly releases Rizzit.
	* The witch doctors know the circle is connected magically to the Hall of Eleven Pillars, but don't fully understand the ancient mechanisms of this area. They don’t really care so long as they are able to collect the occasional paralytic wax and trade witticisms and information with Rizzit. 
* Rizzit tries hard to get newcomers to release him.
	* Given the length of his imprisonment, he is willing to talk, provided proper nourishment and payment (from the two chests) are offered.
	* He can make prophecies of future events, pronounced as arithmetical expressions.
		* Those ending in odd numbers equate to ‘yes’ answers; those ending in even numbers are ‘no’ answers.
	* If released without being formally bound by oaths or magic, Rizzit will wreak devastation on the goblins and any others nearby, before returning to the Abyss.
	* Should Kel Bormol be released, he will eventually come here (within a month), dispel Rizzit, and recover the Codex Sequentis (SL4-14, books).
* The thaumaturgic circle may be manipulated and altered by the pillars in SL4-14.

## Sub-Level 4: 16 - 30

### SL4-16: Store Room

* This dusty chamber is filled with boxes, crates, and bits of discarded equipment.
	* The goblins use this room as a dumping ground for spare things.
		* There is nothing of true value, but 25% any specific item of general equipment (not weapons) can be found after 2-6 turns of searching
		* Sarching randomly for 2 turns turns up an item off that list.
	* Due to its proximity to Rizzit, many of the goblins consider the room haunted.

### SL4-17: Barracks

* A cohort of 30 goblin warriors dwells in this chamber, 10 present at any given time.
	* The chamber is utterly nondescript, containing bedrolls, a water barrel, a cookfire, some fuel, and a pair of rotting mummified beastmen used for weapons practice.
		* Each bedroll has 3-18 sp concealed in it.

10 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 5(x3), 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (short sword) and 2-7 (military pick).

	* Two large ballistae are mounted here, served by a crew of eight goblin warriors.
	* A bucket of purple wax (see SL4-15) and a rack of ten bolts rests next to each ballista.
		* It takes a minimum of two goblins to maneuver, fire and load a ballista (rate of fire 1 per 4 rounds, damage is 2-12 / 3-18 per bolt).
		* If 4 goblins serve a ballista, the rate of fire is 1 bolt per 2 rounds.

8 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 6, 5(x3), 4, 4, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (spear).

	* 3-18 sp in each bedroll

10 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 5(x3), 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8 (morning star).

##### SL4-18a: Overlook

### SL4-19: Sir Sorrow, the Sun-Scarred Knight

* King Weskenim handed over his only guest chamber to Sorrow, one of the Sun-Scarred Knights, when she arrived in the Goblin Warrens eleven months ago.
	* By her request and expense, the chamber has been redecorated to her liking.
* Each wall is light blue and features the same image: a puffy, white cloud from behind which a handful of solar rays emerge.
	* Sorrow’s furnishings include a wooden bed-frame with an overstuffed feather mattress, a pair of leather easy chairs, a low wooden table, a beautiful mahogany armoire, a locked stone chest, and a desk and chair made out of bone. 
		* Stone Chest (locked): 9,875 sp; 1,129 gp; a djed amulet (new); 3 doses of incense of attraction (new); Sorrow’s vial of tears (new).
		* Desk: an ivory and bronze statuette of a dancing houri (250 gp); a slim manuscript of high-quality original poetry (250 gp) by Sorrow herself "A Lover’s Lament" (the title page attributes the work to Aelia of Perros – for her, see Green are My Lover’s Eyes in Arden Vul books). 
			* A letter in progress reads “Discord has gone too far and is living up to his name. The Master’s motive in letting him undermine my work here is opaque. He is banished to the Knight’s Rest. More efforts to shore up the pitiful goblins are needed.” (GM Note: ‘Discord’ refers to Sir Discord, another of the Sun-Scarred Knights, currently holed up in the Knights’ Rest, i.e., 8-116)
		* Fine Armoire (100 gp): a pair of high-quality silk robes, decorated with female warriors defeating hydras (75 gp each); a red-and-yellow cap of serenity (new); a pair of thigh boots of heqeti hide (40 gp); and a feather boa (15 sp).

* Sorrow is in her chamber (50%), in SL4-23 (25%), elsewhere in the Goblin Warrens (20%), or in some completely different location (5%). 
	* Those entering unannounced or uninvited are greeted by her varlet, Huguette, who leaps to her feet to demand the reason for intrusion.
	* 20% chance Sorrow is intrigued by the visitors and allow them to remain, otherwise Huguette demands immediate exit, using persuasion, then threats, and ultimately force. Sorrow allows Huguette to conduct all negotiations unless violence breaks out, at which point she comes to the defense of her varlet.

Sir Sorrow
* A tall (6’ 2”), muscular, woman with long black hair and piercing green eyes.
* Her beauty is marred (or enhanced?) by ritual scarring on each cheek: one cheek shows a full sun, the other an arched doorway.
* Sorrow speaks Archontean easily, with a strange accent; she is also fluent in all the other major tongues of the Halls.
* Outside this room, she wears her gothic armor at all times, but may go helmet-less within the Goblin Warrens. Inside her chamber she doffs her armor for brightly colored silk trousers and tunic. 
* She is extremely adept at diplomacy, and at making those around her think that her ideas were always their own.
	* Weskenim and the goblins do not know here motives for being here.
	* Her mission is to prop up the goblins, whom the knights see as the weakest of the major factions.
	* Sorrow has been subtly advising Weskenim against costly aggression (e.g., against the Halflings), and suggesting new defensive measures and practices.
* Personal Interests
	* Manifestations of grief in all its forms, particularly the gendering of sorrow, and  comparative racial causes for sorrow (human vs. goblin, for instance).
	* She will manipulate listeners into recognizing their own grief at any number of incidents; those around her are often weeping (but not vengeful).
	* Labor and hierarchy.  She sometimes foments dissent with anti-hierarchical ideology, especially just before a mission is about to end.
	* Pretty women who sing songs of broken or unconsummated love.
* She is eager to talk to new visitors to the Goblin Warrens, but on her own terms; like all the Knights, she is adept at not revealing her own agenda.
* Sorrow will abruptly leave the Goblin Warrens 1-6 months after being first encountered here by the PCs.
	* When she departs, the chamber will be given over to another favored guest of the GM’s choice.

Huguette, Sorrow's Varlet
* Huguette is equally tall, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a fiery temper; although Archontean, she is clearly of Wiskin descent.

Sir Sorrow, the Sun-Scarred Knight (see new monsters), 11th-level female Wiskin fighter (50%): SZ M; AL LN; AC -2; MV 120’; HD 11; HP 95; #AT 3/2; Dmg 4-13 (two-handed sword

Huguette, varlet to Sir Sorrow, and a 5th-level female Archontean fighter (50%): SZ M; AL LN; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 5; HP 49; #AT 1; Dmg 6-13 (battle axe +2) or 1-6 (short bow). Abilities: STR 18/13, INT 9, WIS 15, DEX 11, CON 16, CHA 9. Possessions: chain mail +2 and medium shield; battle axe +2; short bow and 20 arrows; 2 potions of heroism.

### SL4-20: Royal Harem

* King Weskenim keeps a substantial harem in this richly appointed (by goblin standards) chamber.
	* Eunuch ogre guards are posted both inside and outside the door to SL4-23 (unless Weskenim is visiting, in which case the inside guard will be in SL4-22).
* The chamber is painted a soothing pale green, and lit by smoky wall sconces.
	* The eastern section, by the door to SL4-23, contains a pair of game tables, eight chairs, and a large comfy chair for the ogre guard.
	* A heavy tapestry hangs from the ceiling, dividing eastern and western areas.
		* Old and faded, it shows a female archon directing legionaries against a horde of heqeti (the warlike archon, Irene Bellatrix – see SL6-9 and SL6-44). 
	* The western section, where the ladies entertain King Weskenim, is filled with cushions and pillows of varying quality.
	* The entrance to SL4-21 is concealed by another hanging tapestry.
		* Old and faded, it shows a female mage floating above a subterranean lake pointing a black spear (Kentillian, wielding the famous ebon spear; see SL5-13b)
* 15 goblin women, 2 human women, and a lone grimalkin woman make up the harem.
	* They are quite content with their status, having no desire to be ‘freed’ or rescued.
	* The alpha ‘wife’ is Griselt, who governs the harem fairly but strictly. 
	* The harem ladies collectively possess 40 pieces of jewelry, which they wear at all times: 20 are silver (100-1,000 gp each), 8 are gold and silver (200-1,200 gp each), 8 are gold (300-1,800 gp each), and 2 (Griselt’s) are platinum studded with emeralds (1750 gp) each.
* If Weskenim is visiting, then 1d6 ladies will be here, while the rest wait in their living quarters (SL4-21). Otherwise 12 ladies are lounging among the pillows here.

15 goblin females: non-combatants, AC 8, 1 HP.

2 human women: non-combatants, AC 10, 2 HP.

1 halfling woman: non-combatant, AC 9, 1 HP.
* One of the Poison Claw rogues who decided this was a better gig.

1 eunuch ogre guard: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 25; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

King Weskenim (20%): see stats at SL4-22.

### SL4-21: Harem Quarters

* To the west is a small cavern excavated at the orders of King Weskenim (SL4-22) to house his burgeoning harem.
	* It contains seventeen hammocks, a trio of vanities with make-up pots, and seventeen individual locked iron boxes holding the trinkets of the harem ladies.
		* Most are mundane and valueless (bits of hair, small bits of carved rock or bone, a button or two), but each box also contains 3-18 sp and 2-12 gp.
* If Weskenim is visiting the harem (20% chance), then all but 1d6 ladies will be present here; otherwise only five of the seventeen are present, lounging in their hammocks.

For stats, see SL4-20.

### SL4-22: King Weskenim

* Weskenim, the Grand King of the United Goblins, rules his people from his throne room.
	* The eastern and western halves are separated by heavy purple curtains embroidered with crowns, scepters, and grinning goblin faces
		* The north and south walls are also painted purple, each featuring an enormous, garish, cartoony image of a grinning Weskenim. 
	* The eastern, public part of the room is dimly lit by a pair of wall-sconces and  dominated by a large, king-sized bed, from which Weskenim greets petitioners.
		* North of the bed is a bench, on which his advisors - Skimmel and Reeflik - and major-domo, Palestrim, sit while he dispenses judgments, advice, and commands.
		* A eunuch ogre guard stands sits just inside the east door at all times.
	* The western half of the room is mostly dark, with walls painted black, featuring a gilt throne lined with throw pillows and three comfortable settees.
		* Two sets of armor: one ceremonial and badly rusted (new, armor of secret storage), the other gleaming and functional (banded mail +1).
			* The rusty armor's magic is concealed by Frigg’s fraud (new), cast by the witch doctors.
			* Weskenim’s main treasure cache is within the armor of secret storage: 5,195 gp, 27,632 sp, and 50 gems (worth 50-500 gp each), including 3 flawless diamonds (5,000 gp each).
			* Only Weskenim, his advisors, and the witch doctors (SL4-12) know of the stash; and are careful to only interact with it when no one else is present.
		* A sideboard stocked with wine, an enormous keg of brandy.
		* A stout iron-bound chest for operating expenses.
			* Stacks of coins line one side (275 gp, 896 sp).
			* The other side contains a pouch (20 pearls (100 gp each), a set of 6 Archontean chess pieces in solid gold with ivory highlights (400 gp per piece; for more on Archontean chess, see 3-36c).
		* A lectern with a large volume on it (Weskenim’s ledger book).
			* A meticulous piece of double-entry bookkeeping with every bit of tribute collected by the king (from visitors, goblin clans, or any other source).
				* Casual investigation shows a list of debits and credits.
				* 1-2 hours of study and 4d6 under INT shows the running total of Weskenim’s finances is much greater than the sums found in the operating expenses chest; a clue that Weskenim must have other sources of treasure.
		* A comfortable hammock slung across the northwest corner (Weskenim’s preferred sleeping location).

* Weskenim will be found in his throne room (25%), visiting his harem in SL4-20 (20%), mingling with the courtiers in SL4-23 (25%), visiting the clans in the Great Hall at SL4-40 (25%), or occupied with some secret business (5%).

Weskenim
* Weskenim is a shrewd, canny old goblin much given to bursts of enthusiasm for interesting persons and for new projects.
* He is large for a goblin, with a shock of raven hair, large incisors, and a huge, lumpy nose.
* He favors bright, loose silks, and a brilliantly colored, although slightly tattered turban, on top of which perches his crown.
* Appearing slightly naïve and unsophisticated, Weskenim is quite intelligent and is sensitive to how he is treated.
	* The deferential and respectful are more likely to find their requests fulfilled.
	* Those who are condescending or arrogant will find themselves negotiating impenetrable walls of banal pleasantries. 
* Weskenim’s power is fairly secure, since he is popular with nearly all the family groupings that make up the tribe.
	* An exception is the group at SL4-57 which came to follow a goblin mystic named Gislu (see interests below).
* Concerns and Interests
	* Concerned about the expedition he sent to Level 3.
		* Lead by Harab and Larakim (see 3-130). He delicately questions visitors about his missing people, and is instantly favorable to those who rescue them.
	* To the amusement of his people, he has a strong fear of cavern cephalopods
		* Offers favors and gifts to any who produce a cephalopod husk.
	* Fascinated with cats.
		* Would give coin and favors for a litter of kittens or a pregnant mother.
		* GM Note: A likely source is near the temple of Bastet (8-30 to 8-50).
	* Gislu and the Goblin Sceptre
		* Gislu the goblin mystic recently announced that no goblin could be king without possessing the scepter of the goblins (new).
		* Weskenim looked around for a scepter, but couldn’t find one, and so he banished Gislu (who is now in 4-2).
		* As no one, including Weskenim, knows what this scepter looks like, Weskenim is slightly anxious about the sudden emergence of the scepter and the threat to his power that it might entail.  Weskenim and Palestrim keep a close watch on the gossip in SL4-23, listening for news of the scepter.
		* Should Gislu or anyone else show up with the scepter of the goblins (currently at 8-69), or even a plausible simulacrum (e.g., the troll flute in 3-168)...
			* Those producing a ‘scepter’ are likely to be challenged to single combat by the king, via one of his champions (one of the ogres).
			* Weskenim will pay handsomely for discrete information about the scepter or, better yet, any plausible version of that object.

Advisors
* The king is served ably by a coterie of old and trusted advisors.
	* They sleep on the settees in the throne room, near their king.
* Palestrim, the major-domo
	* Determines who gains admittance to the royal chambers, and when.
	* This grizzled, one-legged goblin is particularly adept at reading the motives of non-goblins, and is thus usually present for all interviews inside the throne room.
* Skimmel, an aged goblin with stringy white hair
	* Referred to by the king as ‘Caution’ for his reminders about the potential costs of actions in terms of treasure, manpower, and other resources. 
* Reeflik, a younger goblin (actually middle-aged)
	* The king calls him ‘the Hammer’, always keen to use force to defend and extend goblin influence.
* Despite their contrasting roles, Skimmel and Reeflik are the best of friends.

### SL4-23: Court of the Goblin King

* This broad plaza, with its overlook into SL4-5, serves as the main site for goblin politics.
	* The north and south walls feature a stone bench, on which the more elderly or pessimistic courtiers rest.
	* Two braziers in the chamber's center casts a dull glow and provides some warmth.
	* When not in the throne room (SL4-22), Palestrim, the major-domo of the court, sits on a too-large padded chair just outside the door to the throne room. 
* Important goblins and visitors mill about, sharing gossip, hatching plans, and generally feeling important.
	* All await Weskenim’s frequent appearances, he loves nothing more than to press the flesh, display his prodigious incisors, and utter pithy-but-vague platitudes.
	* Violence is not permitted, by order of the king, and transgressors are met with immediate resistance from all those in attendance.
	* The court is a hotbed of gossip and rumor; mostly mundane and salacious, but there are a few dangerous political undercurrents that occasional surface.
		* One involves the touchy subject of the scepter of the goblins (new, see 8-69 and SL4-22). Visitors may well be questioned on the sly about this object and its location; careless responses can cause serious political repercussions, and might even bring an immediate interview with Weskenim.

Palestrim
* Palestrim’s job is to decide who may enter the royal chambers and in what order.
* An old, grizzled, and one-legged goblin, he is quite adept at his job, for he has a natural and somewhat mystical ability to read the motives of non-goblins.
	* Those unknown to the court may expect up to a week's wait before being admitted.
	* Known ‘Goblin Friends,’ are usually be admitted within 12 hours.
* Palestrim is not particularly venal, but appreciates fine food and drink.

* Weskenim loves to make appearances and shout encouraging slogans from this overlook.
* Two brass speaking tubes located on either side of the royal podium loudly project any voice into SL4-5.

### SL4-24: Royal Guards

* The elite royal goblin guards inhabit this chamber.
	* 22 goblins in three companies of 6, plus 3 captains and a commander.
	* The royal guards wear jaunty, bright red silk caps and their scarlet oval badge (with a silver-incised image of Weskenim on it).
	* The captains accompany their companies at all times, but the commander, Vingrim the Surly, is lazy, and spends 90% of his time lounging around the brazier.

### SL4-25: Lair of the Eunuch Ogres

* Weskenim purchases young ogres from the troll thegn, castrates them, and raises them as his private bodyguards.
	* Eight reside here, four off on guard at any moment, and four here.
	* The ogres are delighted with their mostly ceremonial position and cushy lair, and would never betray Weskenim.

	* The tunnel leading west (SL4-27a) is covered by a thick net of woven rope to prevent unwanted visitors from below from accessing the Warrens.

##### SL4-27a: Connecting Tunnel

* This exploratory tunnel was begun several hundred years ago and, to the goblins’ delight, was found to connect to a valuable source of food.
	* 25% chance that 1d3+3 goblins are crouching at the western edge of the tunnel overlooking the shaft (SL4-28).
* A woven rope-and-slat bridge extends over the chasm to SL4-29, allowing access to the largest mushroom shelf. 

4-6 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. They also have short bows with arrows (ropes attached to the arrows) and ‘pickers’ (See SL4-27).

### SL4-28: Vertical Shaft, leading down to 6-112

* This cavern formed three millennia ago as a burn hole when the crew quarters module of the Beacon (6-112) plunged downward through the cliff.
	* The upper reaches of the shaft were sealed by seismic activity, a long section still remains, extending 475’ feet from the Goblin Warrens to 6-112. 
	* Ledges and shelves dot the shaft, each containing a thick grove of giant mushrooms.
		* Some are detailed (SL4-29, SL4-30, SL4-61 to SL4-63), not all.
	* The shaft houses a many small lizards, which the goblins hunt with bows and arrows. 

### SL4-29: Mushroom Shelf

* This is the largest of the shelves that dot the vertical shaft (SL4-28).
	* A rope-and-slats ladder connects this shelf to area SL4-27a.
	* The goblins carefully cultivate this patch of mushrooms, and it provides quality eating from its white ribs and cloud caps (flora). 

### SL4-30: Mushroom Shelf

* This narrow shelf is harder for the goblins to access, and as a result they rarely visit it.
	* Among the cloud caps and white ribs are 8 aqua vitae mushrooms (see flora for all).
	* Buried in the mulch: a plasteel box of six Arden Vul cakes (av items) and a rudishva fire extinguisher (tech).

## Sub-Level 4: 31 - 45 (Lower)

### SL4-31: Blocked Tunnel, eventually leading to SL5-24

* Although this tunnel is currently impassable, the prisoners in area SL4-32 are busily excavating it.
	* Within 1-3 weeks it will be cleared enough to allow passage down to SL5-24.

### SL4-32: Cave with Tunnel

* The goblins are trying to expand their domains by digging in this area.
	* Five prisoners, shackled together at the feet by a thick chain, are using pickaxes and mattocks to try to expand the cave.
	* They are watched by a trio of goblin guards.
* The prisoners reside here during rest periods; the goblins attach their chain to a staple in the wall, and the prisoners sleep on the rocky floor.
	* Once SL4-31 is fully cleared, Weskenim will have this area improved as a guard area.

### SL4-33: Interrogation Chamber

* Agoravere, the official goblin interrogator, operates in this chamber just off the Judgment Hall (SL4-34).
	* The finished walls were long ago stripped of decoration.
	* Agoravere has his living space in the eastern fragment of corridor.
		* Agoravere keeps a bag of holding (largest size) tucked into his bed-clothes.
			* Inside: 26 gp, 68 sp, 128 cp, his father’s silver razor (25 gp), a wax-sealed cheddar he’s keeping for a special occasion (it went off a long time ago), 6 iron flasks containing his urine, a large moss agate (50 gp), a mink pelt (3 gp), a pouch filled with pulled-off fingernails, a long coil of thin gold wire (65 gp), a dried badger penis, two ivory dice pipped with obsidian (50 gp), a bundle of twine-bound twigs containing a wand of wonder (34 charges).

	* Three low tables fitted with restraints occupy the center of the room.
		* A fine collection of razor-sharp knives and other tools is laid out.
	* Three sets of shackles have been attached to the western wall.
		* One of them holds Elena, a paladin.
		* Another holds the near-dead body of Carloman Fleetfingers (formerly second in command to Phlebotomas Plumthorn (see 3-5) but captured on a raid) 
			* Returning him to Plumthorn wins the grudging friendship of the halflings.

### SL4-34: Judgment Hall and Lesser Obsidian Gates

* The arch from the Great Hall (SL4-40) leads to this smoky, 20’ chamber.
	* A pair of 15’-tall, 10’-wide obsidian doors looms along the western wall.
	* Centuries of smoke and grime have completely effaced the frescoes on the north and south walls.
		* If restored, they show Thothian priests directing construction workers.
	* Four cages which hang from thick chains in each corner.
		* Perrilk, a son of the lizardman king
		* Narbo, a magic user captured by the goblins
		* A heqeti
		* Purbrin, Weskenim’s rebellious half-brother.

		* A beastman deserter
		* A sobbing merchant from Narsileon
	* Young goblins like to hang around, mocking the prisoners and hurling trash at them.
	* A pair of guards is stationed at both north and south exits from the Judgment Hall.

Lesser Obsidian Gates
* These were made by the Archonteans in homage to the original Obsidian Gates.
* They are carved with arcane symbols of Thoth, Set, and the Imperial Cult (the gold fill was stripped long ago).
* Strongly enchanted to repel and suppress magic.
	* Spell cast by less than a 12th-level caster are dispelled.
	* 5% chance that magic items brought within 10’ gates are disenchanted.
* The gates have not been opened in well over a thousand years.
	* They feature an extremely complex lock:
		* Four obsidian posts protrude from the doors at eye level, two on each of the double doors, exactly 8” apart.  Subtle steel needles extending 1/8” above the surface of the door.
	* The doors open only by placing four golden, grooved disks on the posts and rotating them in the proper direction against the steel needles (like a vinyl record album).
		* Clockwise from the upper left post, the disks must be spun in the following ways: 1) a full rotation counter-clockwise; 2) a half rotation clockwise; 3) two rotations clockwise; and 4) a full rotation clockwise and then a full rotation counter-clockwise.
		* Suitable discs: SL4-48 (the goblins consider  it taboo), 3-63, 5-85, and SL4-46. 
* The goblins are simultaneously proud of the gates and afraid of what lies behind them.
	* They present the gates as a great work of their ancestors, but have no idea how to open them.

### SL4-35: Statuary Corridor

* This broad, 15’-tall corridor contains four 6’-tall, bronze statues of laborers (a goblin wielding a hammer and chisel, two humans wielding pick-axes, a human employing mason’s tools).
	* Idealized, but well-executed.
	* The goblin statue could be ‘sold’ to King Weskenim (SL4-22) for 500 gp and substantial goodwill
	* All four statues could be sold outside the Halls (750 gp each).
* From the western side, the lesser obsidian gates (see SL4-34) may be opened with ease, and without recourse to the complicated locking mechanism found on the eastern side.

### SL4-36: Archontean Guard Post

* This former guard post features still-vibrant frescoes depicting Archontean guardsmen watching over laborers who are excavating and shaping stone.
	* The chamber contains a circular wooden table and six stools
	* A rare suit of imperial field plate (av items) hangs on a rack by the door.

### SL4-37: Hidden Stairs to the Surface (AV-16)

* A lost Archontean ‘back route’ to the surface of the ruined city.
	* These stairs wind up numerous landings and short corridors for 725’, emerging in a currently-buried cellar in the ruins (AV-16).
	* If this route is opened, the goblins quickly move to seize control of the stairs, providing them access to the surface and a major supply of food and trade opportunities.

### SL4-38: Kitchens

* The stench of meat and entrails emanates from this chamber, where a team of goblins prepares food to be cooked on the great fire (SL4-40a).
	* Any former decorations are long gone, and the walls drip with grease and dust.
	* Two 12’-long, 4’-wide trestle tables occupy the northern half of the room.
		* Around them caper six goblin chefs, chopping and dicing meats with cleavers much too big for them.
	* A third table is the site of baking and vegetable preparation.
	* A ceramic stove occupies the eastern edge of the finished chamber
	* A curtain to the south obscures entry to SL4-39.
	* The chefs’s sleeping quarters are in the western corridor fragment.
* The chefs cook for the goblin elites (the inhabitants of SL4-12 and SL4-19 to SL4-25).
	* A stream of servers is often darting out of this room for the upper level.
	* Many of the clans also commission the chefs to prepare their meals, especially when hunting has been good. As a result, the chefs are busy almost all the time.

10 goblin chefs, armed with cleavers and spoons: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 5(x3), 4, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

### SL4-39: Supply Cave

* This two-lobed cave serves as the main food storage site.
	* Western lobe: filled with rickety shelves and dangling sides of curing meat.
		* Almost any food item can be found, fresh, dried, or preserved, among the litter.
			* 20% chance a given item has spoiled (food poisoning: -3 to all attributes for two days, halved movement).
	* Eastern lobe: chilled (40 F) by a pair of cold rocks (new) enchanted decades ago by a friendly magic user in return for lodging
		* The goblins are unsure what to bother refrigerating, so the area is less cluttered, but visitors to the Halls often require their food be stored here.
		* A selection of fresh-ish meats, some unattractive but nourishing pies, and three casks of excellent wine (100 gp each).
		* Two barrels just inside the cold zone are the cleaning facility for the kitchens.
			* Hidden under a cleaning barrel is a pouch (14 gp, a small, but flawless, ruby, 1,000 gp).

### SL4-40: Lower Great Hall

* The lower Great Hall is a hive of activity, noise, and motion. 
	* The great frescoes (see SL4-5) are gone, but the magnificent craftsmanship of the Hall, archways, fountain, and plinth, is still apparent, despite the ravages of time.
	* A large colony of hundreds of small (3”-long) white lizards shares the Hall with the goblins, who use them for the occasional snack.  They scamper brazenly over almost every portion of the Hall (save the fire pit at SL4-40a and statute at SL4-40d).
	* A flock of 30 goats roams the halls; each marked with a spot of paint to designate which clan owns it. Poaching goats is a serious offense! 
* The goblins use the floor of the Hall for many activities (cooking, socializing, training with weapons, trading with visitors, etc.).
	* Approved visitors (see SL4-4) will be directed down the great ladder (SL4-6) and told to join the throng on the floor of the Great Hall.
		* The goblins love watching big visitors negotiate the tricky bridges (SL4-9), and tend to ‘forget’ to tell them about the circular stair (SL4-13).
		* Visitors are expected to pitch camp somewhere on the floor and at their own risk, though valuables may be stored with Leifcrim for a price (see SL4-40f).
	* A pair of eunuch ogres help keep the peace (SL4-40g), mostly sitting around lazily.

* At any given moment the following persons will be present in the Great Hall (in addition to inhabitants mentioned in the sub-regions of the Hall):
	* 40 goblins engaged in sundry mundane activities: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7(x6), 6(7), 5(x7), 4(x7), 3(x7), 2(x6); #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

##### SL4-40a: Firepit

* One of the three main features of the lower Hall, this massive firepit serves as the main source of light and heat for the Hall.
	* Originally a 10’ circle was cut into the floor of the Hall and a lesser fire elemental bound by ancient wizards, but the firepit now sprawls over a wider area.
		* At the core is the same fire elemental, but the goblins like burning things when they can, and the elemental has been obscured by a huge pile of charcoal, on top of which wood, trash, bones, and anything else is tossed. 
	* Weskenim’s decreed that any goblin may use the firepit for cooking
		* There are always 3-12 goblins roasting some sort of meat on sticks.
		* Of these, 25% are actual chefs, hireable by the wealth to prepare ‘special’ meals (in addition to their duties as cooks to the king and other elites).

3-12 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 7, 6, 6, 5(x3), 4(x3), 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

1 fire elemental: SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 51; #AT 1; Dmg 3-24. Special attacks: combustion. Special defenses: +2 weapons or better to hit.

##### SL4-40b: Goat Pen

* This corner of the hall is enclosed by an iron cage set into the stone walls.
	* Inside are 15 goats, bleating loudly.
		* These are the goats with disputed ownership. Until that fact can be sorted out, they are stuck inside this pen.

15 goats: SZ M; AL N; AC 7, MV 150’; HD 1+2; HP 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5(x3), 4(x3), 3, 3, 2, 2; #AT 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: charge.

##### SL4-40c: Beetle Pen

* This pen contains ten hungry giant fire beetles.
	* Weskenim had the idea to breed them after his scouts caught a few.
	* The goblins are a bit intimidated by the beetles, and would listen to offers concerning their sale or use.

10 fire beetles: SZ S; AL N; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 1+2; HP 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8.

##### SL4-40d: Old Plinth and New Statue

* In the center of the Hall is an ancient, 3’-tall circular plinth of pink marble.
	* On top is a statue obviously much newer than the plinth, carved of simple granite.
	* A 6’-tall, male human dressed in chain mail and a velvet cowl, gesturing to his right with a 3’ baton.
		* This is Julianus the Red, a Sortian, petrified in antiquity by a basilisk (might be mistaken for a modern Priscian war-mage if you've seen one).
* Goblins found the ‘statue’, brought it back to the Great Hall, and installed in on the plinth.
	* The ordinary goblins love ‘the Pointer’ and often dress him up in dramatic, flowery, goblin-style clothing.
	* He has even been painted several times, although Weskenim always commands him to be restored to ‘stony perfection’ after a couple of weeks.
	* The Priscian ambassadors (SL4-44) heard of the statue from Palestrim, and want to remove him without causing a ruckusl this is proving more difficult than expected.
	* If restored, he'll be grateful.  He won't be impressed with modern Priscian ideology.

Julianus the Red, a Sortian from antiquity, as a 7th-level Archontean magic user: SZ M; AL LN; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 21; #AT 1; Dmg 3-5 (darts +2). Abilities: STR 11, INT 17, WIS

Julianus has no memorized spells, and his spell book is long gone; he speaks Mithric and an ancient dialect of Thorcin.

##### SL4-40e: Fountain

* This large fountain and pool dominates the east side of the Hall. 
	* The fountain is powered by a small water elemental bound to a chamber 10’ below the floor of the Hall.
	* The pool around the fountain is 3’ above the floor of the Hall and contains cool, clean water.

1 half-sized water elemental: SZ S; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’, 180’ in water; HD 4; HP 26; #AT 1; Dmg 2-20. Special attacks: affect boats. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit.

##### SL4-40f: Merchants’ Corner

* This corner of the Hall is devoted to trade and barter with outsiders.
	* The overseer is Master Leifcrim, a grimalkin merchant.
		* He licenses traders (10 gp for a month) and provides them a rickety table under the awning at which they may hawk their wares.
		* Leifcrim operates his own trading concern from a beautiful ebon-wood desk next to the door to SL4-47.
	* The current traders present here are listed below.
		* Most have only a limited sample of their wares on the table, and prefer to negotiate with customers before visiting SL4-47 to procure a specific item that the customer desires.

Master Leifcrim 
* Personality: Outgoing, enthusiastic, easy-going
* Secret? A close ally of King Weskenim (SL4-22); reports to king every other day.

Leifcrim, 5th-level male halfling thief: SZ S; AL LN; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 5; HP 24; #AT 1; Dmg 4-7 (dagger +3). Abilities: STR 10, INT 14, WIS 11, DEX 17, CON 11, CHA 12. Thief skills: PP

He has 3 vials of Mortality poison (see 3-4) as well, which he will only sell to trusted customers (at 125 gp per vial).

Jobim, goblin brewer: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 4; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. 

Temrin the Artist 
* Personality: Eager, puppy-like, easily tricked
* Secret? Can limn magical maps. If an object is described to him, he has the supernatural ability to sketch a quick map from area SL4-40 to that location. The map does not include secret doors or side areas; it depicts the main route to the desired object. Specific details of the object are necessary for the map to be accurate (i.e., one cannot ask him to locate ‘big treasure’; one must describe an object in size, shape, color, etc.). He might reveal this information to someone who commissions at least one portrait and who praises the quality of his work. He will ask 500 gp per magical map although they are easily worth three times that sum.
* Lockbox: 64 gp, 156 sp
* Might Buy: Nothing. He’s a painter, and is desperate for customers.
* Goods for Sale: Returning from a visit to Narsileon, Temrin is attempting to interest his fellows in portraiture, with little success.

Temrin, goblin artist: SZ S; AL LN; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 4; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. 

Thorgrim the Easy 
* Personality: His nickname, ‘easy’, is a joke, as Thorgrim is dour, short-tempered, and irascible
* Secret? He’s looking for the iron circlet of Ghanor (see new magic items; currently located at 3-127A)
* Lockbox: 439 gp, 197 sp
* Might Buy: Old Archontean artifacts, particularly books, maps, and other hints as to the iron circlet’s location

Claudine of Narsileon, a Set Deacon, as a 6th-level female Archontean cleric of Set: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6, HP 40; #AT 1; Dmg: 3-8 (mace +1). Abilities: STR 13; INT 15; WIS

GM Note
* The adventurers are searching for specimens of the rare midnight rose flower (flora).
	* They got in a verbal argument with the goblins concerning the treatment of their animals (e.g., the giant badgers at SL4-50), and so the goblins arrested them.
	* Weskenim (SL4-22) is trying to decide what to do about the visitors. 

* They are elves, recently from the Burdock Valley fastness, seeking botanical marvels from the Halls.
	* They know/are known to Primal Vengeance, but aren't members.

### SL4-42: Barracks of the Great Army

* This cave is accessed by a narrow ladder leading up 15’ from the floor of the Great Hall.
	* The 20’-high, unlit cavern is spacious and floored with sand.
	* Sleeping mats are dotted around, and dozens of hammocks are slung throughout.
		* Each bed conceals 3-18 sp.
	* 16 half-barrels stand by, 8 used for waste and 8 for water.
	* A rickety, 12’-tall wooden ladder leans against the western wall.
		* A mat of goat-hide covers an 8’-diameter hole in the floor near the ladder; hard to spot in the dark (as concealed door).  A hammock above it further  obscures sight.
			* The hole leads down to SL4-43. The goblins all know of it, but have strict orders from Weskenim (SL4-22) not to venture below.  All they say is some humans were discovered below and that Palestrim (SL4-23), the king’s major-domo, travels below for long periods of time.

		* Although looted, it rests over (and obscures from casual view) a magical spear +2 named Bright-Blade (new).

### SL4-44: Priscian Embassy

* A triad of Priscian war mages inhabits this chamber.
	* The triad was sent by Jaracondus the Sprightly (9-63) to investigate the passage at 7-44A; their exploration led to SL4-45 and the goblins.
	* Initially surprised, the Priscians quickly established new short-term goals.
		* From Palestrim, the king’s major domo, they heard of the statue (SL4-40) and floating head (SL4-58), recognizing them as Sortian, they are scheming to recover both.
	* Hoping to use persuasion (or else magic), to enlist King Weskenim (SL4-22) as an ally against the troll thegn (7-30).
		* They have yet to meet the king, as he is afraid of the thegn and has ordered the Priscians to remain here, out of sight.
		* They have been negotiating instead with Palestrim (SL4-23) for over a month, and are starting to grow irritated by the slow pace of discussions. 
* Weskenim has appointed the chamber richly, as befits the importance of the visitors.
	* Three costly rugs cover the floor (2x 50 gp, and an ancient one depicting a dragon-riding Archontean, 300 gp).
	* The walls are painted a cool shade of light blue.
	* Three wooden beds, three desks, six chairs, a low table, and two locked chests complete the chamber.

### SL4-47. Merchants’ Storage

* The wooden door to this chamber is in excellent repair and remains locked at all times. 
	* Master Leifcrim (SL4-40f) holds the only key. 
* Inside is an old storeroom which Leifcrim uses as a storehouse.
	* He holds goods of his own, other merchants, certain items for Weskenim, and the valuables of visitors.
		* Visitors are charged 1 gp/day to store small parcels, and 10 gp/day for larger packages or items.
		* Leifcrim is honest, and goods stored here should be safe. 
	* Seven lockable wooden chests, four currently in use by the merchants in SL4-32f (only Temrin does not use one).
		* These chests hold the goods mentioned as ‘For Sale’ in the merchant writeups.
	* Larger goods that do not fit within the chests (e.g. weapons and armor) are stacked neatly near the appropriate merchant’s chest.
		* Incongruous among the valuables is a small set of shelves containing fifteen pots of paint in various colors and a number of decrepit paint brushes.
	* Weskenim has stored some bulky valuables here.
		* 5 rolled-up carpets (2x 75 gp, 1x 125 gp, 2x 475 gp spectacular examples of old Archontean carpet-weaving); a defaced marble bust of a bald Archontean, with the Mithric inscription ‘Trebizet the Overseer’ (see SL4-48); 6 ceremonial spears covered in gold leaf (50 gp each); a pair of 5’-tall Archontean urns with images of laborers with picks and shovels (100 gp each); and a large tapestry showing scenes from the Song of Jacinth the Rose (books, 1,125 gp).
	* Currently no other visitors have taken advantage of Leifcrim’s storage services.

### SL4-48: Taboo Chamber

* The door to this chamber is emblazoned (Goblin) with faded, ancient graffiti.
	* A skull and crossbones with the word “NO!” next to it, “Death lies within!”, and “No Entry! The overseer still lives ... sort of!”
	* The door is locked (key lost) and stuck.
	* The modern goblins who recently discovered this chamber (via the hole from SL4-42 to SL4-43) have been fully intimidated by the ancient words of their ancestors, and refused to investigate or enter this chamber.
* The chamber is brightly painted.
	* Huge frescos dominate the north, south, and east walls.
		* North: a pair of night-black doorways on which glow mystical symbols of Thoth, Set, and Archontos.
			* Priests flank the doors, one robed in orange, the other red, each holding a grooved, golden disk and pointing to the doors.
			* GM: hints at the operation of the lesser Obsidian Gates at SL4-34).
		* South: a huge eye looming over scores of miniscule laboring figures.
		* East: a pastoral scene of surprising beauty and unusual draftsmanship.
			* More lush and painterly, with vivid, bright hues, almost impressionistic style, rather than the usual Egyptian-style frescoes.
			* A rolling hill, a sunken country lane, and two giant elm trees.  In the distance, a hazy smudge might be a fortified manor house.  In the foreground is a knotted walking stick thrust into the bank of the lane.
				* The image is gate into faerie.  Grasping the walking stick pulls you  into the painting and the world of faerie (details up to the GM).
	* A large table (12’ square), on which are scattered a number of old parchment documents.
		* Documents: Most are mundane bureaucratic memoranda (guard rotations, lists of laborers, accounts, etc.; 30 gp to a collector).
			* One is an illuminated version of the Lay of Marius Invictus (books).
		* Benches and chairs flank the table.
		* In the largest chair, directly across from the entrance, is slumped a corpse.
			* Poisoned dagger embedded in its back.
			* 24 ancient silver pennies, 6 ancient gold solidi; a silver and jasper ring (150 gp); boots of jumping.
		* Attached to the underside in its exact center is a 3’-diameter circular metal container (locked, poison needle).
	* Along the south wall are three open 4’x4’x4’ stone bins.
		* Left-most bin: empty
		* Middle bin: full of rich topsoil (only 2" deep, covers a patient ochre jelly).
		* Right-hand bin: coated in a flaky, orange precipitate (if rehydrated, acts as a 10 doses of healing potion).
	* Secret Door (east): opens by pulling the closest wall sconce; a 4’x3’ section of wall grinds open, revealing SL4-49.
* As soon as the threshold is crossed, a sighing sound emanates from the corpse; 2 rounds later, a spectre materializes and attacks.
	* GM: play up his slavemaster cruelty, seeing all living beings as "disobedient slaves", and "I don't care if the city is in chaos, you'll do as you're told!"

Circular Lockbox
* The lock is hard to pick (-10%) and the poison needle is hard to locate (-10%), but the trap is easy to remove (+5%).
* Inside: ten disks (28” in diameter) of grooved beaten gold with 1” holes in their centers (like record LPs) (200 gp, can be used to operate the lesser obsidian gates (SL4-34)).

GM Backstory
* This was the residence and office of the Overseer of Labor, the Archontean official who maintained the (slave) labor force that lived in and around the Hall of Labor.
* Though lost for hundreds of years and only recently rediscovered, the chamber retains a taboo status among the goblin descendants of those laborers as the symbol of hated oppression.  The ominous graffiti on the door has only contributed to their unwillingness to venture within.
* As the Archonteans withdrew from Arden Vul, a brave goblin managed to stab the last overseer, a particularly vicious fellow named Trebizet, in the back, killing him. Trebizet rose immediately as a spectre, and his brave assassin fled; the assassin and his friends locked the door and inscribed it with graffiti. Trebizet has haunted the chamber ever since.

Trebizet the spectre: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 7+3; HP 52; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; 
immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

1 ochre jelly: SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 30’; HD 6; HP 41; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special defenses: lightning divides into half-sized creatures.

### SL4-49: Ogre Guards

* King Weskenim assigned a second detachment of his eunuch ogres (SL4-25) as guards of this strategic route to the lower levels.
	* The chamber is dark and rank.
		* The ogres defaced the old Archontean frescoes with crude images and slogans.
	* Eight bedrolls, barrels of brandy and of water, a table and eight battered chairs, and two halfling corpses being cured on hooks.
	* A pay chest (locked, poison needle; key in the water barrel).
		* 275 gp, 653 sp, 24 sards (50 gp each), and the ogres’ contract with Weskenim.
	* Winches for the two portcullises (SL4-52a and SL4-52b) flank the door.
	* In the southeast corner is a Thothian Teleportation Ring (BK-RE-YE-GR-BL-WH).
		* Neither goblins nor ogres have any idea how it works.
	* Secret Door (west): extremely difficult to detect (1 in 10 chance).
		* From this side it can only be opened by force.

* Two ogres are always at SL4-52a.
	* If the remainder hear the warning sound made by this pair, they emerge ready for a fight within 2 rounds.
* Like their fellows, these eunuch ogres are content with their lot, unlikely to betray Weskenim.
	* They consider themselves loyal to Weskenim personally, and the other goblins.
	* If they believe Weskenim dead, they will depart for the Arena (6-68) . 

6 ogres: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 31, 29, 28, 27, 25, 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

### SL4-50: Giant Badgers

	* Two badger-wranglers from SL4-55 lounge at the entrance to this cave at all times.
		* The entrance is barred by a portcullis.
		* Just inside is a rack with four 5’-long badger-poles, several sets of harnesses, and two saddles. 
		* Further back in the cave are the two badgers, whom Weskenim has named Stinky and White-nose.

### SL4-51: Hallway with Winch

* This hallway was one of the main entry points to the Hall of Labor in antiquity.
	* A winch in the north wall operates the portcullis at SL4-52A.
	* A pair of 6’-tall marble statues stand against the north and south walls.
		* The north statue (in heroic, socialist-realist style) depicts a muscled human laborer wielding a pair of hammers.
		* The south statue depicts a goblin employing mason’s tools.
			* The goblins love the southern statue, and have named it Jeskenim, after the legendary first king of their tribe. They decorate it with colorful scarves, turbans, and pantaloons. 

### SL4-52: Portculli
##### SL4-52a: Portcullis

* A heavy iron portcullis blocks the passage here.
	* It is operated by a winch just to the west (SL4-51), or by the winch in SL4-49. 
	* A pair of ogres stand in front of the portcullis, demanding both tribute and the reasons for entry into the Goblin Warrens.
		* Regardless of reasons, the expected tribute is 10 gp/person as a gift to King Weskenim (1 gp/person for return visitors and/or inhabitants of the Halls). 
		* The ogres expect an equal bribe.
			* If suitable payment is not forthcoming, they rattle their weapons on the portcullis, alerting their fellows in SL4-49.
			* If combat breaks out, the goblin guards at SL4-40 will come to investigate, probably with the giant badgers in tow (66% chance), arriving in 4 rounds, lifting the portcullis from the west to help the door guards.

2 ogres: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 27, 23; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

##### SL4-52b: Hidden Portcullis

* This second portcullis is usually kept raised; only lowered by the ogres in SL4-49 when summoned to combat at SL4-52A.
* It can be detected as a secret door.

### SL4-53: Stairs to 6-66

* This wide hallway leads to an impressive stone staircase which descends 475’, curves north and then east, and debouches at the Arena (6-66).
	* The stairs are relatively clean and well-traveled; this is the primary route denizens of the lower levels come to negotiate with the goblins.
	* Note: those teleported here by a one-way teleporter on the blue pillar (4-167) arrive just east of the portcullis (SL4-52a).

### SL4-54: Storage

* This broken corridor-fragment is where the goblins store excess fuel and other sundries.
	* Dozens of stacks of ancient wood (including much salvaged furniture) and packets of dried mushroom clutter the area.
	* Two decomposing xorn carcasses hang from hooks, being readied for the badgers.
	* Small item of mundane value: use probabilities and results table from SL4-46 to determine if and what anything is present.

### SL4-55: Badger Handlers

* The badger handlers (SL4-34) reside in this long corridor fragment.
	* The western end holds badger food: 6 sides of meat from various unpleasant sources (hanging from hooks), 12 fresh spider husks, and several dozen beetle carcasses.
	* Halfway down the corridor are the hammocks of the handlers, as well as a rack holding bits, harnesses, and badger-gaffs.
	* Two of the handlers are always stationed at SL4-50, while the other four rest here.

4 goblin badger-handlers (as orcs): SZ M; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1; HP 7, 7, 6, 6; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8 (morning star). Possessions: morning stars.

11 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 6, 6, 5(x3), 4(x3), 3, 2; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

		* The command word (Mithric) ‘speak’ is written on the bottom of the bust.
		* The goblins call it “King Wesky the First”.
		* The Priscian visitors (SL4-44) have learned of the existence of this sage and are scheming to acquire it.
