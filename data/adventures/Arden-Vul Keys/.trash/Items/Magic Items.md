#### Acorn of Fenth
* In Thorcin stories, Fenth was a Jotun who tyrannized the people of his domain, demanding blood sacrifices in order to allow harvest to occur.  Without his permission, crops would rot in the field, and people would starve.  He would plant acorns, water them with blood, and they grew into burning wicker men, the Harvest Lords, as cruel agents to watch for those who tried to escape their "debt" and punish them.
* An acorn of Fenth (3" across), if planted in soil and watered with blood (human or animal), summons a Harvest Lord.  It is free-willed and malign, ready to bargain for its service.  The planter has an 18 Charisma for bargaining and swaying the being.
