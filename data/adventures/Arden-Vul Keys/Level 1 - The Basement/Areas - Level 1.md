### Overview

* The cellars of a ruined Thothian administrative building, accessible AV-17.
* No major factions, merely vermin, dangerously weakened masonry, and a few surprises for the clever and/or unwary.
* A useful starting point for neophytes, as well as some alternate routes to the deeper levels.

* Archontean-built
* NPCs
	* Lankios (1-6)

Entry / Exit
* Stairs at 1-1 to AV-17
* Narrow chimney at 1-19 to AV-17
* Spiral stairs at 1-21 to 3-27
* Privy hole at 1-20 to 5-85


### 1-1: Basement

* The staircase from the ruins above (AV-17) leads down 60’ before opening into an immense pillared hall (with 20’ ceiling), the main storage facility for the priests of Thoth.
	* Dark except for faint light from the stairs.
	* The 16 pillars are heavy stone, ~4’ in diameter, and all show signs of stress and damage.
	* The floor is choked with dust, grime, broken masonry, smashed barrels and boxes, wooden furniture, and all manner of trash 2' high.
		* Above the trash hang ribbons of dusty cobwebs.
		* Moving in the rubble (+2x difficult terrain) increases encounters to 3-in-6 per 2 Turns.
			* Among the junk, is the marble left leg of the colossal statue of Arden (AV-30).
	* A 3’-wide path has been cleared towards the wide double-doors facing the stairs. The double doors are cracked open, and appear badly damaged.
			* Two corpses lie face down on the path towards the double-doors.
				* A female human cleric and a male human fighter, both recent with multiple sting/injection marks and necrotic, blackened skin.
					* The cleric clutches a still-full potion bottle (elixir of health).
					* Wearing chain mail and splint mail.  Any other valuables are gone.

##### 1-1a: Ruined Doors

* These massive double doors are cracked open about 18”, and are in very bad shape.
	* The wood is swollen with moisture, the reinforcing iron bands are thick with rust, and the doors seem to have been assaulted with sharp or heavy objects.
	* They are difficult to move (stuck door check), but medium characters can squeeze through in one round, but this leaves them open to attack from the giant centipedes of 1-1B.

##### 1-1b: Giant Centipedes

* A colony of 20 giant centipedes nests in the rubble-choked hallway beyond the double doors. 
	* Only 7-13 are present at any given time (subtract losses from wandering encounters).
	* They hear anyone squeezing through the doors at 1-1A, and swarm to the attack.
	* The centipedes completely ignore anyone smeared with anti-vermin paste of Lankios (1-6).

20 giant centipedes: SZ S; AL N; AC 9; MV 150’; HD 1 or 2 HP; HP 2(x10), 1(x10); #AT 1; Dmg n.a. Special attacks: poison (+4 to save)

### 1-2: Spider Closet

* A badly warped wooden door hangs crazily on its hinges.
	* Inside the closet is an impressive web spun by a colony of giant spiders.
		* 8 large spiders: SZ S; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’, 150’ in web; HD 1+1; HP 7, 7, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2; #AT 1; Dmg 1. Special attacks: poison (+2 to saves).
	* Some broken wooden crates litter the floor.
		* A ruby (50 gp) has fallen to the floor, and may be found within 1-4 rounds of searching.
		* A damaged scroll (Divine Breath of Thoth” (see AV books) is in the NE corner.

3 spiders fled from the fire: hp 7, 5, 6

##### 1-2a: Spider Web

* The spiders have spun a very thin, but strong, web across the entrance to 1-3.
	* In the darkness it is easy to miss the web (Spot vs 7) for any but the most cautious of characters to become bound in the webs.
		* The spiders will emerge immediately and attack.
		* An enwebbed victim can escape in (15-Strength) rounds.
		* If the spiders are dead, a victim's thrashing may draw the attention of the giant snake from 1-11 (5% per round, cumulative).
	* 55 cp, 38 sp and 10 gp lie scattered on the floor.

### 1-3: Training Ground

* An open room, used for training.  The floor is relatively clear, with a thick layer of dust.
	* No signs of humanoid traffic disturb the dust, although a few lumps disturb it.
		* The lumps are rotting remains of wooden staffs and poles, as well as one shield.
	* On a pedestal on the eastern side is a dusty but untarnished silver chalice (50 gp).
		* The chalice may be put to good use in the mosaic room (1-12).

### 1-4: Storeroom

* Aside from a 5’-radius semicircle around the door, this room is choked with worthless debris.

### 1-5: Storeroom with Porter

* Another refuse heap similar 1-4.  An unusual zombie stands just to the left of the door.
		* It was created as a porter for some long-dead wizard.
		* It lurches towards any intruders as they enter the room, but will not attack even if itself attacked.  It imprints on the first person it sees and follows that person faithfully until prevented from doing so.
		* It occasionally utters grunts and groans, and can carry surprisingly large loads (200 lb).  It moves slowly (30’), smells badly, and will cause a negative reaction in most civilized locations.
		* It wears a dog collar with silver chasing (10 gp) around its neck.

4 / 7


### 1-6: Lankios the Hermit

* The door is in better repair than others in the complex, with well-oiled hinges and working lock.
	* Those approaching see a faint light under the door, and smell a foul stench of rotting vegetal matter from a good 30’ away.
* This large, former storage room is now the abode of a wizened human hermit named Lankios (66% chance of being present).
	* Tripod of Heating's fire crackles smokelessly in one corner, blackened pot bubbling with foul-smelling goo.  Small vermin corpses (rats, stirges) hang curing near the fire.
	* The chamber is tidy, with no dust; a rush broom hangs from a peg by the door.
	* A neat bedroll lies against the left wall.  A barrel containing water stands underneath a perpetual drip from the ceiling.
	* Very well hidden under a loose flagstone, is Lankios' treasure, stashed while he was still sane (he's since forgotten it's there).
		* A huge diamond (1,500 gp); a periapt of proof against poison; an ankh-key; a scroll of 6 cleric spells (light, cure light wounds, slow poison, find traps, dispel magic, and continual light); a scroll with three magic user spells (spider climb, jump, and detect invisibility); a green glass Thothian teleporation activation square; and a gold key to the Obsidian Gates (5-6d).
* The Goo
	* Smells completely foul, a distillate of verminous beasts, water, and sludge from the pool in 1-7.  It is both nutritious (if nauseating) food and vermin repellent.
	* Daubing the goo on the body causes local vermin to avoid you for 3 hours.
* Lankios the Hermit
	* 280 years old and preserved by a curse (see 5-11).  Once a formidable paladin, Lankios has gone insane.
	* Barefoot, dressed in a ragged tunic, with a smelly necklace of vegetable matter, doused in repellent goo.  He boasts an impressive white beard and long white hair.
	* Delighted to talk to anyone who doesn't threaten him, but speaks in obtuse, semi-poetical phrases.
		* Offers the respectful a chance to partake of his excellent feast.
		* Often breaks into guffaws of laughter or sobs of tormented grief.
		* Babbles about a lovely mage, Guivrel, a competition for her hand, and betrayal by a trusted friend, named “K”.  His role in that story is unclear.
		* Quite familiar with all of the chambers on this level, and a bit of Level 3 and 5.   Hard to get him to describe those areas with coherence or linearity. 
		* Might (especially if asked about the secret door in 1-19) mention the key he put at the bottom of the pool in 1-7).  Will warn of the "nasties".
	* Lankios the hermit, 10th-level Archontean paladin of the Immortal Flame
		* SZ M; AL LG; AC 9; MV 120’; HD 9+3; HP 62 (max 79); #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (staff). Abilities: STR 13, INT 11, WIS 13, DEX 15, CON 15, CHA 17. Possessions: staff, key to the door at 1-6.
		* Lankios is 280 years old, kept alive by Fate / the Flame for specific reasons (see 5-11). He is insane but not fallen, and can still use his paladin abilities. In his madness he has not prayed for clerical spells in more than a century.
		* Avoids combat completely, defends himself only if cornered.
	* Removing the Curse
		* The reappearance of his love, Guivrel, or a remove curse from a 10th-level cleric.
			* Guivrel’s remains lie at 5-11; bringing her signet to him, and assuring him that judgment has been made, and/or that Kaitor has been punished may restore him to sanity (see 5-11).
		* If brought to his senses, Lankios recognizes that he is centuries old, and with little to live for. He is grateful, but not slavishly so. He is old, and most of his powers are gone. 
			* He will likely answer any and all questions asked, and can give excellent current information about all of Level 1; and centuries old info about areas 3-2, 3-14 to 3-16, 3-18 to 3-20, 3-25 to 3-28, and 3-30 to 3-31 on Level 3, and areas 5-1 to 5-8, and 5-10 to 5-31.
			* He rewards his rescuers with his treasure, stashed behind a loose flagstone while he was still sane.
				* If sane, he can confirm that his gold key is intended for the Gates, but he and his comrades never found a platinum key to match it.

### 1-7: Pool of Sludge

* Ankh-marked door.
* A raised pool (4’ tall) dominates the center of this room. Orange tiles (2' square, mostly intact, each painted with a white ibis) cover the walls, floor, pool containment walls, and ceiling of this chamber.
	* The pool is 15’ in diameter.
		* It originally contained a liquid with qualities of curing and protection, but currently contains a foul-smelling brown sludge the consistency of molasses.
			* Still cures 1d4 HP damage per draught and confers a +1 defense against vermin and undead for 6 turns.  Its noxious smell make it hard to swallow.
		* 10-20 draughts in the pool, slowly replaces 1d6 draughts per week.
		* At the bottom of the pool: a bronze key to the secret door at 1-14.
	* A robed corpse lies in the northeast corner, where Lankios unceremoniously pushed it (“so as not to spoil the pool!”).  A dagger is clutched in her hand.
		* Human magic user, drained of blood through several large wounds on her neck (a victim of the stirges in 1-19).
		* Belt pouches: a linen bag filled with gold dust (75 gp), a scroll of detect magic, and a vial of oil.
	* 15% of the time Lankios is here.

20 / 20 draughts

### 1-8: Three Wise Monkeys

* Baboon head-marked door.
* The trash and junk that are of this level have been pushed to the sides of this room, leaving 5’ radius clear around a small stone pedestal (5’ tall) in the exact center of the chamber. 
	* A bone scroll case rests on the floor near the pedestal.
		* Holds a scroll (identify, Basil’s torch treatment, gust of wind)
	* Three winged stone monkeys about 3’ tall occupy the chamber.
		* A stone monkey 3' tall crouches on the pedestal, facing west.
		* Similar monkeys perched on ledges over each door, hard to spot in the gloom.
			* The three monkeys represent the Three Wise Monkeys who See no Evil, Hear no Evil, and Speak No Evil (can be defeated in combat or neutralized)
	* Corpse: partly buried in the junk on the south side.  A man dressed in leather armor with scorch marks; the man’s ears appear to have bled.
		* Leather armor, short sword, gold ring set with a silver knot (150 gp, a Sortian mark); a 2-lb ingot of platinum (500 gp; Varumani troll-face and hammer mark).
* Each monkey is enchanted to produce a different effect.
	* Once the room is entered, they animate and begin their attack.

3 stone monkeys: SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 0’, 150’ flying (Class C); HD 3+1; HP 23, 19, 18; #AT 1; Dmg special. Special attacks: muting, or fire (1-4 HP), or shriek. Special defenses: non-magical weapons do half damage.
* Speech (pedestal): has a grossly oversized mouth, shaped such that a cylinder could be slid in (the scroll case works).
	* Swivels to face intruders (doesn't leave the pedestal) utters guttural coughs (1 / round, single target, save vs spells or mute for 1d6 turns).  A cylinder in the mouth will silence it.
* Sight (perched over west door): has grotesquely huge round eyes.
	* Flaps about, shooting rays of fire from its eyes (1d4 damage).  Neutralized if blinded or otherwise vision-impaired.
* Hearing (perched over east door): has impossibly large ears.
	* Flaps about, uttering increasingly loud shrieks, 1 / round.
	* The first two shrieks are merely annoying, but the third and later, those within 25' must save vs spells or take 1d6 thunder.  Neutralized if silenced.

0 / 19 (speech)
0 / 18 (hearing)

### 1-9: Empty Chamber

* The trash in this chamber has been pushed to each side, creating a narrow path between the corridor and door to 1-7.
	* Substantial noise (e.g. from searching) risks of attracting the stirges (1-19).  Roll 10-50% chance per event based on amount of noise.

### 1-10: Collapsing Ceiling

* The door of this empty chamber is firmly closed, and stuck.
	* The ceiling of the room within is completely unstable, and any movement inside may (cumulative 25% per round) produce a cave-in.
	* The cave-in begins in the exact center of the room and radiates out, burying the chamber in tons of rock. 
		* Round 1: 1d4 damage to anyone in center 
		* Round 2: 1d6 damage to anyone in southern half 
		* Round 3: 2d6 damage to those in southern half, 1d6 damage in northern half 
		* Round 4: those in southern half are buried and killed, 3d6 damage to those in northern half.

### 1-11: Giant Snake

* A former pantry, wooden shelves still line the walls, rotten and crumbling with any pressure. 
	* The double-doors have been spiked slightly ajar (2’).
	* Numerous skeletons and bits of bone form a carpet across most of the floor.
		* Scattered among the skeletons are a pair of beryls (25 gp each); a pouch (holding 88 sp); a magical iron spear named Nightwind.
	* A giant constrictor snake lairs here, present 25% of the time.
		* 1 giant constrictor snake (25% chance): SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6+1; HP 39; #AT 2; Dmg 1-4/2-8. Special attacks: constriction.

### 1-12: Mosaic Room

* Ibis-headed Thoth-marked door.
* The walls and floor of this small shrine are covered with mosaics depicting rituals in the cult of Thoth (floor mostly obscured by dust and dirt).
	* A 10 ’ x4’ x 3’ stone altar stands on the north side of the room.  In a clear space among the elaborate carvings on the surface is a faint outline of a circle matching the base of the chalice in 1-3.
		* Hidden Panel in base (Spot as secret door): trapped with poison needle.  Contains a pouch 20 rubies (50 gp each) and a Lover’s Token.
			* If the chalice is placed in the circle, the panel opens safely.
	* Several brackets for torches line the walls.
	* The floor mosaic is mostly obscured by dirt and dust, with bare human footprints visible in the grime.
	* 10% chance Lankios the hermit 1-6) is here.
* Mosaics
	* North Wall: humans bring offerings of jewels, coins and scrolls to a large ibis-headed figure, whose left arm is pointing to the distance, parallel to the floor. Above and below this scene are mystical runes and symbols.
		* GM Note: a clue to the safe manipulation of the statues of Thoth at 3-3, 3-15 and 3-40; if the left arms of the three statues are moved to this position, the route to the treasure chamber at 3-23 grinds open!
	* East Wall: a huge white baboon smashing a smaller crocodile with its fists, while humans throw their hands up in fear.
		* GM Note: crudely symbolic of Thoth (the baboon) defeating Set (the crocodile).
	* West Wall: another white baboon clubbing a series of hopping, salamander-like, bipedal creatures.
		* GM Note: a hint about the heqeti foes of Levels 9 and 10.
	* South Wall (west of the door): three orange-robed priests stand in front of a massive set of black doors. One priest touching the door with his hand is being blasted by lightning. The other two priests stand apart, pointing in alarm.
		* GM Note: the doors are the Obsidian Gates (5-6D), warning about the dangers of manipulating them.
	* Floor (initially obscured): once cleared of dust and grime, a large ibis-headed being stands over human corpses prepared for burial, while humans with feathers in their hair pile up grave goods around the Thoth figure.
		* GM Note: a clue as to how employ the feather of Maat (3-19) to avoid undead in the necropolis of Thoth (3-22).

### 1-13: Closet

* This room contains only the recent corpses of a halfling adventurer and a stirge.
	* The halfling is drained of blood.
	* Her corpse still bears a usable, halfling-sized suit of leather armor.  A short sword and sling lie nearby. The corpse also carries a pouch:
		* 10 iron spikes, 10 sling stones, a flask of oil, a parchment note (Archontean) "use the little pyramid to access the Howling Caves. Beware of the Darkness!"  This refers to the Pyramid of Venerable Age in 3-11, offering one of the swiftest and easiest routes from Level 3 to Level 2).

### 1-14: Undead Party

* A hidden study. The plastered walls are flaking in large chunks.  Bookshelves on the west wall have collapsed with rot, and the entire room smells of mildew.
	* A set of wooden chairs that surround a fireplace on the east wall have escaped the rot.
		* A cowled figure appears to sit in one of the chairs, while three or four dog-like skeletons lie at its feet.
		* These undead attack as soon as the chamber is entered.
	* Secret Door (south): operates on a pin; one needs only to push the base of the door inward, and the door will rotate inward at about 4’ up the wall.

1 tough skeleton: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special defenses: immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold; cutting and piercing weapons do half damage; turned as a zombie.

X / 19

### 1-18: Unsafe Roof

* The door to this room is ajar, and stuck. The entire eastern wall has collapsed, and a thick air of rot, moisture, and decay permeates the room.
	* Underneath the rubble a pair of legs protrudes. On one of the feet is a supple leather boot (one of a pair of elven boots, the other is at 3-183).

### 1-19: Stirge Lair

* Approaching one smells a powerful stench of guano.
* A 20' x 45' chamber with a 15' diameter mound (stirge nest) of trash, bones, sticks, and mud in front of a large fireplace on the north wall (probably obscured from view initially).
	* The 1’ x 1’ chimney of the fireplace extends 40’ to the surface, allowing the stirges access to the outside.
		* In the stirge nest: 231 gp, 347 sp, a cone of incense of attraction in a small metal case, a Sortian baculus (no further enchantments), and a leather-bound and badly mutilated journal of Adventuring Notes.
	* The floor is slick with stirge guano, giving -2 attack and damage.
		* Only the far eastern part of the room is free of the guano, along a path from the hall to 1-21, lined with sticks dipped in Lankios’s foul-smelling goo (1-6).
		* The goo repel the stirges, who avoid that area; if forced, they take -1 attack.
	* By the door to 1-21, under the guano, is a Thothian teleportation ring (address: GR-WH-RE-BL-BK-YE).
	* Secret Door (south): locked, a key is at the bottom of the pool in 1-7.

### 1-20: Privy

* The privy is a 3’-diameter hole in a marble plug that covers a much wider (6’) shaft
	* The shaft leads down some 550’ to 5-85.  Iron rungs are hammered into the well shaft at regular intervals.  Although it smells vaguely foul, the privy has not been used as such in centuries.
		* Tied to the fifth rung from the top with fraying hemp twine is a Ring of Change Self. Cumulative 15% chance per person passing this rung to detect it.  A careful search locates it easily.

### 1-21: Spiral Stair

* An open doorway leads to a stone circular stairway.
	* The stairs, dusty but remarkably free of debris, lead down 300’ to 3-27.
	* One may note the existence of some bare human footprints made by Lankios (1-6) who occasionally wanders here.
