Roll on the Great Chasm encounter chart (see 9-1)

## The Silent Canyon

* 9-108 to 9-126
* 2-in-10 chance every 2 turns
	* All random encounters will be heqeti old one ambushers who clamber out of the sand of the canyon to assault intruders

3-6 heqeti old ones (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6+6; HP 47, 45, 40, 39, 38, 37; #AT 1 Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as spectres; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells. So long as the Old Father (see 9-126) still ‘lives’, there is an infinite supply of heqeti old ones. Should he be slain, then only 18 more can rise from the sands as random encounters.

## The Rimpled Run and the River Caves

* 9-71, 9-127 to 9-150
* 1-in-8 chance every 4 turns

* Select the encounter based on the location of the party.
	* e.g. in 9-140 to 9-150), the encounter might be with a hydra from 9-143 (25%) or 3-6 of the cave skinks (see new monsters) from areas 9-144 to 9-146).

## The Rudishva Bastion

* 9-89, 9-90, 9-93, 9-96, 9-97
* The only possible encounter here is with the harmless rudishva dust ionizer (tech).

	* PCs may hear the whine and light trundle of its trackballs.
	* Although possibly alarming, the ionizer is completely harmless.
