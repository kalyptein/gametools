### Overview

The focus of this level is the enormous cavern lying at the base of the Great Chasm that extends throughout Arden Vul. Surrounding cave systems and a handful of isolated and (mostly) abandoned outposts of the ancient occupants of Arden Vul provide additional 
interest. The western half of this enormous cavern has no roof, and intrepid explorers are thus capable of accessing Level 9 from any of the upper levels that open into the chasm. The eastern portion of the cavern, however, is enclosed, with a 50’ ceiling soaring over the cavern floor. The floor of the cavern is mostly taken up by groves of colossal mushrooms, groves that are split into northern and southern halves by the lake formed by the two waterfalls falling from the upper levels. An underground river, the Rimpled Run, exits the cavern to the north (9-127, 9-141). The central cavern is home to all manner of monsters, including a vicious band of quicklings (9-4, 9-13 to 9-15).

Over the millennia all intelligent species have attempted to impose their will on the level, and thus remnants of heqeti, rudishva, Archontean, and Sortian building programs may be 
found branching out from the cavern walls. Some of these ancient, and other more modern, groups have begun to re-colonize the cavern floor, although to date only in cautious, exploratory ways. The heqeti have occupied the chambers leading to Level 10 (areas 9-76 to 9-82), and regularly hunt in the fungal forests. The kaliyani have sent an exploration team from Sub-Level 9 (9-118). The varumani not only hunt in the mushroom groves but have also 
established a silver mining operation to the south of the cavern (9-20 to 9-27). Finally, the Priscians have recently reoccupied the old (and hidden) Sortian compound (9-58 to 9-64). Other, older threats still exist in the ruins, including a camp of deadly demonic huntsmen (9-50), a tower occupied by ogre magi (9-70), the heqeti Old Father (9-126), a vengeance spirit of Sekhmet (9-104), and an Archontean-era lich (9-55).

Significant Regions of Level 9

The Floor of the Chasm (areas 9-1 to 9-12, 9-16, 9-49 to 9-51, 9-65 to 9-67, 9-70 to 9-76, 9-83 to 9-87, 9-98, 9-108)
* The Great Chasm extends downward from Level 2 through most of Arden Vul before ending here, in a massive cavern. The cavern is defined by the twin waterfalls that fall from the upper levels (9-66, 9-67) into a lake (9-65) before draining to the north in an underground river called the Rimpled Run (9-71). The western part of the region, around the lake and waterfalls, has no ceiling; to the north and east, however, the cavern has a ceiling that averages about 30’ in height. North and south of the lake are extensive groves of giant mushrooms, amid which a variety of monsters thrive.
* Factions
	* No faction controls the chasm floor, although the quicklings (9-4, 9-13 to 9-15) are active in the southern mushroom groves, and the ogre magi (9-70) and the aroksachaul (9-50) regularly hunt throughout the region.
* Construction
	* The worked stone present in this region is very old, typically of either heqeti (9-75 and 9-76) or ancient Archontean (9-70) construction.
* Environment
	* The region is generally humid and warm, thanks to the waterfalls (9-66 and 9-67) and plant life. The noise of the waterfalls falling into the lake (9-65) makes is easier to surprise foes; chances increase by 1 within 50’ of the lake shore. Phosphorescence from the mushroom groves north and south of the lake provides dim light.

The Silver Mine (9-19 to 9-27)
* The varumani have mined this series of caves and tunnels for silver for centuries. The miners are efficient and uninterested in talking or plotting (although the mine boss has been skimming silver from the operation). The region is defended to the north by a natural choke-point, where the varumani have built a defensive wall (9-21). Some of the mine tunnels lead upwards to the varumani regions of Level 7.
* Factions
	* The varumani fully control this region, and are quick to eliminate any threats in the form of monsters, other factions, or foolish adventurers.
* Construction
	* The only piece of construction is the varumani-built defensive wall at 9-21.
* Environment
	* The region is cool and dry.

The Priscian Compound (9-58 to 9-64A)
* A small, secret outpost delved in antiquity by the Sortians (see World of Archontos appendix) defines this region. The outpost remained hidden from the imperial administration thanks to illusions cast at area 9-58 and to the Sortians’ unique teleportation system that makes use of Sortian eyes (see new magic items). The modern Priscians, who somewhat disingenuously claim to be descendants of the Sortians, reclaimed the outpost a few decades ago when the Priscian archmage Nerub Null (9-64) rediscovered it. So long as it remains secret, the outpost provides a safe refuge for Priscian exploration teams; it contains residences, storage halls, a means of teleporting to other Sortian areas, and, perhaps most significantly, the arcanum forge (9-60). The Priscians have restored the forge, which has allowed them to begin making some of the legendary Sortian equipment; as yet, however, they have not fully mastered the forge’s secrets. 
* Factions
	* The region is fully controlled by the Priscians.
* Construction
	* Construction is in the late classical style of the Archontean empire, although the Priscians have modernized it. 
* Environment
	* Normal dungeon conditions apply here.

The Rudishva Bastion (9-89 to 9-97)
* This ultra-secret region was the command post for rudishva operations in Arden Vul and served as the residence for the bridge crew of the Beacon. It is has remained secret for 2,800 years because it is extremely difficult to access. The transit shaft (9-91), which extends downward from Level 5 to this location, provides the most likely access route. A ‘back door’ at area 9-88 provides the only other point of entry, but a combination of clever concealment and still-operative rudishva point defense arrays (see new technological items) has kept this route secret as well. As a result, the bastion is in excellent condition; several important secrets, including the propulsion formula that might allow the rudishva shuttle (SL13-37) to fly between the stars, may be found here.
* Factions
	* No faction controls this area, as no living souls have visited it in several millennia.
* Construction
	* The entire region is rudishva construction.
* Environment
	* The region is dry and cool.

The Praitorion (9-100 to 9-107)
* A once-important, if seldom-visited and poorly-understood, region of Arden Vul, this small complex was built in the aftermath of Archon Marius’s conquest of the heqeti. It served as a command center and forward position from which to watch for heqeti recrudescence. Over the centuries, as the heqeti threat receded into legend, the Praitorion came to serve a mostly ceremonial role as a symbol of Archontean glory. It was also by tradition the complex in which one of the great items of archonal regalia, the tablet of the Beacon (see 9-107) was housed. Although it is assumed that the tablet was lost during the Archontean retreat some 1,200 years ago, the tablet still rests in its reliquary, where it is guarded by Celsus Torquatius, a fearsome vengeance aspect of Sekhmet (9-104).
* Factions
	* No faction controls the region, and few visit it due to the formidable power of Celsus Torquatius.
* Construction
	* The entire area is Archontean construction.
* Environment
	* The region is dry and cool.

The Silent Canyon (9-109 to 9-126)
* This region was one of the first settled by the heqeti in the distant past. Their dwellings were built along the side walls of a tall, narrow cave, whose dimensions make it appear to be a canyon. Ritual and public spaces were built into the rock to the south of the canyon. The region has been unoccupied for almost 3,000 years, since the rudishva newcomers slew the heqeti living in the canyon and concealed the entire region behind a secret door (9-108). Those ancient heqeti still haunt the region as a form of undead known as the heqeti old ones, under the domination of a powerful undead spirit, the Old Father (9-126). As the Archonteans never discovered the region, it has lain silent for centuries.
* Factions
	* No faction controls this region. A team of kaliyani has just entered the region for the purpose of exploration (9-118).
* Construction
	* The dwellings along the canyon proper are built of drystone flint walls. The delved areas (9-120 to 9-126) are of typical heqeti construction.
* Environment
	* The region is dry and cool.

## Level 9: 1 - 15

### 9-1: Great Cavern at the Foot of the Great Chasm 

One of the iconic features of the Halls, this massive fissure extends through most of the dungeon levels and provides a sure, if difficult, means of vertical navigation of the Halls. The fissure is generally shaped like a triangular prism, with its apex about 50’ above Level 2. The prism extends downward 1,600’ through the Halls until it levels out at the floor of the chasm (9-1) hundreds of feet below.

The Great Chasm bottoms out here. The foot of the chasm is an enormous cavern, some 600’x 450’ in size, one that spreads out beyond the vertical part of the chasm to encompass surrounding caves and worked areas. Two waterfalls, one from 5-2A and the other from 6-6A, combine here to form a large lake, out of which a river flows to areas further underground. Given the presence of the waterfalls, the entire level is noisy and humid; indeed, it is difficult to hear or speak around the lake due to the noise. Phosphorescence from the mushroom groves provides a dim light to illuminate most of the central cavern. Individual features of the cavern, such as the two mushroom groves, the effluent canals, the plateaus, and the seeing chair, are described separately. 

The western portions of the great cavern (west of the dotted line on the map) have no ceiling, as the chasm rises above them all the way to Level 2. East of the dotted line on the map, however, the cavern does have a ceiling; it is roughly 50’ tall, that is, 50’ above the level of the lake.

GM Note: The floor of the chasm can be altered by destroying the dam at SL6-25. In this case, a massive amount of water will flow down the spillway and cause the waterfall from 6-6A to become a raging torrent for several hours. This influx of water will raise the water level by 15’ for a period of 7-10 hours. During this time period, the midden (9-87), the muck fields (9-7), the berm (9-9), the sluice gate (9-10), and a swathe of the mushroom fields (in area 
9-4, a zone from the lake to area 9-6; in area 9-83, a zone from the lake to 9-76) will be swept clear of anything that is not stone. After the lake resumes its normal level, these areas will be covered with a layer of muck.

Those who can fly or climb long distances can follow the chasm upwards to 8-2, 7-3, 6-108, 5-34, 3-38 and 2-63A. Such persons use the lower zone chart for random encounters while on Level 9, rolling every three turns with a 1 in 6 chance for an encounter:

### 9-2: The Dread Risers (up to 7-2)

The 3,666 steps of this staircase commence at the small hillock (9-3) on the chasm floor. From there, they circle a stone ridge through a series of switchbacks before joining the chasm wall; they then climb the chasm wall until they reach area 7-2. The Dread Risers 
average about 3’ in width and climb a total of about 300’. Those using light on the Risers, and especially on the ridge, are likely to alert the quicklings (see 9-14 to 9-15), the huntsmen (9-50) and other denizens of the giant cavern. 

A small fragment of the broken end of an ancient heqeti bridge protrudes from the ridge around which the Risers circle. The fragment originally connected to area 9-31; the gap in the broken segments of the bridge is 15’ wide, and thus could be jumped.

### 9-3: Hillock with Statue

A small hillock of stone rises offers a commanding view of the mushroom groves that surround it (9-4). The hillock lies 15’ above the floor of the grove, and also serves as the starting point for the Dread Risers (9-2). 

A battered, 8’-tall statue of Wadjet, the ancient Archontean deity of protection, stands on the hillock just where it adjoins the chasm wall. Wadjet appears as a young woman clothed in a simple tunic, albeit with the head of a cobra. Despite missing both arms, and possessing numerous gouges along its torso, the statue retains its beautiful polychromed head. An aura of calm and peace is palpable, since, indeed, the protective spirit of Wadjet is still present here. Should anyone beseech Wadjet orally and by name, the entire hillock will immediately be covered with the equivalent of a protection from evil spell; the radius of the protection is the entire hillock, and it lasts for 6 turns. If the statue is beheaded, the protection function disappears forever.

### 9-4: Southern Mushroom Groves 

The southern third of the cavern slopes downward towards the southeast, that is, towards the cesspool at 9-16. Several millennia worth of effluent and debris has accumulated atop the cavern floor south of the lake, forming a rich bed of humus some 40’ deep and masking the steepness of the slope. Atop the humus grows a large forest of giant mushrooms, fed and watered by a network of small canals containing brown, sludgy liquid (see 9-5). As a result, the entire area smells a bit foul. As some of the mushroom species (e.g. orange lamps) are phosphorescent, the groves are relatively well lit. Amid the mushrooms are a few special areas of note, including a secluded mushroom market (9-6), a mostly-buried colossal statue (9-12), and a promontory boasting a rudishva seat of contemplation (9-11). 

The groves teem with life and sound thanks to the chittering of the numerous species of small insects, harmless bats, and baindara (see new monsters) that call the area home. 

A thick net of spider webs cover the southern portion of the cave, roughly between areas 9-29 and 9-16. Aside for about 5’ of empty space above the tops of the largest mushrooms, the webs completely fill the space above the groves. In addition, vertical webs some 10’ wide crisscross the opening to the southern lobe of the cavern (leading to 9-16). A tribe of giant spiders lives in the webs, as well as in a side cave (9-17). Those blundering about under the webs are likely (75%) to attract the attention of 2-4 giant spiders; these monsters like nothing more than dropping on unsuspecting victims from above, although they may also wait in hopes that the prey snares itself in the vertical webs. Loud and sustained combat draws the rest of the tribe in 3-4 rounds, although if clearly outclassed the spiders will retreat to area 9-17.

The groves are tended by quicklings (see 9-14 and 9-15), who carefully harvest and dry the fungi before trading the dried specimens to the varumani and other sentient beings (see 9-6). A bewildering network of small tunnels (9-15) runs through the humus underlying the grove; dozens of well-disguised holes allow the quicklings to appear almost anywhere within the grove at a moment’s notice. For every turn spent in the groves, there is a 25% chance that a quickling strike force emerges from the tunnels to harass the PCs. Unless they encounter easy pickings, the quicklings are only likely to spend 2 rounds attacking the PCs 
before disappearing down one of the tunnels. For more on their tunnel-fighting methods, see 9-15.

Mushroom Groves: Colossal mushrooms fill the cavern south of the lake (9-65) and the band of muck (9-7). The grove rises 10’ to 15’ in height, and includes all of the fungal species listed in the new flora appendix: orange lamps, white ribs, blue trumpets, eye-openers, cloud caps, white bulbs, aqua vitae, mind eaters, red veil and slow steppers. The groves are densely packed, since the quicklings who manage them (see 9-14) do not need wide trails. Movement is possible through the forest, but at half the normal rate. When moving on the floor of the grove, direction is hard to maintain; one must roll 6d4+2 under WIS (or possess tracking skills) to maintain the proper direction. 

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, a portion of the groves in a zone extending from 9-65 to 9-6 will be swept clear of anything that is not stone (including mushrooms). After 7-10 hours, this area will drain, leaving a layer of sticky muck.

The quicklings delight in laying traps among the groves. Their traps come in two forms, tripwires and small holes with punji sticks. Each turn of movement amid the fungi results in a 1 in 8 chance of stumbling upon a trap; the likelihood increases to 1 in 6 if one is following an effluent canal. Once a trap is indicated, there is a 66% chance it is a tripwire, and a 33% chance it is a hole with punji sticks.

Tripwires: The tripwires have tiny bells on them. Activating a tripwire has a 50% chance of drawing a band of 3-6 quicklings to harass and possibly attack the hapless victim(s).

Holes with Punji Sticks: The holes are about 18” in diameter and just as deep, with punji sticks angled downward into the hole. The quicklings cover the holes with loose wood and mulch; they are only activated by a creature or object weighing more than 50 lb. Such a trap inflicts 1-3 HP damage, and halves the victim’s movement until that damage is healed. Releasing a foot from a hole takes three rounds of careful activity; more hasty removal inflicts another 1-3 HP damage.

Searching the Fungal Forest: For each turn spent searching the for-est, it is possible (1 in 6 chance) that the PCs might come across something interesting:

Special defenses: save as 19th-level clerics; never surprised; 90% invisible when moving, 100% when motionless; impossible to surprise. Special: ventriloquism, forget, levitate, shatter, dig, and fire charm. There is a 33% chance that any given quickling has coated his/her dagger with spider venom. One of the team has 2-4 skulls filled with acid (2-8 HP, 1 HP splash) attached to his/her belt.

### 9-5: Effluent Canals

Generations of inhabitants of Arden Vul have tossed their human and other waste into the chasm, where much of it ends up floating in the lake. The quicklings have capitalized on this pungent but useful resource. They skim waste from the lake, and direct it into a network of small canals that run through the mushroom groves and end up in the cesspit (9-16). The canals are typically about 2.5’ wide and just as deep. Most of the time the canals are filled with a sludgy, brown, foul-smelling liquid that flows slowly towards the southeast. The quicklings can alter the viscosity of the canals through use of the sluice gate (for details on its operation, see 9-10). Given the contents of the canals, those stepping into them or otherwise coming into contact with the effluent have a 5% chance of catching a disease. Searching among the effluent is generally fruitless, as the quicklings take pains to keep the canals raked clean. Still there is a 10% chance per turn of locating a gemstone (roll randomly for type) or 1-4 randomly-determined coins.

### 9-6: Mushroom Market

A small fire burns merrily in the center of this clearing in the midst of the mushroom forest. Around it stand three wooden racks from which hang specimens of dried mushrooms. Two 
quicklings are always present here, and there is a 33% chance that a true varumani is also present to trade for mushrooms. All of the usual residents of this marketplace are willing to talk first, but if visitors prove threatening a full complement of quicklings will arrive within 2 rounds (see 9-15), and the varumani will join in on the quicklings’s side. Visitors are welcome to participate in the trading: the quicklings prefer gemstones, exotic alcohol, or amulets 
made of precious metals (and/or magic) in trade. The quicklings sometimes have varumani knock-out juice (see Arden Vul items) for sale, although they would never admit this to the varumani. One has to ask specifically. 

The following chart indicates the likelihood that a given variety is available for sale, as well as the asking price for a standard six-specimen bundle of any given variety. There will always be at least three bundles available for sale or trade.

Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword; ring mail.

Treasure:
Bundles of mushrooms (6 doses per bundle).

### 9-7: Muck Field

A band of thick, viscous muck runs between the lake (9-65) and the southern mushroom groves (9-4). This muck is the product of centuries of effluent being tossed down the chasm and washing up on the shore of the lake. Delimited by the berm (9-9) for most of its length, the entire field is malodorous and quite slippery. It is also potentially dangerous; spending time in it has a 5% cumulative chance per turn of causing a disease. Because the muck is about 3’ deep in most places, movement by creatures weighing 50 lb or more is difficult: movement is halved, and combat penalties apply (-1 to initiative and -2 to ‘to hit’ rolls). A band of hungry bestial varumani hunts in the northeastern portion of the field (see 9-8 for details); they are inured to the disease-effect of the muck field. Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the muck fields will be swept clear of anything that is not stone. After 7-10 hours, this area will drain, leaving a fresh layer of sticky muck.

### 9-8: Varumani Cave

Six renegade bestial varumani (see new monsters) dwell in the northeastern portion of the muck field, below the escarpment leading up to the plateau (9-49). They have dug a cave into that escarpment, in which they store their small supply of treasure.

The renegades are adept at combat in the muck. They have developed a number of clever combat tactics, including waiting until foes are mired in the muck, running and sliding into battle, and attempting to grapple and then drown foes in the slime. 

The bestial varumani are afraid of their true and lesser varumani cousins, however, and cower in their cave whenever such beings are sighted (e.g. the hunters – see 7-14). Members of this band slain as wandering monsters can be replaced in 2-5 weeks; should the band be wiped out, however, the cave remains empty. Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the cave will fill almost completely with water. After 7-10 hours, the 
cave will drain, leaving a layer of sticky muck but taking with it all 
the varumani’s treasure.

6 bestial varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58, 55, 53, 52, 50, 49; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10 Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; immune to poison.

Treasure:
In a smelly sack the renegades have accumulated: 5,972 cp, 4,119 sp, 1,956 gp; in addition there is an ever-full inkwell and a glass sphere of arcane assistance – dispelling (see new magic items for each).

### 9-9: Berm and Bridge

A 6’-tall, 4’-wide berm runs in an arc along the northern edge of the mushroom groves before climbing the escarpment to the plateau (9-49). The top of the berm is flat and well-trodden, exhibiting the signs of many feet, both bare and booted. It crosses the inlet of the 
lake on a shaky bridge of rope and planks affixed by iron rods to the berm. The berm serves to protect the mushrooms from being inundated with too much effluent and water, and serves as a rough barrier to the trolls living at 9-8. It also allows both quicklings and larger creatures to move more swiftly through the muck field. 

Resting on the southernmost tip of the berm is a crude wicker cage containing 3 baindara. They are hungry and will bond easily with rescuers.

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the berm will be inundated by the water that is released from the drowned canyon. After 7-10 hours, this area will drain, leaving a layer of sticky muck on a much-weakened berm.

3 baindara (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 8; MV 150’, 150’ gliding; HD 1-1; HP 3, 3, 2; #AT 1; Dmg 1-2.

### 9-10: Sluice Gate

A small sluice gate rests here, where the inlet to the lake meets the quicklings’s main effluent canal. The gate is made a piece of repurposed rudishva plasteel set into grooves in two heavy wooden posts. Although the gate itself is not miniature, the apparatus that controls it is: a small crank some 1’ in diameter is used to raise or lower the gate. Closing the gate fully causes the effluent canals (see 9-5) to dry up, leaving stinking effluent to dry in place; the 
process of drying up takes about 2 hours. Opening the gate fully, however, floods the canals with relatively clean water from the lake. Within 6 turns the canals are flushed fully, and the cesspool (9-16) has grown in size. Adjusting the gate (and thus affecting the canals) is considered a provocation to the quicklings, who treat such interference as a casus belli. 

Four crocodiles lie patiently in wait for anyone who interacts with the sluice mechanism.

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the sluice gate will be swept away by the ensuing flood. After 7-10 hours, this area will drain, leaving a layer of sticky muck where the gate once stood. It will take the quicklings 5-7 days to replace the sluice, during which period they will be grumpy and hostile.

4 crocodiles: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 3; HP 22, 18, 17, 16; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/1-12. Special attacks: surprise on 1-3.

### 9-11: Greater Seat of Contemplation

A rudishva seat of contemplation sits atop this levelled rock promontory that rises 25’ above the floor of the mushroom grove. The seat of the chair is 4’ tall and is 5’ wide and deep. The back of the chair rises another 6’ in height. The seat and arms of the chair are worn, as if by use. Incised into the chair are two large (2’) symbols or runes, one on the seat and one on the back. The sigil on the seat is the rune for Sight; that on the back is a rune of Communication. The runes are activated by the close proximity of living flesh. Anyone touching or sitting on the seat will thus activate both runes. It is possible to cover one or both of the runes with an appropriate object and then employ the chair normally. 

Rune of Sight: The rune allows the viewer perfect vision within the chasm and areas of Level 9 connected to the chasm. That is, one can thoroughly investigate most of the chasm by sitting in this seat. The effect of this vision takes some time to get used to, as it can be nausea-inducing to swoop virtually up and down the chasm; there is a 50% chance that a user will vomit within 3 rounds of activating the rune. The rune is also dangerously attractive to human minds, and users will find it difficult to relinquish the swooping vision it produces. After a turn of use, the user must save vs spells in order to voluntarily leave the seat. If the save is failed, another may be attempted in 6 hours. Someone so ensnared by the seat will feel a great compulsion to return to the seat and use it again. A few of the old rudishva regions of the chasm are cloaked from the sight of the Chair, including the Floating Gardens (6-4 and 7-4), area 6-99, and area 9-88; a user will see these areas as impenetrable clouds of 
roiling darkness. Note that the chair provides perfect vision, as if the chasm was well lit. The chair does not, of course, reveal secret doors or hidden passageways. Complete scans of the chasm will take many days to accomplish.

Rune of Communication:  This rune activates a three-dimensional, full-immersion communication channel to the control niche (9-89) in the rudishva bastion. The image of whoever sits in the chair appears on the control panel, and the sitter is able to speak directly 
to any operator in the niche. The idea was that a rudishva who had been outside in the ‘wilds’ could request the opening of the door at 9-88 and the temporary disabling of the point defense arrays there. Of course, there needs to be someone present in 9-89 to actually accomplish this request. 

### 9-12: Buried Colossal Statue 

The top half of a buried stone head looms forth from the mushrooms and humus here. The head is flat and amphibian in features, with no ears, huge saucer-shaped eyes, and a slit nose. Only the upper lip of what must be a gaping maw is visible above the loam. If checked, the statue detects as evil.

The head is actually the tip of a colossal, 50’-tall statue that has been mostly buried by the accumulation of humus over the millennia. Carved by the heqeti into an enormous stone pillar (40’ in diameter at the base, 10’ in diameter at the top), the statue was the model for the Great Pukel (see 9-40) and the other, lesser pukel-manders (see new magic items) scattered throughout Arden Vul.  It would require massive labor or powerful spells to clear away the loam around the statue (an act which would also provoke total war with the quicklings – see 9-14). Should it be accomplished, however, the rest of the statue appears as a giant worm-like thing, albeit with the feet of an elephant and the arms and hands of a human. It is, in fact, a crude depiction of the demon lord Kauket (see new monsters). 

Nestled in the statue’s arms (and buried 20’ down) is the founder’s mattock, (see new magic items), a lost heqeti artifact. It could be traded to the heqeti in return for 20,000 gp worth of gems and an assurance of neutrality (as the heqeti will never be true allies of any human). Doing so, however, should be considered an evil act, as possession of the mattock would greatly aid the heqeti.

Destroying the statue, either physically with implements or magically via a spell or device (e.g., the spell stone to earth), weakens any incarnation of Kauket brought to this plane (see 10-37). Casting a hallow spell (see new spells) on the statue serves the same function.

Treasure:
The founder’s mattock (see new magic items).

### 9-13: Mushroom Drying Cave 

A network of ropes crisscrosses the ceiling of this two-lobed cave. From the ropes hang scores of colossal mushrooms harvested by the quicklings in the groves (9-4). Five bundles of every species found in the groves are drying here (each bundle contains 6 doses of that variety).

Two quicklings are always present here, buzzing about to ensure their operation is working smoothly. Should combat break out, all inhabitants of 9-14 will arrive within 2 rounds.

The entry to 9-13A is a 3’-diameter hole in the ground of the north lobe of this cave.

Barred Door (north): The door to the north is small (3’x4’) and barred on the other side (9-14). A successful bend bars/lift gates roll can force the door from this side. 

2 quicklings: SZ S; AL CE; AC -3; MV 960’; HD 1 ½; HP 10, 9; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-4. Special defenses: save as 19th-level clerics; never surprised; 90% invisible when moving, 100% when motionless; impossible to surprise. Special: ventriloquism, forget, levitate, shatter, dig, and fire charm. There is a 33% chance that any given quickling has coated his/her dagger with spider venom. One has 2-4 skulls filled with acid (2-8 HP, 1 HP splash) 
attached to his/her belt.

Treasure:
50 bundles of dried mushrooms (6 doses per bundle).

##### 9-13a: Quickling Ossuary

The tunnel connecting this side cave to 9-13 is quite small, only 3’ in diameter.

The cave is wide, but has a low (4’ ceiling). Carefully stacked throughout most of the cave are the tiny (2.5”-diameter) bleached skulls of hundreds of quicklings. The quickling tribe (9-14) preserves the skulls of its forebears and honors them with placement here.

The east side of the cave contains a healthy colony of mucus-like snottites, which drip acid into a pool on the floor. The acid is strong, and those brushing against the snottites will take 2-8 HP damage (per round).

The quicklings make use of the acid to give them a fighting chance against the varumani. They coat the insides of their forebears’ skulls with special concoction of mud and effluent 
(derived from 9-7 and 9-16); then they fill the skulls with acid. Thrown against a target, these acid-skull bombs inflict 2-8 HP damage, with a 1 HP splash. The process of making the acid bombs is laborious, so not all quicklings possess them.

### 9-14: Hall of the Quicklings

* the quicklings are mutated grimalkin, estranged from the temple of Bast, who they feel could not protect them during the fall of the city, now worshipping Atlach-Nacha, the spider god, who has granted them magics and the ability to speak to his children the giant spiders.  I return they give him sacrifices.
	* They have grown spindly and stunted (even smaller than normal grimalkin) and look emaciated

Rí Mear, lord of the quicklings, presides over his tribe from this hidden chamber. Only accessible from the network of tunnels that riddle the loam under the mushroom groves, the 8’-tall chamber offers a gruesome prospect to those who make it through the tunnels. A pile of dried mushrooms burns continuously in the center of the hall, shedding dim light on the splashes of blood that coat the walls. 

A ledge 2’ above the floor runs along the east and west walls of the chamber; it is here that quicklings perch for rest, relaxation, and drinking. 

The north wall possesses a single 5’x5’ ledge. There sits Rí Mear’s throne of skulls, a dreadful thing made of ancient human and heqeti skulls bound together with strips of dried flesh. 
Concealed in one of the skulls is the key to the secret door. This ledge also holds the quicklings’s stock of spider poison, which they use to coat their tiny daggers. Rí Mear doles it out sparingly.

To the south are some low tables crammed with bottles, small kegs, and wine flasks containing a bewildering assortment of liquors, ales, and other spirits. The floor around the liquor tables is littered with old bones, the remains of those unwary individuals who made it through the tunnels only to meet a sad fate in the quicklings’s hall.

The Quicklings: This band numbers 30 individuals, of which only ten plus Rí Mear are typically found in this chamber (the rest are out in the tunnels). The band is confident and cocky, as their situation in the tunnels has allowed them to thrive in the shadow of putatively 
stronger beings. They do value their small-scale but steady trade in mushrooms with the varumani, which provides them with liquors and other luxuries, but they treat all others with casual contempt. They are likely to torment and harass visitors to the mushroom groves in a regular fashion, although that harassment grows to open and total warfare if the groves are harmed in any way. Rí Mear has established an uneasy alliance with the giant spiders whose webs fill the space above much of the mushroom groves. In return for the quicklings informing the spiders of the arrival of juicy morsels, the giant spiders provide a limited quantity of venom.

Rí Mear (“King Quick”): As the largest (2.5’ tall) and strongest of the quicklings, Rí Mear has ruled the band successfully for an amazing 15 years. He is ruthless and pitiless, preferring to direct his followers in guerilla warfare against any perceived threats rather than negotiate. Only if somehow confronted in his own hall by clearly superior forces will he agree to halt harassment, and then only grudgingly (although once given, his word is good). 

Secret Door (north): A tiny (3’x3’), stone, secret door leads to a room in which the quicklings store their treasure. It is normal to detect (although all the quicklings know of it), and opens to the proper key (concealed in the throne) or to force. 

Barred Door (south): This stone door is 3’x4’ in size and is barred with an oaken plank from this side.

Rí Mear, quickling lord: SZ S; AL CE; AC -3; MV 960’; HD 4 ½; HP 30; #AT 3; Dmg 2-5/2-5/2-5. Special defenses: save as 19th-level clerics; never surprised; 90% invisible when moving, 100% when motionless; impossible to surprise. Special: ventriloquism, forget, levitate, shatter, dig, and fire charm. His dagger is coated with spider venom, and he carries 3 skulls filled with acid (2-8 HP, 1 HP splash).

10 quicklings: AL CE; SZ S, AC -3; MV 960’; HD 3(x2), 1 ½(x8); HP 22, 19, 11, 10, 10, 9(x3), 8, 7; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-3. Special defenses: save as 19th-level clerics; never surprised; 90% invisible when moving, 100% when motionless; impossible to surprise. Special: ventriloquism, forget, levitate, shatter, dig, and fire charm. At least three of the ten have weapons coated in 
giant-spider venom; there is a 33% chance that each of the other seven have followed suit. Three have 2-4 skulls filled with acid (2-8 HP, 1 HP splash) attached to their belts.

Treasure:
Alcohol: most of the liquor is of modest quality (20 containers worth 5-500 sp each). There are three kegs of Hak’s mushroom ale (see 7-94) worth 15 gp each, as well as three bottles of ancient Archontean brandy worth 225 gp each.

Spider venom: Rí Mear possesses 20 doses of giant spider venom.Treasure chamber: the floor is littered with coins (17,492 sp, 3,451 gp) and precious stones. The stones are collectively worth 12,000 gp, and include 15 moss agates (10 gp each), 22 pieces of obsidian (10 gp each) 13 tiger eyes (10 gp each), 23 citrines (50 gp each), 6 iolites (50 gp each), 17 tourmalines (50 gp each), 7 pieces of jade (100 gp each), 2 aquamarines (500 gp each), 
3 violet garnets (500 gp each), an emerald (1,000 gp), and a jacinth (5,000 gp). Scattered amid the coins and gems are the following (see new magic items for all): two glass spheres of arcane assistance (dispelling and martial warding), a pair of gauntlets of fire absorption, a heqeti ring, an icon of Kauket, and a jade cup of life restoration with 2 charges.

### 9-15: Quickling Tunnels

A bewildering network of small tunnels runs through the 40’-deep loam that forms the bed of the southern mushroom groves. The tunnels are only 3’ in diameter, and include vertical shifts in elevation, intersections, slight widenings, dead ends, and plenty of old bones sticking out the loam. The tunnels are present everywhere there are mushrooms, that is, between the berm (9-9) and the cesspool (9-16). Scores of tiny concealed holes (2’ diameter) lead from the floor of the groves to the tunnel network; these holes are typically concealed by fallen mushroom ribs, detrital mats woven of discarded giant spider silk, or something similar. The quicklings use their tremendous speed to dash through the tunnels, either to 
access to a portion of the groves for fungi maintenance or to harass unwanted visitors (and most are unwanted!). 

Several strike teams composed of 4-6 quicklings are present in the tunnels at all times, ready to burst forth from the nearest access hole. A strike team typically spends 2-3 rounds tormenting its foes before dashing back into an access hole. They then wait for the victims to move before repeating the procedure.

Should appropriately-sized PCs enter the tunnels, they will find the strike teams equally willing to attack lead characters in turn, hoping to reduce the invaders’ strength by attrition (and, hopefully, by the successful use of the spider venom that some of the quicklings employ). Should small-sized PCs overcome these odds, it will still take 6-12 turns of claustrophobic crawling through the tunnels before the entrance to the quicklings’s hall (9-14) is discovered. 

Up to 16 quicklings in strike teams of 4-6 individuals: AL CE; SZ S (2’), AC -3; MV 960’; HD 3(x2), 1 ½ (x14); HP 22, 19, 11(x3), 10(x3), 9(x4), 8, 8, 7, 7; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-4. Special defenses: save as 19th-level clerics; never surprised; 90% invisible when moving, 100% when motionless; impossible to surprise. Special: ventriloquism, forget, levitate, shatter, dig, and fire charm. There is a 33% chance that any given quickling has coated his/her dagger with spider venom. One member of each team has 2-4 skulls filled with acid (2-8 HP, 1 HP splash) attached to his/her belt.

## Level 9: 16 - 30

### 9-16: Cesspool

The more liquid parts of the effluent that falls to the bottom of the chasm and is channeled through the quicklings’s canals (9-5) collect here in a foetid pool. The odor is palpable from 50’ away. Two quicklings, long inured to the stench, flit about the pool, using long bamboo skimmers to rescue anything small and interesting-looking. If bothered, one quickling zooms away to bring help while the other harasses the violators.

Their meager cache of valuables is deposited under a fallen mushroom cap.

Entering the pool provokes a 20% chance of catching a disease, although those doing so may discover a submerged tunnel leading to area 9-24.

GM Note: Vertical spider webs span the mouth of the southern lobe of the cavern leading to the cesspool (see 9-4) and horizontal webs cover the space above the grove and pit. For every turn spent near the pit there is a cumulative 10% chance of attracting the attention of 2-4 giant spiders. The spiders do not bother the quicklings.

2 quicklings: SZ S; AL CE; AC -3; MV 960’; HD 1 ½; HP 8, 7; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-4. Special defenses: save as 19th-level clerics; never surprised; 90% invisible when moving, 100% 
when motionless; impossible to surprise. Special: ventriloquism, forget, levitate, shatter, dig, and fire charm. There is a 33% chance that any given quickling has coated his/her dagger with spider venom. One has 2-4 skulls filled with acid (2-8 HP, 1 HP splash) attached to his/her belt.

2-4 giant spiders (possibly): see stats at 9-17.

Treasure:
13 sp, 7 gp, a silver fibula studded with onyx (35 gp), and a single pearl earring (125 gp).

### 9-17: Spider Cave

The two entrances to this cave lie 15’ above the floor of the mushroom forest. A tribe of eight giant spiders lives here and in the webs in the surrounding areas of the great cavern (see 9-4). The leader of the tribe goes by the name ‘Fang’ and is a bit larger than her fellows. The cave is filled with webs and the dried up husks of the spiders’ prey. In the southern tip of the cave is a partly-concealed opening, only 3’ in diameter, to another cave (9-18) that the spiders do not visit.

The spiders prefer to hunt in the chasm, but do not object if prey comes to them. They are aggressive until confronted with overwhelming force, at which point they flee into the webs, the mushroom groves, or their cave-lair.

If members of the tribe are encountered and slain elsewhere (c.f. 9-4 or 9-16), they should be subtracted from the total here.

Inhabitants:
‘Fang’, larger leader of the giant spiders: SZ L; AL CE; AC 2 MV 60’, 120’ in web; HD 6+6; HP 47; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: poison (save at -2).

7 giant spiders: SZ L; AL CE; AC 4; MV 30’, 120’ in web; HD 4+4; HP 35, 34, 33, 29, 27, 25, 24; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: poison.

Treasure:
473 sp, 299 gp, two suits of human-sized chain mail, a medium metal shield +1, and an illusionist’s spell book. Spell Book: Audible glamer, color spray, dancing lights, darkness, gaze reflection, hypnotism, light, phantasmal force; blur, deafness, detect magic, hypnotic pattern, improved phantasmal force, mirror image, misdirection; continual light, dispel illusion, fear, paralysation, spectral force, suggestion; confusion, dispel exhaustion, emotion, 
massmorph, phantasmal killer; chaos, major creation, maze, shadow door, shadow magic.

### 9-18: Hidden Cave

Accessible only via a 3’-diameter opening in the southernmost portion of 9-17, this cave is unremarkable save for the corpse of Ketra Jiran, a dead human illusionist. She was the companion and lover of Erist Ellagelsson, princeling of the elven kingdom of Gallador (see SL6-5). She was overwhelmed by the spiders while looking for way to help Erist escape from his current fate. She managed to crawl into this cave before dying from the spider venom. By her corpse are two battered backpacks and other gear.

Treasure:
3 Arden Vul cakes (see Arden Vul items), 2 fully-charged rudishva lesser power supplies (see new technological items), a pair of boots of insulation, three darts of sleeping, a lover’s token (keyed to Erist Ellagelsson – see SL6-5), a potion of dispelling (see new magic items for the last four), and a rod of absorption (with 33 spell levels in it).

### 9-19: Warning Cave

The cave is damp, with dripping water, numerous stalactites and stalagmites, and a healthy growth of furry green lichen. Two ‘scarecrows’ stand in the center of the cave, facing the exit into the chasm. One is a human adventurer, stripped of all gear save a loincloth, and tied to a triangular frame of wood. The other is a goblin, tied to a similar but smaller frame. Around the neck of each is hung a wooden shingle with the phrase “No Entry!” in Varumani. The human is dead, but only recently so, as the chasm insects are still feasting on his body. The goblin is still alive, but only barely so. His name is Baradim, and he is neither powerful nor significant. Still, King Weskenim (SL4-22) will be grateful for his return to the Goblin Warrens (to the tune of offering a reward of 500 sp); alternately, Baradim might volunteer his services as a guide and general dogsbody to his new friends. 

The varumani miners placed the poor individuals here in the hopes they would deter the curious or hungry from moving into the silver mine area (9-21 to 9-28). 

GM Note: The opening to the chasm lies 5’ above the layer of humus on which the mushrooms grow.

Baradim the goblin: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 5; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6..

### 9-20: Empty Cave

This cave contains nothing of interest save the desiccated husk of a giant spider.

### 9-21: Varumani Guard Post

An 8’-tall masonry wall bisects this 20’-tall cave; it runs from the north to south side. Six true varumani warriors (see new monsters) stand on a firing ledge on the east side of the wall. Armed with heavy crossbows, spears, and battle axes, they are tasked with preventing unwanted visitors from entering the silver mine area (areas 9-22 to 9-28). Although bored, the varumani refuse to negotiate with anyone; indeed, they are eager to fight. They have a keg of Hak’s ale (7-94), a rickety wooden ladder, two sides of smoked goat meat, as well as a low table with a set of seventeen dice of mixed origin; among the dice is a silver set of Banion’s dice (see new magic items). Should combat break out, the inhabitants of area 9-22 will arrive in 3-6 rounds to aid them; the miners in area 9-21 also have a 33% chance of hearing the sounds of combat and arriving within 6-8 rounds. 

6 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62, 60, 59, 56, 53, 50; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed axe, 2-20+4). Special defenses: 
surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: two-handed axes; heavy crossbows; ring mail.

Treasure:
A keg of ale (50 gp), and a silver set of Banion’s dice (see new magic items).

### 9-22: Mine Boss

This cave is brightly lit by four torches and serves as the headquarters of the varumani silver mining operation. Within are six hammocks, a rack containing picks, shovels, and wooden 
buckets, four kegs of Hak’s ale (see 7-94), a dozen sides of smoked goat meat, and an unused rudishva greater power supply (see new technological items). Against the flattish south wall is a man-sized straw dummy, which the varumani use for target practice. Typically the true varumani overseer of the mining operation, Prayaska, hangs about here with her advisor, Lithiric the Talker, killing time and planning how to enrich herself. There is a 33% chance that two miners are also present, resting in their hammocks.

GM Notes: Prayaska is a proud and extremely venal member of clan Rudigaya. She is so proud, in fact, that she eschews actual mining, preferring to boss her fellows about. Her venality is well known to Varboka the thegn (7-30), but Varboka believed that her greed could be turned to the benefit of the People by ensuring maximum output from the silver mine. The thegn did not count on the evil influence of Lithiric, however. Lithiric insinuated himself into Prayaska’s favor and has been slowly playing up the latter’s greed; it was Lithiric who suggested that Prayaska begin holding back some portion of the smelted silver as her own ‘due’. Lithiric is, in fact, an agent of High Priestess Stephania of the cult of Set (4-51), sent to the thegn’s court to sow dissension; by playing on Prayaska’s greed, he hopes to be able to divert an increasing quantity of the mined silver to his mistress on Level 4. Lithiric has 
also been charmed by Cinna Minux (7-122), and is unaware that the vampire is fully aware of the existence of the mine as well as Lithiric’s political machinations. Despite his treacherous plans, Lithiric fights bravely alongside his varumani ‘friends’ so as to preserve Set’s influence in this area.

Prayaska, female true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 1; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (club, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 
in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: a huge, polished rosewood war club; six javelins; a torc of protection (see new magic items) worn as an arm band; and pouch of capacity (see new magic items). The pouch contains 25 lb of pure silver, skimmed from the smelting operation in 9-26.

Lithiric the Talker, 7th-level male Thorcin magic user: SZ M; AL CE; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 21; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (dagger). Abilities: STR 9, INT 16, WIS 15, DEX 15, CON 9, CHA 10. 
Possessions: a bandolier of daggers; a ring of protection +2; a scroll case of potency (see new magic items) in which he has placed one of his three scrolls of fireball; a bag of holding 
(70 cubic feet variety) containing 500 sp and 155 lb of pure silver; and a wand of lightning (11 charges). Memorized spells: burning hands, charm person, friends, shield; continual 
light, invisibility, mirror image; dispel magic, suggestion; wall of fire. 

2 bestial varumani (see new monsters) (33%): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 53, 49; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; immune to poison.

Treasure:
Three kegs of Hak’s ale (50 gp each); personal treasure on the two bosses; Lithiric’s spell book.

Lithiric’s Spell Book: Burning hands, charm person, comprehend languages, detect magic, friends, identify, jump, light, magic missile, read magic, shield, sleep; audible glamer, continual light, detect invisibility, invisibility, mirror image; dispel magic, fireball, phantasmal force, protection from normal missiles, slow, suggestion; charm monster, fire shield, fumble, remove curse, wall of fire, wizard eye, distance distortion.

### 9-23: Silver Mine, Main Seam

A rich seam of pure silver runs through the rock in this area. The sound of picks and mauls echoes throughout, as the varumani have seized the area and are mining it. The main seam averages 20’ in width and 15’-25’ in height; torches set into sconces every 25’ provide light. Numerous side tunnels (e.g. 9-28) have been dug off the main seam. Wooden scaffolding is erected here and there throughout the seam, on top of which 6-8 lesser and bestial varumani miners are always hard at work with pickaxes, mauls, shovels, and wooden buckets. 

While the main seam still produces ore (about 18 lb of raw ore and 3 lb of silver per day), it is clear that the easy days of mining in the wide main seam are nearing their end. Already the section of the seam nearest area 9-26 is played out, and the miners are piling up their tailings along the west wall there. Within three months the eastern arm of the main seam will also be played out, and the miners will need to start the more difficult work of delving new seams, in the direction of area 9-28 for instance. 

Unless visitors are obviously hostile, the miners ignore all those who appear to have legitimate business in the area. If a fight breaks out at area 9-21, there is only a 33% chance that the miners hear it and move to investigate.

4 lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 59, 58, 53, 49; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

2 or 4 bestial varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 53, 50, 49, 48; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; immune to 
poison.

Treasure:
The miners have collected 36 lb of un-smelted raw ore.

### 9-24: Smelly Cave 

A foul smell emerges from the pool located in the center of this cave. The water in the pool is strangely colored (brownish) and contains little bits of biological material. This fact is explained by the existence of a subterranean tunnel that connects the pool to the effluent pit (9-16). Entering the submerged tunnel provokes a chance for catching disease (20% chance). A tarnished silver statuette depicting Rimmaq-Isfet (see new monsters) may be found inside the tunnel.

Treasure:
Silver statuette of Rimmaq-Isfet (250 gp).

### 9-25: Cave with Hole

The silver in this extension from the main seam has played out. A 5’-diameter hole drops down 15’ to a tunnel leading to area 9-19. The varumani are aware of the hole, but don’t consider it a threat.

### 9-26: Smelting Operation

This cave is where the varumani smelt their silver ore into pure silver. The smelting is accomplished via an ancient rudishva relic: a CRUD-Ore 7500 ore processing machine (see new technological items). This piece of technology is powered by a greater rudishva power supply (see new technological items), and can distil 1 lb of pure metal from 6 lb of ore in about a turn. The power supply is good for another month of operation before becoming fully drained. Originally several other dials existed which allowed an operator to fine-tune the production and consistency of the metallic output; at the moment, the output consists of rock slag and a soft, amorphous mass of raw silver. Once smelted, the miners lug the silver up the tunnels to be smithed in the forge (7-68).

Geldaka, a mute lesser varumani, works the smelter under the direction of Prayaska (9-22).

GM Note: Prayaska and Lithiric have been skimming smelted silver from the operation. Geldaka is aware of their thievery, but has chosen to do nothing about it, mainly because he is unable to speak. 

Geldaka, mute lesser varumani smelter (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

Treasure:
At any given time there is a 50% chance for 50 lb of smelted silver to be present here; otherwise the stocks are empty.

### 9-27: Tunnel up to 7-52

This tunnel is narrow and cramped. Its size is a sore point for the varumani miners, who must crouch and scramble to return to the thegn’s court (Level 7). The tunnel wends its way upwards before debouching at area 7-52. 

### 9-28: Narrow Silver Vein

This narrow tunnel follows the most promising silver vein branching off the main seam. At its northern end the tunnel is 7’ tall and 4’ wide, but it tapers to 4’ tall and 3’ wide at its southern end. The silver seam is quite rich here, and the varumani will develop it as the new source of their silver mining operations. At the moment, Prayaska is using this location to store the proceeds of her graft.

Treasure:
Prayaska has stored 150 lb of smelted silver under a rock-colored tarp at the end of this tunnel. Unless PCs physically search the end of the tunnel, the tarp must be detected as a secret door.

### 9-29: Rudishva Doors and Hallway

The door to the chasm floor (9-1) is a rudishva iris door, and can only be opened if a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items) is held against a yellow rectangle inset into the doors. The door is also buried under 20’ of accumulated humus from the mushroom groves. 

The rudishva iris door leading to the Great Pillar (9-30) is of an unusual sort; it is not opened in the usual manner, by presenting a colored rudishva identity plaque. Instead, it requires a special key to unlock. The lock is extremely complex (-40% to pick). The troll thegn (7-30) and the Arena Lord (6-85) each possess a key. The keys are 1’-long, 3”-diameter, grey plasteel rods with a notched, 1”-tall flange on each end. The door is also enchanted with the 
equivalent of a wizard lock cast at 12th level.

Lying in the hallway are two desiccated corpses of varuda, still dressed in their orange jumpsuits. Bronze and pale-green rudishva identity plaques may be found on the corpses.

### 9-30: Great Pillar

From this location, the rudishva great pillar may be used to ascend to Levels 5, 6, and 7 (areas 5-138, 6-103 and 7-37). The walls of the shaft, as well as the 30’-diameter pillar itself, are formed of perfectly smooth black granite. The walls of the shaft were treated by kaliyani techno-sorcerers with a unique form of anti-magic resistance, largely to protect unwanted burrowing into this important site. Although magic will work within the shaft, magical breaches of the shaft walls are almost impossible.

Inset into the floor of the shaft are four 6’-diameter circular fans made of plasteel. These marvels are still working several thousand years after their installation, and serve to pump fresh air from a hidden cave system into the pillar shaft. The cave system is unmapped, and provides an opportunity for expansion should the GM wish it.

A set of hand- and footholds are cut into the Pillar; this precarious ‘ladder’ ascends the Pillar in a clockwise spiral. It is thus possible, although highly impractical, to climb the Pillar by hand and foot. Several rolls of 5d6 under STR and/or DEX are necessary for anyone so foolhardy as to climb all the way to the top of the Pillar (5-138).

For a general overview of the pillar, see area 5-138. 

## Level 9: 31 - 45

### 9-31: Broken Heqeti Connector

A heqeti causeway once linked area 9-40 to the ridge at 9-2. In antiquity that span was broken in two places, one near area 9-2 and the other closer to 9-38. Although the connector is in places a corridor, carved out of solid rock, in other places it became a thin bridge of stone that extended above open spaces below. The northern tip of the causeway is one such bridge, as it extends from the cavern wall 40’ above the floor; sadly, the last bit of the bridge that linked it to area 9-2 has collapsed, leaving a 15’-wide gap between the ridge and the connector. The other bridge segment comes to the south, where the connector crosses area 9-33; here the bridge is intact and floats 50’ above the floor of the cave below. 
In addition to the main causeway, a side bridge once extended to the stairs at 9-36; the central portions of that bridge collapsed eons ago. As with all heqeti construction, the bridge is slightly rough or pebbled on its surfaces, and still retains a faint oily sheen.

Originally the connector boasted a pair of 4’-diameter free-standing columns every 10’ (much like area 5-6), but most of them were toppled long ago. The extant portions of the connector are littered with broken bits of column, fallen stalactites, and ancient heqeti, varumani, and varuda skeletons.

The Priscians have established a concealed encampment on the causeway, in the section of roofed corridor between the open areas at 9-2 and 9-33. This base camp is intended to guard their newly-discovered route to Level 7 (i.e., the route from 9-41 to 7-64). As is their wont everywhere, these Priscians prefer to remain hidden if possible, only taking action if visitors discover their camp or the tunnel at 9-41. 

The camp is concealed by an hallucinatory terrain spell cast by Cenwulf, the leader of the Priscians. Visitors will see an empty corridor littered with broken bits of column, fallen stalactites, and a broken orange lamp mushroom that gives off some low phosphorescence. In reality, the camp is 20’ in diameter and includes a camp fire, 10 bedrolls, a small keg of water, and 4 chests with supplies. The conversi thieves are also invisible, even when relaxing. The one thing that Cenwulf cannot (or will not) conceal fully is noise; those listening carefully may well detect sounds of breathing, slight movements, or shifting gear.

If discovered, the Priscians first attempt to render any visitors helpless via backstabs and disabling magic. If the PCs offer negotiation or surrender, though, the Priscians are willing to listen, provided the PCs swear to depart from this section of Level 9. They might even offer a bribe of up to 200 gp/head to induce the PCs to depart. Should the PCs agree, the Priscians will appear pleased; but will soon shift their camp to area 9-38 and double the guard, since 
they fully expect the PCs to return with a vengeance.

Treasure:
In addition to the personal items on the Priscians, the chests contain some valuables:

Chest #1: this chest contains the spell books of the mages, plus 3 scrolls of detect magic, and 2 scrolls of knock.

Chest #2: a pile of silver and copper coins to be used as bribes. 1,319 sp, 456 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), and 8,901 cp.

Chest #3: enough dried meat, dried vegetables and dried fruit for a dozen people for a week. In addition, 10 Arden Vul cakes (see Arden Vul items), and a 3-lb bag of nuts.

Chest #4: 2 lb of silver dust (5 gp); a pair of solid gold finials shaped like storks (330 gp each); an elaborate carved ivory box with scenes from Archontean military history (450 gp); 6 vials of sweet-smelling incense, a solid lead andiron shaped like a terrier (45 gp), a set of eight carved silver weights used in draftsmanship to hold parchment in place (35 gp each), and 3 10-lb bars of platinum (2,500 gp each). 

### 9-32: Bone Slope

This corner of the great cavern slopes downward precipitously, losing 10’ in elevation before merging with area 9-33. The slope is littered with bones from all manner of creature: human (ancient Archontean), heqeti, varumani, varuda, small animals, and even a few kaliyani. Although the presence of these bones may suggest the nearby lair of a fearsome predator, their presence here is actually due to the quicklings, who toss any bones that they discover while digging their tunnels (9-15) onto this slope. The bones do make traversing the slope rather difficult; characters other than thieves must roll 3d6 under DEX or slide down the slope, taking 1-2 HP damage in the process. Those employing light or making noise (such as that caused by sliding down the slope) automatically alert the Priscians at area 9-31.

### 9-33: Deep Cave beneath the Causeway

The floor of this cave lies 50’ beneath the ancient heqeti causeway (9-31). It is littered with piles of broken stone, some of which still contain recognizable shapes – like shattered column drums, bits of broken pediment, and the headless, limbless torsos of three heqeti 
statues. Amid the debris are numerous skeletons, most of which are ancient and appear to be heqeti or human in origin. To the west end of the cave are two corpses of more modern vintage, still wearing some equipment: these corpses are riddled with strange bone arrows (heqeti arrows) and appear to have been scorched rather badly.

Searching among the debris may turn up some item of interest. For every turn spent searching, roll on the following chart. Up to six items may be found. Creating noise in the western portion of the cave (by, say, searching) brings Tashiblis from 9-34 and awakens the undead heqeti at 9-36 (see new monsters for both).

The tunnel to 9-37 is located 10’ above the floor of the eastern edge of the cavern.

### 9-34: Cave of Tashiblis

This ‘cave’ is separated from area 9-33 by a narrow, 8’-wide opening between two huge piles of rubble. If examined, the rubble is easily shown to be the remains of the stone bridge that once connected 9-36 and 9-31. It is clear both that the rubble has been consciously piled up so as to close off 9-34 and that the extant entrance to 9-34 was formed by something pushing into 9-33 from within 9-34. That ‘something’ is a dreadful animated construct known to the heqeti as Tashiblis (see new monsters). Noise or light in the western areas of 9-33 brings Tashiblis stumping to the attack (and wakens the undead heqeti at 9-36).

Background: Tashiblis is a rudishva animated construct (stone nataraja) (see new monsters) that was abandoned during the rudishva collapse and ‘repurposed’ by the clever heqeti builder, Hossqip. Hossqip was a hero of the rudishva wars, and accomplished many impressive magical feats, including taking control of the animated construct and infusing it with some impressive offensive and defensive features. It guarded area 9-36 until the Archontean wars, when the stone bridge was destroyed and the Archontean magi barricaded it into area 9-34. Eventually it dug its way out of the rubble and now continues in its guard duties even in the absence of its heqeti masters. 

Tashiblis (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 1; MV 120’; HD 8+8; HP 62; #AT 1; Dmg 4-11; MR 35%. Special attacks: sonic stun; small fireballs (4-24 damage); rainbow bolts (drain spells from target), breath weapon - fire (5-30 damage). Special defenses: +2 weapons or better weapons to hit.

### 9-35: Tunnel Up to 5-52b

This tunnel climbs a very long way through the rock (some 1,100’) before ending up on Level 5, at area 5-52B. Although mostly natural, the tunnel does contain sections of worked corridors and stair segments, all of which have the familiar pebbled and slightly oily texture of heqeti construction.

Note: If the keqemander demon (see new monsters) has been summoned at area 5-52 and has not been defeated, there is a chance it may be present here or in one of the surrounding caves. See area 5-52 for details.

### 9-36: Heqeti Bridge Fragment and Stairs

Looming 50’ above the floor of area 9-34, this bridge fragment used to extend east to area 9-31. A set of stairs commences on the bridge and leads west. Originally this staircase climbed all the way to area 5-52, but it was destroyed in antiquity, leaving only the current 60’ fragment. The construction of the bridge and stairs is heqeti (pebbled and oily), and the stairs’ tread-to-rise ratio is uncomfortable for humans. 

Seven undead heqeti salamander warriors (see new monsters) lie in wait atop the bridge fragment. They are armed with short bows and poisoned arrows, and will employ their ranged weapons until out of ammunition, at which point they leap down to confront intruders. Very loud noise in area 9-33 might rouse them to action (33%), but they are certain to react if Tashiblis (9-34) enters melee.

7 heqeti hopping dead (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 3; HP 22, 21, 20, 19, 17, 16, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as ghasts; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells. They are armed with short bows and 15 poisoned arrows each. The poison is known to the heqeti as Kauket’s Vision, and is of a psychotropic sort that causes severe hallucinations to those who fail a save (see Arden Vul items).

### 9-37: Cave below the Heqeti Causeway

The floor of this large cave is 40’ below the edge of the heqeti causeway (9-38 and 9-40). The eastern edge of the cave has suffered numerous collapses and cave-ins; loose rubble and scree runs along that wall. The floor of the cave is uneven, dotted with piles of rubble including both worked and natural stone.

Given the geological instability here, any destructive magic (like fireball) cast in the area of 9-37 to 9-40 have a 75% chance of causing a pile of rocks to fall from the ceiling. The rockfall strikes an area that covers 3-6 10’x10’ squares. Those within the affected zone take 6-36 HP damage; thieves who save vs breath weapons take no damage, but others still take half damage.

Dwarves or rangers will notice signs of recent passage through the rubble fields, leading towards 9-41.

### 9-38: Rubble-Strewn Heqeti Causeway

This section of the long heqeti causeway that once linked 9-2 to 9-40 overlooks the cavern below (9-37). The way north is blocked by an impassable cave-in; the same appears to be the case to the south, although careful inspection reveals several narrow passages that lead through the debris to area 9-40. 

The west wall (running all the way to 9-40) boasts low relief carvings of heqeti, salamanders, frogs, and amphibian-like entities writhing in an interlocking, chaotic mass of limbs, tongues, and stabbing weapons. The scene is disturbing to look at, especially as the eyes of all the carvings are all hollow depressions about the size of a fist. Some ancient Mithric graffiti mars the carvings towards the north end; this graffiti is vulgar and coarse, with frequent mention of the hoppers and where they ought to hop.

At the moment this area is unoccupied. Should the Priscians at 9-31 be discovered, however, they will move their encampment to this area.

Secret Door (west): This door is difficult to locate (1 in 8 chance). It is unusually sized, taking the form of a writhing salamander, and can only be opened from this side by placing two tears of Kauket (see new magic items) in the eyeholes of that salamander. If this is done, the salamander-shaped door (about 3’ high and 7’ long) opens inward. 

### 9-39: Secret Staircase Leading Up to 6-112a

The very long staircase behind the secret door leads up to area 6-112A. It was one of the main routes used by the heqeti in their secret – and successful – strike against the rudishva. The steps are worn, pebbled and oily. The staircase is filled with cobwebs, insect husks, and random bits of leather and metal for most of its length.Secret Door (to 9-38): The door is easy to locate (1 in 4 chance). From this side it can only be opened by locating and depressing a small knob. 

### 9-40: The Great Pukel

A giant pukel-mander crouches here, at the southern end of the ancient heqeti causeway in a niche that is 30’ tall. Piles of rubble block views of the pukel from 9-37 or 9-38. The eastern edge of the pediment overlooking 9-37 has collapsed into the cave below; even non-thieves have a 33% chance of successfully scrambling up the scree. 

The Great Pukel:  Like its many lesser siblings scattered through-out Arden Vul, the Great Pukel appears as a massive, crouching salamander carved out of oily soapstone. Unlike the pukel-manders (see new magic items), however, the Great Pukel is 20’ tall and 15’ wide. The eyes are gaping holes, 5’ in diameter, while the toothless maw is 6’ across. Although the features of the pukel do not change, a low, chuffing laugh emerges constantly from its maw: “heh, heh, heh, heh”. The Pukel radiates evil.

Within each eyehole are 3-6 pure white tears of Kauket (see new magic items). These potent but dangerous items may be removed easily enough (in order, for instance, to use them 
to activate the secret door at 9-38) by characters of chaotic evil alignment. All others who remove a tear are punished for their blasphemy: the Pukel’s laugh changes to harsh shouts of anger, and two keqemandri (see new monsters) teleport in to punish the transgressors. 

The gaping maw of the Great Pukel is filled with a viscous clear liquid, none other than the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items). Up to 15 vials of the sweat may be filled from the maw. The supply of sweat gradually replenishes at a rate of 1 vial’s worth per month. The same alignment restrictions as concern the tears of Kauket apply here; two keqemandri teleport in if a non-chaotic evil being takes any of the sweat.

GM Note: the tears appear here when beings effect teleportation by means of the lesser pukel-manders. In such cases any pure white tear used in teleportation remains in the Great Pukel’s eyeholes; tears of other colors are destroyed in the teleportation. It is thus possible for the supply here to be replenished. If the PCs use the devices, then any white tear used will be found here; there is also a 5% chance per month that some other being will have used at least one white tear in a pukel-mander, and thus that a new tear will be present in the Great Pukel’s eyeholes.

Destroying the Great Pukel: It is difficult, but possible to destroy the Great Pukel, and doing so will have several effects on Arden Vul. For one, it will cancel the magical powers of the lesser pukel-manders scattered through Arden Vul; thereafter, the pukel-manders will merely appear as ominous, vaguely evil statues, with no special effects. More importantly, though, destroying the Great Pukel serves to weaken Rimmaq-Isfet and Kauket, thus evening the odds should PCs confront Kauket on Level 10 (see Level 10 introduction and 10-37). To destroy the Great Pukel, four spells must be cast in sequence within a span of 6 hours: spiritwrack or holy word, dispel magic (by a 12th- or greater-level caster), transmute rock to mud, and then hallow (see new spells). 

During the casting period(s), two more keqemandri will teleport in to defend the unholy Great Pukel. Of course, a single carefully-worded wish would also suffice.

2 or more keqemander demons (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC -2; MV 90’, 150’ flying (Class D); HD 16; HP 116, 101; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/3-18; MR 40%. Constant abilities: dread (-1 to saves); infravision. Special attacks: acid spit (3-10 dmg; 30’ range, every other round); cause fear; darkness (10’ radius); exude acid with chance to degrade armor; use a symbol 
of discord. Special defenses: only hit by magic weapons; half damage from cold, electricity, fire, and gas; become invisible. Special: levitate; telekinesis (4,000 gp weight); project image; 
teleport without error; 50% chance to gate in either another keqemander or a Type I-IV demon.

### 9-41: Tunnel up to 7-64

This tunnel snakes upward to join Level 7 at area 7-64. The Priscians recently discovered it and have dispatched a war mage triad up it (see areas 7-39 and 7-44). If lights are employed at the entrance of this tunnel, the Priscians at 9-31 will be alerted and will arrive within a turn to protect their colleagues on Level 7.

Trap (noise trap): A smiley face is painted on the tunnel wall 50’ below the point at which the tunnel arrives in area 7-44. The face is the trigger for a Frigg’s flatulence spell (see new spells) that the Priscians have installed there as a warning. If the spell is triggered by motion, the Priscians in 7-44 will be ready.

### 9-42: Debris-Strewn Cave

The same geological instability present in 9-37 is found here (see above for chances of collapse). The temperature is noticeably warmer, and the air moister. Although the cave surfaces are rough and natural, obvious bits of ancient worked stone protrude crazily from the floor and walls. These include bits of stairs, flattened pieces of pediment, and an occasional broken plinth. 

Lying in a pool of dried blood halfway down the cave is the corpse of an unusual being: a man-sized biped dressed in bulbous, puffy, quilted, yellow pants and coat. Within is the body of a spindly biped with a smooth, hairless body. Its eyes are pupil-less and of indeterminate color. Within its cold-weather gear it wears only a loincloth and four web-belts that were once stuffed with gear. The corpse is that of Harjot, a niravairi and a rissaldar in the Order of Planar Explorers (see new monsters). His body has a nasty gut wound and has been stripped of nearly all of its special equipment.

A ranger may be able to locate and track a subtle blood trail that leads south towards 9-43. The chance is 50% plus 5% for every level of experience over 3.

GM Note: The demonic huntsmen at 9-50 hunted Harjot and his companions, Bahula (see 9-50) and Vingelok (see 9-48), through the Astral Plane. The three members of the Order fled through the gate at 9-51, but were trailed by the huntsmen. Bahula was slain first, while Harjot was mortally wounded and succumbed to his injuries here. Vingelok still lives, wounded and desperate, deeper within the ruins.

Treasure:
Stuffed into a pouch on the web-belts is a 1-lb sack of gold flakes (50 gp), a 1-lb sack of silver flakes (50 sp), and 7 cork-sized plugs of pure platinum (weighing about 1 lb in total and worth 250 gp). Within the corpse’s loincloth is a small piece of crystal covered with spidery writing in the niravairi language; if deciphered with magic, it reads “Rissaldar! We have reason to believe Veshlok, the hero of the ancient Order, still lives, trapped in a time anomaly within the Astral. Your mission is to provide tactical support to the Havildar. Together you are to locate the missing Veshlok, probably at the arcanum mine on the hawk-headed corpse, and rescue him. May your karma be sufficient to merit success.” [GM: the note refers to the other members of the Order of Planar Explorers whose fate is detailed at SL1-11].

### 9-43: Stalactite Cave

This cave and the surrounding tunnels are very humid and warm. Scores of stalactites and stalagmites dot the area, many in beautiful shades of blue and green. Movement is slowed to half, and unless explorers look carefully, they might overlook the tunnel leading to 9-45. A ranger may be able to locate and track a subtle blood trail that leads south towards 9-45. The chance is 50% plus 5% for every level of experience over 3.

### 9-44: Tunnel Leading to SL13-32

This tunnel rises steeply before reaching the Lost Chambers of Arden at SL13-32.

### 9-45: Unstable, Wet Cave

This wet, humid cavern is also covered with stalagmites and stalactites. The cave exhibits the same geological instability as areas 9-37 and 9-42 (see 9-37 for chances of collapse). It will be clear to any casual observer that the cave once housed an area of worked stone, perhaps with a staircase. That worked area has been completely destroyed, however, and the cavern floor is now 30’ below the nearest worked area (9-46). Piles of debris litter the floor, and bits of pediment and broken stair risers are embedded in the extant cave surfaces. 

A ranger may be able to locate and track a subtle blood trail that leads east towards 9-47. The chance is 50% plus 5% for every level of experience over 3.

## Level 9: 46 - 57

### 9-46: Ancient Slime Pits

This worked area sits 30’ above the floor of 9-45 and features pebbled, oily surfaces like the rest of the heqeti architecture. Six pits, each 6’ in diameter and 3’ deep, are set into the floor of the chamber, while shattered stone benches rest against all the walls and piles of debris litter the floor. Amid the piles may be found stone chips, leather flasks, gourds, bits of unidentifiable dried mushroom, broken copper utensils, and small bits of flakey substances in a variety of colors. Two of the pits are coated with a long-dried precipitate, one of which is pale green and the other bright yellow. 

This was one of the original locations in which the heqeti experimented with brewing slimes, relying on the chaotic influence of dread Rimmaq-Isfet (see new monsters), and on the ingenuity of their builders.

Since the site was destroyed twice, first by the rudishva and again by the Archonteans, little of use remains. Still, the precipitates that remain in the pits could be rehydrated, thus creating two heqeti slimes (see new monsters). If the slimes are rehydrated in a closed receptacle (bottle or flask), they might be usable as thrown weapons. If rehydrated in situ, they act as foes. The GM can roll randomly or choose an appropriate slime.

More significantly, a foul ichor of Rimmaq-Isfet has been drawn here by the evil that still permeates the area. It is plastered to the ceiling, where it appears as a patch of black rock. Once living prey has come into range, it drops from above in an effort to consume the living. The ichor has no treasure. 

1 ichor of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 16 HD; HP 111; #AT 2; Dmg 1-6/1-6; MR 30%. Special attacks: caustic touch (1-4 HP acid damage); crush (1-10 HP/rd); obliterate organic matter. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold and acid.

1 rust-colored, watery heqeti slime (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 10’ creeping; HD 2; HP 14; #AT 1; Dmg special; MR 15%. Special attacks: consumes metal in one round (magic items get save); corrosive to leather. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold. Must be rehydrated with a gallon of water.

1 rust-colored, peanut-butter-like heqeti slime (see new mon-sters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 15’ pseudopod; HD 2; HP 7; #AT 1; Dmg special; MR 15%. Special attacks: poison (kills in 3-18 
days); corrosive to wood. Special defenses: healed by electricity, lasers; slowed by cold. Must be rehydrated with a gallon of water.

### 9-47: Ancient Heqeti Brood Pools

A low (3’-tall) pool runs down the center of this pebbled, greasy-surfaced chamber. It is fed by a gently-burbling fountain shaped like a trio of giant tusks (5’ tall). The side niches once held pools as well, but only a salty precipitate remains in them. The liquid in the central pool is clear, but briny. Its continued operation is a mystery of Kauket, and a source of wonder to the modern heqeti who occasionally visit it.

In the distant past, this chamber was used for mating and the raising of heqeti efts. 

### 9-48: Heqeti Chamber 

This heqeti chamber, with its pebbled, greasy surfaces, was stripped of all interesting items over a millennium ago. It is now the hiding place of Vingelok, a niravairi and a havildar in the Order of Planar Explorers (see new monsters). Vingelok is dressed in puffy, quilted orange ‘cold weather’ outfit, and carries a fair amount of exotic gear.

Vingelok is on the run, having been chased through the gate at 9-51 by the demonic huntsmen now encamped at 9-50. His comrades, Bahula and Harjot, were slain (see 9-42 and 9-50), but Vingelok, despite his own injuries, managed to locate a temporary place of refuge in this chamber. Vingelok gratefully accepts medical aid from PCs, although what he would really like is for the PCs to eliminate the huntsmen. If the latter transpires, Vingelok returns 
to 9-51 and rewards rescuers with up to three items from his stash. Those who aid Vingelok win the lasting gratitude of the Order, a fact which might prove useful in Astral or other planar adventuring. If PCs refuse to aid Vingelok, he will be dead within three days after the aroksachaul (9-50) finally get around to finishing the hunt. At that point, all that remains here is a pool of dried blood.

Vingelok, niravairi (see new monsters) and havildar in the Order of Planar Explorers, as a 10th-level fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC 1; MV 120’; HD 10; HP 27 (max 70); #AT 3/2; Dmg 3-10 
(niravairi astral tulwar), or 3-6 (niravairi astral crossbow of accuracy and bolts +2). Abilities: STR 16, INT 16, WIS 11, DEX 15, CON 12, CHA 13. Continual abilities: infravision. Special attacks: surprise on 1-3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised on 1 in 6. Possessions: niravairi astral tulwar (see new magic items); niravairi astral crossbow of accuracy with six bolts +2 (see new magic items); a niravairi personal shield (see new technological items); and other gear (see treasure).

Treasure:
Two signet rings made of steel (one his, one Harjot’s), each worth 15 gp as a curiosity; 12 platinum disks threaded on a steel rod (250 gp per disk); 100 chrysoberyls (100 gp each); a diplomat’s voice; two niravairi rebreathers; a niravairi molecular analyzer; and six packets of dehydrated rations (see new technological items for all).

### 9-49: Eastern Plateau

This relatively flat bit of rock looms 20’ above the mushroom groves and 25’ above the lake. Here the ceiling of the great cavern is only 30’ above the plateau floor. An ancient stone bridge, 5’ wide and without rails, crosses the Rimpled Run (9-71) at the northwest side 
of the plateau. To the southwest, a ramp of beaten earth leads down to the berm (9-9). Since the huntsmen established their camp on the plateau, other creatures have given it a wide berth.

### 9-50: Camp of the Huntsmen

A band of eight aroksachaul, or demonic huntsmen (see new monsters), have established a temporary camp by the wall of the great cavern. The camp comprises a gaudy yurt about 20’ in diameter; it is made of black felt colored with yellow images of the trophies the band has acquired. Two huntsmen stand on guard outside at all times, while the other six relax within. Eight yeth hounds prowl about the perimeter of the camp; their extraordinary senses make it difficult for foes to sneak up on the camp. The hounds have a 75% chance to detect the smell of intruders (even invisible ones) within a 50’ radius. If they detect potential prey they immediately begin baying (those within range must save vs spells or flee in panic).

Twelve 8’-tall iron stakes have been pounded into the stone in a circle around the yurt. From six of them hang the draining corpses of the aroksachaul’s most recent catches: Bahula, a niravairi and a naik in the Order of Planar Explorers (see new monsters); two heqeti; a bestial varumani (from 9-8); an albino baboon (see new monsters); and a quickling. 

Within the yurt are seven wooden stools, a keg of fiery demonic brandy (400 gp), a weapons rack, a large chest, and a dozen desiccated trophy heads hanging from the ceiling. The huntsmen are discussing the deliquescing ‘corpses’ of a couple of chasm cephalopods.

While traveling the Astral Plane, these ruthless and relentless fiends came upon an expedition formed of niravairi members of the Order of Planar Explorers (see new monsters), ambushed the expedition, and chased the survivors through the gate at 9-51 into Arden Vul. The lone survivor of that attack is wounded and hiding in area 9-48. The aroksachaul have a pretty good idea which way he went, but are delighting in the new environment and in letting their prey stew in a mixture of fear and hope. Within 1-3 days they will have tracked down Vingelok (9-48), slain him, and added his corpse to the hooks outside their yurt. His equipment will be added to their treasure.

This band of aroksachaul have never been to the Prime Material Plane before, and are delighted by the hunting possibilities offered here. They are arrogant, cruel, and a bit careless. They will negotiate first with a party that appears strong, but will then lay plans to track and ambush that group. They know nothing about Arden Vul save for the following: they know amphibians are to the north; that there are weak, but fast, prey among the mushrooms; and that a powerful and dangerous foe lies within the ruins to the northwest (i.e., 9-104). In return for the specific location of Vingelok (9-48), they might agree to exclude the PCs from their hunt; of course, any such agreement would be abrogated if the PCs interfered with the huntsmen’s hunting of other beings.

If a party of PCs that appears weak or wounded attempts to negotiate with them, the huntsmen will laugh evilly, begin sharpening their blades, and then ‘generously’ offer their new prey a head start of two turns before they begin the hunt.

The aroksachaul remain on Level 9 for 2-6 weeks after the PCs first encounter them; after this, they depart through the gate at 9-51. 

The aroksachaul are unable to replenish their numbers. Should any of them (or their yeth hounds) be slain as wandering monsters, those losses should be subtracted from the roster here. Of course, previous encounters will also determine the huntsmen’s willingness to negotiate.

8 aroksachaul (see new monsters): S SZ L; AC CE; AC 0; MV 120’, 270’ flying (Class C); HD 7+7; HP 58, 56, 55, 51, 50, 49, 48, 47; #AT 2; Dmg 1-4/1-4 or 3-5/4-12 (whip +2/bastard sword +2), or 4-9 (short bow with arrows of striking); MR 55%. Continual abilites: infravision; extraordinary senses. Special attacks: wield two weapons without penalty; only -1 to hit invisible creatures; cause fear; create darkness 10’ radius. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; half damage from cold, electricity, fire and gas. Special: teleport without error; detect magic; read languages; dispel magic; levitate; telekinesis; gate in another aroksachaul or a type I-III demon (50%). Possessions: whip +2; bastard sword +2; short bow and 12 arrows of striking (see new magic items).

8 yeth hounds: SZ L; AL NE; AC 0; MV 150’, 270’ (Class B); HD 3+3; HP 25, 24, 23 22, 21, 20, 19, 18; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: fear. Special defenses: silver, or +1 weapons or better to hit (damage taken is 1 per magical plus, or 1 for silver weapons).

tulwar, a niravairi astral crossbow of accuracy, and a niravairi astral staff of the magi (see new magic items).

### 9-51: Gate to Astral Plane

A ledge has been carved into the northeast side of a pillar that rises from floor to ceiling. The ledge is 20’ above the level of the northern plateau, and only 10’ below the ceiling of the cavern. The ledge appears empty, but in fact is the location of a dimensional portal connecting the Prime Material and Astral Planes. The portal is almost invisible on the prime material side, appearing only as a slight silver shimmer in the air.

### 9-52: Abattoir Cave

A strong smell of rotting flesh comes from this cave. Inside are the insect-infested remains of numerous small animals and lesser monsters, slain by the aroksachaul (see 9-50) in their hunts. As these creatures weren’t impressive enough to keep as trophies, the huntsmen tossed the mangled corpses here.

### 9-53: Cave with Statue

This cave is noteworthy for two respects. The first is the fact that a statue of a human stands in the northwest corner of the cave. The second is that the statue is surrounded by a circle containing the desiccated corpses of small creatures – albino monkeys, baindara, chasm cephalopods, etc. Unlike the abattoir in 9-52, the bodies show no sign of physical harm – it is as if they simply dropped dead.Statue of Syagria Aitón: The statue is 7’ tall, weighs 525 lb, and depicts a severe Archontean woman of advancing years. She wears a wizard’s robe and a circlet, and carries a wand in her crossed arms. The pediment bears an inscription in Mithric: “Syagria the Rhetor, Disciple of Vul the Sorcerer”. The statue is in excellent condition despite being close to 2,000 years old; it is still painted and lifelike, and has no chips or breaks. It also detects as magic. 

The reason for its pristine condition is that it is enchanted in several ways. First, it carries a necromantic protection such that any being with less than 3HD that approaches within 15’ 
must immediately save vs. death or be slain. Second, the statue is enchanted with the 5th-level magic user spell, avoidance (for purposes of dispelling, the avoidance spell was cast at 19th level of experience). Should it be possible to approach the statue, careful inspection (as detecting secret doors) will reveal a small catch on its back heel. This catch opens the concealed door that leads to area 9-55.

Concealed Door: The door to 9-55 is 3’x3’ in size. It is only visible to those who are able to approach the statue and peer behind it, and only opens by locating the catch on the statue (as a secret door).

### 9-54: Skeleton Cave

Seven human skeletons are scattered across the floor of this large cave. Most are centuries old, although a pair are of more recent vintage. The one-way door from 9-56 exits into the slightly flattened southern wall of this cave.

### 9-55: Lich Hall

The entrance corridor has been prepared with multiple castings of symbol. Fear has been inscribed in four places (floor, ceiling, north wall, south wall) just inside the entrance from 9-53. Death has been inscribed on the lintel inside 9-55, such that the first person to enter the hall will activate it.

Six slender pillars create three aisles to this quiet and shadowed chamber. Within the center aisle is a 25’-long table made of glowing orange material (arcanum – see new magic items). Two stone chairs sit at the north and south ends of the table, as do eight more along the side aisles; all ten of the chairs are occupied by skeletal figures in rotting yellow robes. Another dozen skeletons surround the table and lie between the chairs. The walls were once painted a vibrant yellow color with blue arcane symbols atop the yellow, but most of the paint is coming off in strips. Although it will be hard to see initially, a name – Syagria Aitón – is incised above the chair on the south wall. Several ancient large-format codices are open on the table, albeit covered with inches of dust.

The skeletal figures all wear yellow robes of obvious quality, even though most are torn and decrepit. Each wears a gold armband on one arm, a small iron box strapped to the other, and a tarnished silver circlet around the skull. The circlets boast a moon-shaped front-piece, into each of which has been set a 3,000 gp gem. The eyes of all ten all glow with red light. Nine of the ten are skeletal wights (see new monsters), while the tenth is none other than the lich, Syagria Aitón. 

Intruders might easily conclude that Syagria Aitón occupies the seat of honor beneath her name (to the south), but they would be wrong. In fact, she sits in the first seat along the eastern wall.  When the hall is first accessed, five of the skeletal wights immediately move to confront the intruders. In addition, five of the ‘normal’ skeletons on the floor rise as skeleton archers. Syagria and the other four skeletal wights commence the casting of spells; of course in the case of the skeletal wights, this is a deception designed to keep Syagria’s identity hidden for as long as possible (since they cast no actual spells). Once Syagria has been clearly identified by foes, the other four skeletal wights join the fray. She is likely to cast time stop first, followed immediately by power word stun, power word blind, maze, and cloudkill. Should ‘time’ still be permitting, she next casts polymorph other or death spell. If things go badly for her, she teleports to 9-56 using Syagria’s circlet (see new magic items).

As this is her lair, Syagria may not be turned here. In addition, the skeletal wights are turned here as ghosts, and the skeletal archers are turned as shadows.

Syagria collected much treasure before she shut herself away from the company of humans. That treasure is located in area 9-56. To access it, one needs to don her circlet and concentrate upon ‘treasure’; doing so activates the teleport feature of the circlet and transports the wearer instantly to 9-56. She also built in an alternative, failsafe mechanism to allow access to the chamber. This mechanism works by touching the pillars of the chamber in the following sequence: northwest, southeast, southwest, northeast, east, west. Doing so transports the being who touches the west pillar to area 9-56.

Backstory: Young Syagria became an apprentice of Vul the Sorcerer in the century after Arden and Vul discovered Arden Vul and the Archonteans began colonizing it. Syagria took a close and perhaps unhealthy interest in the site and in the properties of the arcanum found within it. Her power was great, however, and despite her strange proclivities she became a close advisor to the great military archons of the period leading up to Marius’s conquests. 
After the defeat of the heqeti, Syagria disappeared. The archons publicly announced her death in the final battle at the ziggurat, while privately admitting that her long exposure to arcanum had probably driven her mad. In fact, she had long been preparing to transcend death by becoming a lich. She brought her own disciples here, where she and they could explore the planes after death. Even now she works to ascend to demi-lichdom.

### 9-56: Lich’s Retreat

This small chamber serves as the repository for Syagria’s treasure and her spell books. Three alabaster vases (50 gp each) hold coins: 31,197 ancient copper bits (see Arden Vul items), 24,521 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), 12,749 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items), and 1,783 ancient octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items). One of the vases also holds a yellow silk pouch containing a fiery yellow corundum (2,500 gp and two golden yellow topazes (600 gp each). A simple oak side table holds a potion of fire breath; a sword +2, dragon slayer; and a pair of eyes of petrification. A small oaken bookshelf holds her eleven spell books, plus a manual of puissant skill at arms and a tome of clear thought.

Syagria’s Spell Books (in eleven large volumes): All 1st level spells (inc. UA); all 2nd level spells (inc. UA); all 3rd level spells (inc. UA); all 4th-level spells (inc.

### 9-57: Tunnel up to 8-23

A tunnel leads upward to 8-23 at this point. The mouth of the tunnel is 10’ above the level of the mushroom groves. The tunnel is largely unknown to other sentients operating on Level 9 (e.g., the Priscians), due largely to the fact that the entrance is a squeeze shy of two feet in height. After 20’ of crawling, the passage grows steadily to about 7’ in height. The only group to discover it were the kaliyani, who recently used it to establish an outpost on Level 8. Two kaliyani scouts hidden by invisibility potions lurk here in order to protect the flanks of their comrades on Level 8. If this tunnel is discovered, one of the kaliyani skitters up to warn its comrades at 8-23; the other shadows the invaders, hoping to strike from behind if and when combat breaks out on Level 8.

2 invisible 5th-level kaliyani scouts (see new monsters), as 5th-level thieves: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 150’ on six legs, 60’ upright; HD 6; HP 43, 41, 38, 36; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8/3-8 (scimitars) 
or 2-7/2-7 (javelins). Special defenses: immune to poison and mind-affecting spells. Special: infravision; DEX 16. Thief skills: PP 50%, OL 47%, F/RT 40%, MS 40%, HS 31%, HN 20%, CW 
90%, RL 25%. Possessions: twin serrated scimitars; six javelins; a set of silver rings, worked glass and minor gemstones, and repurposed coins worth 200 gp. One has a vial of poison; the other has an extra potion of invisibility.


## Level 9: 58 - 64a (The Priscian Outpost)

The modern order of the Priscians has reoccupied an outpost secretly constructed during the last centuries of the Archontean period by ‘sleeper’ Sortians embedded within the imperial 
bureaucracy. Those Sortians diverted resources and workmen to build these chambers as a refuge to which they and their friends could retreat in the case of discovery. They linked this base to two other Sortian centers, the teleport nexus on Level 6 (areas 6-45 to 6-49A) and the guardpost on Level 3 (area 3-50). The Sortians who built these areas were also friends with Isadora, lover of the deceased Priscus Pulcher, and knew of her plans for retirement 
(c.f. Sub-Level 11).

Some fifty years ago a Priscian adept from Archontos named Nerub Null (see 9-64) decided to see if he could locate the traces of the Sortians, as he and the other Priscians trace the lineage of their Order to the Sortians. He was successful in locating AV-19, which led him to 3-50 and then to 6-48. After several years of experimentation and continued exploration, Nerub Null finally figured out the secret to Sortian teleportation using Sortian eyes (see new magic items); this discovery led him to 9-59. Once established here, he sent for his comrades, and a contingent of circularii (magic users) and conversi arrived about six months ago. The team has restored the arcanum forge (9-60), which had allowed the ancient Sortians to create special and powerful magical items; having mastered some of the ancient Sortian magical practices, the Priscians are now equipped with Priscian rings, Priscian gladii, 
Priscian chain mail, and so forth (see new magic items).

Under the leadership of Nerub Null, the Priscians hope to plumb the secrets of Arden Vul. The leaders also have uncovered tantalizing hints about Isadora and her relationship with Priscus Pulcher (whom the Priscians revere as a ‘lord of magic’). Nerub Null and Jaracondus the Sprightly would like to follow up those hints, while reserving any possible rewards for themselves. Those hints, of course, pertain to Isadora’s ultra-secret refuge, located at 
Sub-Level 11.

### 9-58: Concealed Balcony

This balcony looms 10’ above the floor of the plateau. A reinforced wooden door down a short corridor leads to the Priscian outpost. The ledge and door are concealed by a hallucinatory terrain spell, which make them look like a regular rock wall. The wooden door is locked (-15% chance to pick). Keys are held by Jaracondus the Sprightly (9-63), Nerub Null (9-64), Laegel the Forsworn (7-143), Cenwulf the Unseen (9-31), Jellicos (7-44), Lukor (SL4-44), Jillia One-Ear (6-49), Justinian (6-48 and elsewhere), Ellergast Half-Elven (9-62); another key lost in antiquity may be found by searching at 9-4. A classic sliding peephole allows those within to determine who is without.

### 9-59: Sortian Face

A heavy iron portcullis separates this chamber from the hallway. It may be raised by manipulating the lever at 9-59A. 

The chamber is dominated by a 10’-diameter mosaic of a knot on the floor and by a Sortian face (see new magic items) on the south wall. 

Stacked in boxes along the east and west wall is an impressive array of dungeoneering equipment, including: 3 coils of rope, 24 vials of oil, 2 bullseye lanterns, 16 torches, 6 backpacks, 15 sacks, 3 small ivory coffers (12”x18”) worth 55 gp each, 3 iron boxes (18”x24”), 6 leather scroll cases, 20 iron spikes, 2 bags of marbles, 16 pieces of chalk, and 8 weeks’ worth of iron rations. Scattered among these supplies are some less mundane items: 12 Arden Vul cakes (see Arden Vul items), a used rudishva lesser power supply (see new technological items), and a lesser salt lamp of protection (see new magic items). Pegs near the portcullis hold 7 rock-colored hooded cloaks, while a nearby ceramic bucket holds 5 stout walking staves.

The Sortian face may be activated by placing appropriate Sortian eyes into the eye sockets of a carving. Only a few combinations of eyes are unique to an individual face; the rest are 
standard (and are detailed in the new magic items appendix).

Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area 6-48

Gold-Sapphire: A permanent magic mouth speaks in Mithric from the face: And so the war comes to an end. But at what cost? Death, destruction, and recrimination. We have sworn to uphold the peace, and so we shall. But listen! Lady Isadora, the Hekate’s dearest companion, has taken Priscus’s body from the stake. Now her estate is empty, the guards confounded. Whither Isadora and Priscus’s corpse? None know. Unwillingly, therefore, I abandon the arcanum forge and our sanctum. Our late enemies still know not its nature or location, and I will do nothing to reveal that secret. Should the need arise, future Sortians will find and restore it.

Note: This chamber is also the destination for a Sortian face found at area 6-48. 

GM Notes: The magic mouth refers to the Hekate, aka Priscus Pulcher, and to his lover, Lady Isadora, both of whom were prominent Sortians (see World of Archontos appendix). The 
arcanum forge is located at 9-60. The mage who recorded this message was none other than Jace Far-Seer (see 9-60).

### 9-59a: Guard Post and Lever

A bored Priscian conversus (see new monsters) sits in this niche, watching to ensure that no unauthorized visitors arrive via teleport in 9-59 or attempt to force the door at 9-58. In the niche is a stool, a low table, and a 3’-diameter bronze gong. The conversus is casting a set of silver dice compulsively, but will sound the gong instantly if she hears anything suspicious. Attached to the wall is the lever used to raise the portcullis across the hall.

1 Priscian conversus (see new monsters), as a 3rd-level female Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 3; HP 26; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (spear) or 2-9 (long sword). Special: she has 
STR 16 and CON 16. Possessions: chain mail and shield; spear; long sword.

Treasure:
Set of six silver dice (225 sp).

### 9-60: The Arcanum Forge

This chamber is tall (25’) and quite warm. Here a pair of smiths – Big Theo, the ‘normal’ smith, and Palestrina the enchantress – produce the special equipment used by the Priscians. The chamber practically reeks of magic, as the aura of arcanum (see new magic items) permeates the chamber. There is an 80% chance that Big Theo and Palestrina are hard at work when PCs arrive; in this case, they are easily surprised (4 in 6) due to the noise of the forge. Note: Palestrina is immune to the possible effects of arcanum due to her long exposure to it.

The dominant feature is the arcanum forge, which lies to the east of the chamber. The forge area includes a pool of effervescent, orange water surrounding a huge, 20’-diameter lump of arcanum. At the edge of the pool are all the regular elements of a forge: a furnace into which has been bound a small fire elemental; three anvils; racks with hammers, tongs, etc.; and molds for short swords, rings, rings for mail, spear heads, etc. The smiths employ the enchanted waters of the pool, as well as raw arcanum itself, to creat their magical items. 

To the west, in the worked area, are a simple desk and numerous crates of supplies. The desk holds four scrolls of permanency, Palestrina’s spell book, and a strange codex formed from fifty sheets of beaten platinum bound with demon-skin: this is Jace Far-Seer’s unique work, Forging with Arcanum (see Arden Vul books). Among the supplies are the following: 50 5-lb iron ingots (5 cp each), 50 5-lb steel ingots (5 sp each), 20 5-lb silver ingots (250 sp each), 10 5-lb gold ingots (250 gp each), 5 5-lb platinum ingots (1,250 gp each), 45 lb of arcanum in various sized chunks (see new magic items), 25 bloodstones (50 gp each), plus assorted string, bits of leather, frames for ‘sewing’ mail, and so forth. Several completed products are ready to be put into use: a suit of priscian chain mail +1, 2 priscian gladii +1, and a priscian ring infused with shield (see new magic items for all).

Big Theo is a former warrior who found a second calling as a gifted smith. He is big, strong, and dumb. Palestrina is a very powerful mage, but is by temperament more of a scholar than one who seeks power or influence. If confronted by seemingly hostile and powerful foes, she might try a sending spell to Nerub Null and then will try to teleport away.

GM Note on Sortian and Priscian Magic Items: When Nerub Null rediscovered the arcanum forge, he also rediscovered Jace Fare-Seer’s manual. This manual offers general advice on how to use arcanum to power magic items, as well as specific ‘recipes’ for a few classes of item. The Priscian smith (Big Theo) and enchantress (Palestrina) have been able to master a few of the recipes. One of these is the recipe for enchanted chain mail, although their 
results have been slightly limited. Whereas ancient Sortian chain mail was permanently enchanted, the modern Priscian version (Priscian chain mail) is temporary; the armor must be regularly bathed in the waters of the forge or the enchantment is lost. The Priscian team has also figured out how to use arcanum to produce Priscian rings and Priscian gladii. 

They have been working with limited success to replicate Sortian eyes (due in part to a missing page in Jace Far-Seer’s manual). Their procedure is time-consuming (it requires a ritual lasting three months), costly (3,000 gp worth of materials), and morally suspect (a pair of fresh human eyes are required as material components). As a result, their stock of Sortian eyes is rather small, a fact which explains their rather limited use of the Sortian faces. 

They have been unsuccessful, however, in repro-ducing Sortian faces, and Sortian baculi. Although Palestrina thinks their failure may be due to a lack of experience, Big Theo believes 
(correctly) that they are missing a crucial quire of Jace’s manual.

### 9-61: Priscian Quarters

The door to this 15’-tall chamber is open, and the sound of conversation is easily audible from within. The chamber is divided in half by a heavy black curtain, with the southern half devoted to a lounge and the northern half to sleeping quarters. Only the southern half of the chamber is worked stone; the northern half is rough-hewn and natural. 

Three magic users and three conversi are playing mahjong and drinking fermented goat’s milk in the southern half of the chamber. Should the gong be sounded at 9-59A, all six are quick to prepare spells and move to repel intruders.

The southern half of the chamber features a dozen battered wooden straight-backed chairs, five plush leather armchairs, a 10’-long trestle table with benches, two kegs of water, a console with plates, cutlery and cups, and a liquor cabinet with 13 bottles of assorted alcoholic beverages (1-100 gp each). The diagonal wall features a giant (10’) painting of the face of Priscus Pulcher, with the legend “Priscus the Great, Lord of Magic.”

Behind the curtain in the northern half of the chamber are thirteen triple bunkbeds, thirteen chests, and three desks. The chests are filled with mundane clothes and personal objects.

### 9-62: Priscian Hall of Trophies

This 20’-tall chamber might once have had a ceremonial purpose, but now it is mainly used to store interesting items discovered by Priscian exploring parties. Four 4’-diameter columns support the ceiling. The walls are painted with frescoes showing a handsome, bearded man (Priscus Pulcher) engaged in scenes of magical and political significance: counselling a diademed ruler, teaching apprentices, confronting a troll-like monster, pointing a staff at a Thothian priest, producing fire from his fingertips, etc. 

Narrow staircases on the west wall lead to balconies set 10’ up the north and south walls. 

While the floor of the chamber is cluttered with interesting objects looted from elsewhere in Arden Vul (see table below), the Priscians also use the area beneath the north landing for food storage and preparation. There may be found two work tables, a set of cookware, a cauldron of boiling, a keg of water, and six open crates holding substantial amounts of the following: dried fruit, nuts, dried mushrooms, smoked meat, beans and dried vegetables, and corn meal.

Amid the clutter four magic users are engaged in wizardly practice while four conversi look on with amusement. Loud noise at 9-58 or the sound of the gong at 9-59A alerts the Priscians here; they will prepare spells and move cautiously to repel intruders. Should visitors somehow manage to surprise the Priscians at their practice, it will take 3 rounds of combat to alert the inhabitants of 9-63, 9-63A, 9-64, and 9-64A.

### 9-63: Chamber of Jaracondus the Sprightly

The door to this chamber is usually open, although it can be locked. Jaracondus the Sprightly, the second-in-command of the Priscians operating in Arden Vul, makes his abode here. The furnishings include the following: a bed, an armoire, a writing desk, an armor rack, a plush, sea-green carpet (350 gp), a solid ivory coffee table (550 gp), and a locked iron chest. The walls are painted the same peaceful sea-green color as the rug.

Jaracondus the Sprightly is an elderly wizard, but a clever and agile one. His climb through the Priscian Order (he is a member of Nonus) has been slow and steady, as his innate caution ensured that he made few enemies along the way. These qualities made him a perfect complement for the more ethereal Nerub Null: Nerub Null thinks big and sets broad strategy, while the more practical Jaracondus implements the practical logistics. In the rare cases when the Priscians choose to treat with visitors, it is with Jaracondus that visitors speak; at such moments Jaracondus prefers to strike mutually profitable bargains. Should the outpost be assaulted from without, however, Jaracondus is swift to organize the defense. He first casts invisibility on his bonded defender, Inlevris (9-63A) and then attempts to summon an earth elemental; only then does he move to assist his comrades.

Inhabitants:

Jaracondus the Sprightly, Priscian war mage (see new monsters) and member of Nonus, as an 11th-level male Archontean magic user: SZ M; AL LN; AC 0; MV 120’; HD 11; HP 34; #AT 
1; Dmg 4-7 (dagger +3). Abilities: STR 9, INT 18, WIS 13, DEX 17, CON 9, CHA 9.

Treasure:

plus a tattered treasure map leading to area 5-19. The desk 
drawer contains three vials of hydra blood (100 gp each), 
an orange jacinth (4,500 gp), and several magical scrolls: 
protection from earth elementals, protection from 
magic, and mass charm.

The armoire contains practical clothing, including several sets of 
robes and slippers. The armor rack holds a suit of Priscian 
chain mail (see new magic items). Atop the coffee table are 
two bottles of rudishva aquavit (see Arden Vul items) and six 
silver cups (50 gp total).

The chest holds 4,731 sp and 3,499 gp, a complete set of Sortian 
eyes (see new magic items), a dagger +2, longtooth, all six 
of Jacondus’s spell books, plus a pair of fully charged rudishva 
lesser power supplies (see new technological items).

##### 9-63a: Chamber of Inlevris Half-Elven

This small chamber serves as the office and dwelling of Inlevris 
Half-Elven, the bonded defender of Jaracondus and one of the two 
leaders of the Priscian conversi in Arden Vul.

Inlevris has a desk, a bed, an equipment rack, and a locked 
chest. The floor is covered with a thin, sky-blue carpet (55 gp), and 
the walls are painted with frescoes of flying dragons.

Inlevris is an aspiring artist. Near the bed he keeps an easel, 
two canvases, seven large pieces of parchment, and a set of brushes 
and paints. He would desperately like to complete an image of 
the Whispering Glen (a famous location within the elven Realm 
of Lord Gallador and Lady Ellagel – see World of Archontos 
appendix). Despite filling the parchments with sketches, and 
attempting a formal painting numerous times, Inelvris’s work is 
just not very good (45 gp for the canvas). 

As a member of the Priscian Order, Inlevris is a superb leader 
and loyal friend to the ruling magi. He firmly believes in the need 
to advance knowledge and power in secret ways. If the outpost is 
alerted, Inlevris rushes to join Jaracondus to plan their response; 
he is then likely to slip into the outpost under an invisibility 
spell to scout and then cause havoc. If encountered in peaceful 
situations, Inlevris is an erudite, learned, polite half-elf with a taste 
for discussing art, philosophy, and literature.

Inhabitants:
2. Inlevris Half-Elven, Priscian conversus (see new monsters) 
and bonded defender to Jaracondus the Sprightly, as a 7th/9th-
level male half-elf fighter/thief: SZ M; AL LN; AC 1; MV 120’; 
HD 9; HP 43; #AT 3/2; Dmg 4-10 (Priscian gladius +2) or 
4-7 (dagger +2). Abilities: STR 17, INT 14, WIS 12, DEX 18, 
CON 14, CHA 10. Thief skills: PP 90%, OL 77%, F/RT 65%, 
MS 80%, HS 71%, HN 30%, CW 98%, RL 45%. Possessions: 
leather armor +3; Priscian gladius +2; dagger +2; dust of 
appearance; ring of free action; 2 potions of invisibility. 

Treasure: 
When Inlevris is present in his chamber, the equipment rack holds 
his leather armor and weapons. The desk holds a roster of all the 
conversi present in Arden Vul, as well as a petition to Liesbet (9-
64A) asking her to bring additional personnel to Arden Vul. In the 
drawer of the desk are some scrunched-up pieces of parchment 
with attempts at poetry, and a surprisingly good pencil sketch of 
Jaracondus (25 gp). His chest holds clothing, a piece of ironwood 
from the elven realm (see World of Archontos appendix) that has 
been shaped and sanded to resemble a moonflower (55 gp), an iron 
flask filled with two uses of oil of sharpness (+5), a silver necklace 
studded with three deep blue spinels (2,250 gp), and a scroll of 
poetry, Inellador’s Imagining in Rounds (see Arden Vul books). 

### 9-64: Chamber of Nerub Null

The door to this chamber is almost always locked. Within dwells 
the powerful but cryptic leader of the Priscians in Arden Vul, the 
archmage, Nerub Null. 

 Nerub Null’s furnishings include the following: a bed, an 
armoire, a writing desk, two comfortable leather chairs, an em-
broidered silk carpet featuring an Archontean man standing next 
to a gold dragon (450 gp), a teak coffee table (250 gp), and a locked 
iron chest. The walls are painted white, but Nerub Null has entirely 
covered them with mystical symbols, including long sequences of 
numbers and a seven bizarre words (the names of devils – GM’s 
choice as to which). 

A 10’-diameter magic circle occupies the northwest corner of 
the chamber. There is a 25% chance that Nerub Null has summoned 
a devil and is conversing with it.

The desk drawer contains three vials of devil’s ichor (100 gp 
each), a clear red ruby (5,000 gp), and several magical scrolls: 
protection from evil 10’ radius (x2), ensnarement, and 
banishment. Atop the desk are parchment sketches of six var-
ieties of devil, a rudishva head preserved in a jar, a 2-lb lump of 
arcanum, a full set of the ultra-rare Priscian texts (the Canticle of 
Arcane Knowledge, the Gesta Isadorae, the Hidden Codex, and the 
Fragment [see Arden Vul books for all]), and a torn and stained 
parchment writ addressed to Gordion, archon of Arden Vul. The 
writ reads: “To Gordion, archon, from his devoted proedros, Hasibel. 
You will be interested to know that I assigned a full kentarch to watch 
the villa of that Sortian sympathizer, Lady Isadora. My men swear 
that she never departed from the villa, and our combat mages confirm 
that nothing invisible snuck past them. And yet, when three weeks of 
observations produced no sign of the accursed agitator, my men broke 
down the door to her villa to find it completely empty! No servants, 
no guards, and – what is worse! – no Lady Isadora. We naturally 
searched the villa from top to bottom but were able to find neither 
hide nor hair of her. It was as if she disappeared by teleportation – 
but, as you know, the Archon’s wards were supposed to render that 
impossible. It is my great displeasure, therefore, to announce our 
failure. Lady Isadora, consort of the arch-traitor Priscus Pulcher, 
has utterly disappeared. I would offer my resignation if I felt that her 
disappearance had occurred through my negligence, but this is not the 
case. I smell sorcery of the worst and most dire kind. No doubt our 
other agents will pick up her trail. At that point, may I recommend 
that she be introduced to the impalement stake? She deserves to suffer 
the same fate as her treacherous lover.” The date is AEP 1713. 

GM Note: The writ is a hint that Isadora, the faithful partner of 
Priscus Pulcher, eluded the imperial authorities and thus that 
it might still be possible to locate her or her refuge. It is the 
primary reason why Nerub Null pushed the Priscians to attempt 
an expedition to Arden Vul, for he (rightly) believes that secret 
Sortian knowledge and treasure is still to be located here. The 
resting place of Isadora is SL11-19, although access to her tomb is 
also possible through her ruined estate (AV-20).

The armoire contains practical clothing, including several sets of 
robes and slippers. Atop the coffee table are two bottles of strong 
Archontean brandy (and six silver cups (50 gp total).

The chest holds 2,171 sp and 13,275 gp, a full set of Sortian 
eyes (see new magic items), Nerub Null’s eight spell books, and 
several codices: The Nine Hells: a Catalogue with descriptions and 
summoning notes; The Founder and His Deeds; Great Villains of 
Archontos, part V: Priscus the Traitor; Pandects of Thaumaturgical 
Visitation; Planar Dwellers and their Powers; Summoning from the 
Beyond; A True History of Isadora, companion of Priscus Pulcher, 
(see Arden Vul books for all).

##### 9-64A: Chamber of Liesbet the Reptile

Liesbet, the bonded defender of Nerub Null, resides in this chamber. Liesbet’s nickname is a product of her interests in snakes, her slippery personality, and her uncanny ability to slither out of tights spots. No one actually uses it to her face. Liesbet is rather pathetically loyal to Nerub Null; in fact, she cares little about anyone else. Although the putative leader of the conversi in Arden Vul, she rarely leaves the side of Nerub Null, leaving day-to-day administration to Inlevris Half-Elven.

Liesbet’s chamber has a hammock, an equipment rack, an armoire, a locked chest, and several glass display cases. The floor is covered with a wall-to-wall, thick, wool carpet in an unpleasant shade of green (20 gp), and the walls are unpainted.

The display cases occupy the east and west walls, and are 5’x2’x3’. One contains 9 mice. The other contains a pair of poisonous vipers. The armoire is nearly empty, save for six sets of boots and a couple of tunics. The desk contains a copy of the conversi roster for Arden Vul, as well as some unopened notes from Inlevris. The notes describe the Priscian expeditions to Levels 9 (9-31) and 7 (7-39, 7-44, and 7-143), as well as to Sub-Level 4 (SL4-44). They contain rosters as well as general goals for these expeditions. It is clear that Liesbet has not read the notes. 

The chest contains a variety of snake related objects: a gold statuette of a coiled cobra (175 gp); a flexible snake toy made of articulated pieces of ebony set with tiny gems (225 gp); a silver torc with matching arm rings, all in the shape of a snake (135 gp); a battered copper hooded lantern shaped like a snake’s head (25 gp); and an ebony and ivory chess set in which all of the pawns are coiled cobras (350 gp).

Liesbet is obsessed with two things: Nerub Null, whom she considers a great visionary and mystic, and snakes. The reptile fascination is largely a product of her long possession of the ring of the snake (see new magic items). This potent ring allows her to transform into a snake 3x per day, but also has turned her mind a bit towards things reptilian. She uses it less underground than she does in her normal urban life, but will quickly adopt snake form (after drinking a potion of invisibility) if things go pear-shaped for the Priscians. 

Inhabitant:

Liesbet the Reptile, Priscian conversus (see new monsters) and bonded defender to Nerub Null, as an 11th-level female Archontean thief: SZ M; AL LE; AC 1; MV 120’; HD 11; HP 49; #AT 1; Dmg 3-9 (Priscian gladius +2) or 3-6 (dagger +2). Abilities: STR 12, INT 16, WIS 15, DEX 18, CON 10, CHA 12. Thief skills: PP 100%, OL 82%, F/RT 75%, MS 91%, HS 80%, HN 35%, CW 99.1%, RL 55%. Possessions: leather armor +3; Priscian gladius +2 (see new magic items); dagger +2; dust of appearance; ring of the snake (see new magic items); 2 potions of invisibility.

## Level 9: 65 - 75

### 9-65: Roiling Lake

A lake has formed here where the two internal waterfalls of Arden Vul finally strike solid rock. The lake is 50’ deep in its center, but becomes shallow at the north and south ends. A river known to the Archonteans as the Rimpled Run departs the lake to the east (9-71). Due to the noise and power of the falls, the lake is home to no large monsters. It is well stocked with cave fish, however. Until recently, that meant that other creatures – like the mihstu in 9-68 and 9-69, and the ogre magi in 9-70 – frequently hunted over the lake. With the arrival of the aroksachaul (9-50), however, the other natural predators have gone into hiding as they await the departure of the huntsmen. 

Unsurprisingly, given its location at the foot of a huge chasm, the lake is home to several bits of forgotten treasure. It takes 4-9 turns searching underwater to turn up one of these items.

The depth of the lake remains constant, except if the dam at SL6-25 is destroyed. In this case, a massive amount of water will flow down the spillway and cause the waterfall from 6-6A to become a raging torrent for several hours. This influx of water will raise the water level by 15’ for a period of 7-10 hours. During this time period, the midden (9-87), the muck fields (9-7), the berm (9-9), and a swathe of the mushroom fields (in the south, from the lake to area 9-6; in the north from the lake to 9-76) will be swept clear of anything that is not stone. After the lake resumes its normal level, these areas will be covered with a layer of muck.

Treasure:
A bronze statue of Odin, badly corroded but still worth 3,500 gp; a beautifully carved portrait bust of the 23rd claustral prior of the cult of Set, Mauricius (345 gp); an ancient gladius +2, goblin-slayer; a rotting wooden box with six lumps of arcanum (see new magic items); a solid gold prosthetic arm inscribed ‘Histanius’ (1,200 gp); a bronze tablet serving as a ceremonial and permanent iteration of an imperial rescript granting ‘the survivor Ravatorus’ full imperial protection in return for his alchemical and sorcerous assistance, worth 475 gp (Ravatorus is the Archontean name for Reiv-Tor; see SL7-23).

### 9-66: Base of Waterfall (from 6-6a)

The waterfall produced by the spillway (6-143) lands here in a thunderous downpour. An area 50’ around the base of the falls is cloaked in spume and mist. 

### 9-67: Base of Waterfall (from 5-2a)

The second waterfall of the Great Chasm finds its base here. An area 50’ in diameter around it is clouded with mist and spray.

### 9-68: Mist-obscured Cave 

The entrance to this cave sits 30’ above the surface of the lake (9-65). It is also obscured by the mist and spray produced by the waterfalls. Once discovered, it appears to be a relatively benign place, save for being extremely damp and slightly cold. In fact it is highly dangerous, for it leads to the lair of a trio of mihstu that have made their home in this cave network; there is a 25% chance that one of the three mihstu is present here, blending into the mist. Due to the conditions, a mihstu present here has an enhanced chance to surprise (1 better pip on the dice).

The tunnels that lead to 9-69 are relatively small (6’ in diameter) and damp with moisture; movement is halved. Noise or light in the tunnels is sure to alert the mihstu, who will be sure to use the opportunity of the terrain to ambush intruders from behind. Only cautious and quiet parties have a chance to arrive at 9-69 without alerting the mihstu. Halfway through the tunnel network are the corpses of an ogre (actually an ogre mage) and a Priscian conversus (see new monsters), both recently slain by the mihstu.

1 mihstu (25% in cave; greater chance in tunnels): see stats at 9-69.

Treasure:
The conversus’s Priscian chain mail is no longer enchanted, nor is his Priscian gladius (see new magic items for both). He does have a potion of growth and a purse with 45 sp and 23 gp.

### 9-69: Lair of the Mihstu

This large, damp cave is the lair of three mihstu. Because the tunnels that feed it are slightly higher than the floor of the cave, the moisture in this entire area has condensed into a shallow (5”-deep) pool of water that covers the floor. 

To the south is a relatively dry ledge 10’ above the pool, on which is the badly rotted and encrusted corpse of a pair of ancient heroes. The pair fought an unauthorized duel in antiquity over a shared love interest. The duel led them all over Level 9 until they mortally wounded each other in this chamber. The seconds elected to lay them to rest together in secret. One is Brehmn the Scout, and the other is Sixtus Cornelius the praetor (c.f. 6-130). 

3 mihstu (unless previously encountered): SZ M; AL NE; AC -2; MV 60’, 60’ flying (Class B); HD 8+2; HP 61, 57, 51; #AT 4; Dmg 2-7/2-7/2-7/2-7; MR 10%. Special attacks: drain CON. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to electricity and all missiles (including magic missiles); stunned for 2-12 rounds by cold atacks.

Treasure
On the body of Brehmn the Scout: a buckler +2, a battle axe, and a pair of javelins of lightning.

On the body of Sixtus Cornelius: a medium shield -1, missile attractor, a long sword +1, flame tongue, and a potion of healing.

In addition to the bodies, a rotted purse contains 53 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), 33 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items), and two ancient octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items).

### 9-70: Tower of Walid

A large rock formation rises from the lake bed in this location. The formation is 100’ tall, with 50’ extending below the surface of the lake and the rest towering over it. At a point 25’ above the surface of the lake a secret door leads to a hidden ‘tower’ constructed here by a long-forgotten Archontean sorcerer.

Secret Door (north side): The door is normal to notice, and opens to a key. At the moment the only key is held by Walid the ogre mage (9-70). The lock could be picked or the door broken down.

The Tower
The tower consists of three identical levels, each 30’x20’ and 15’ tall; the three are connected by a stone spiral staircase. The entrance level is the middle level. Currently the tower is home to a band of ogre magi led by the clever and fearsome Walid. The band is, however, afraid of the aroksachaul (9-50); Walid has ordered them to limit their movement outside the tower until they depart.

Five ogre magi constitute Walid’s band; they are served by seven goblin slaves. Assuming they have not been defeated elsewhere, the initial locations of the band are as follows:

Entrance level: two ogre magi and three goblins

Upper Level: two ogre magi and three goblins

Lower level: Walid and one goblin
Because the goblin slaves are terrified that they will be eaten, they will initially fight for their masters. Should the tide appear to be turning, however, they will betray the ogre magi and throw them-selves on the mercy of any intruders.

Entrance Level: Living Space
The chamber is lit by a pair of continual light spells and is finely decorated in antique Archontean style. There are four leather chairs, a settee, two low tables, a pair of tripods of heating (see new magic items), a cloak rack, a wine rack with a dozen bottles of liquor (2-20 gp each), and a fine carpet depicting a flying dragon (350 gp). Four leather-bound codices are scattered about the room: a copy of the Pandects of Thaumaturgical Visitation; Planar Dwellers and their Powers; Travels in the Astral Plane; and Great Villains of Archontos, part V: Priscus the Traitor (see Arden Vul books for all).

Two ogre magi and three goblin slaves are present here. The ogre magi appear as humans in casual dress and attempt to engage any intruders in conversation and negotiation, posing as scholars trapped here by the arrival of the demonic huntsmen (9-50). Their conversation is meant to buy time to draw their compatriots from the other levels of the tower.

Upper Level: Study and Bedroom
Here is found a collapsed wooden bedframe, another pair of leather chairs, a tripod of heating (see new magic items), a beautiful teak desk (250 gp), another carpet (125 gp ), a bookshelf, and an armoire. The floor is covered with bone fragments and bits of gristle, as this is where the ogre magi sometimes consume their victims. Two ogre magi are busily devouring a bestial varumani, while three goblin slaves look on in terror. If combat breaks out in the entrance level, all inhabitants rush to join the fray.

The armoire holds seventeen silken robes of various colors and styles, from formal robes to evening gowns (10-100 gp each). The desk is empty save for a scroll of protection against 
possession. Atop the desk, however, are two, 18”-tall solid gold bookends carved as dragons (2,000 gp the pair) and a set of keys (both gold and platinum) to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D). On the bookshelves are the following: Thoth in All His Forms; the Trifold Tome of Theodore the Wise; the Eighth Collegium – Fact or Fiction?; On Friends and Enemies; Great Villains of Archontos, part II: Kegfiller the Proedros; Lexicon of Mithric; The Lives of the Noble Founders; On the Errors of the Sortians; and Plotina’s Recipe Book (see Arden Vul books for all).

Lower Level: Laboratory and Charnel House
The base of the tower contains a wizard’s laboratory, with two work tables, alchemical equipment, and supplies. It is also where the ogre magi torment their victims before carving them up. The floor is stained with blood, and a pile of cleaned bones lies in one corner. The glassware, retorts, mortars, and so forth are of fine quality, and worth 2,500 gp. A crate stuck under the workbench holds a small fortune in platinum: a 2-lb bag of platinum shavings worth 500 gp, and 2 20-lb bars each worth 5,000 gp. Also in the box is a codex entitled Platinum Portals: an Improvement on the Standard Silver Models; the author is one Cornelius of Arden Vul, the former resident of the tower (whose bones are in the pile). Amid the alchemical supplies are 5 potions: potions of plant control, treasure finding, oil of impact, oil of etherealness, and a philter of love.

Currently Walid and one goblin slave are here, carving up a dead human adventurer whom he charmed and slew elsewhere in the Halls. The adventurer’s gear includes a suit of chain mail, a ring of clumsiness, 77 gp, and five pink pearls (100 gp).

Inhabitants:

Walid, chief of the ogre magi: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’, 150’ flying (Class B); HD 7+2; HP 55; #AT 1; Dmg 3-14. Special attacks: charm person 1/day; sleep 1/day; ray of cold 1/day. Special defenses: fly (12 turns); become invisible; darkness 10’ radius; polymorph to human form; regenerate 1 HP/rd; assume gaseous form. Walid attacks and saves as a 9 HD monster. He wears a periapt of proof against poison and a ring of higher purpose (see new magic items), and wields a wand of illusion and a crossbow of accuracy +3 (with 12 bolts +2). He is 
unaware of the purpose of the ring, but knows it is magical.

4 normal ogre magi: SZ L; AL CE; AC 4; MV 90’, 150’ flying (Class B); HD 5+2; HP 38, 37, 36, 34; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12 or by weapon. Special attacks: charm person 1/day; sleep 1/day; ray 
of cold 1/day. Special defenses: fly (12 turns); become invisible; darkness 10’ radius; polymorph to human form; regenerate 1 HP/rd; assume gaseous form.

Seven goblin slaves: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 7, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

### 9-71: The Rimpled Run

This river flows from the lake (9-65) towards the north and east. The current is noticeable if not particularly strong, as the river bed has a gradual declination. 

### 9-72: Northeastern Plateau

This narrow plateau is the companion to area 9-49, albeit on the north side of the Rimpled Run (9-71). It is a bit less tall than 9-49, standing only 15’ above the level of the lake and 10’ above area 9-73. A set of stone stairs cut into an outcropping leads down to 9-73.

The stumps of six basalt columns that once reached to the cavern ceiling stand alongside the river. Atop one of them is the flayed corpse of a quickling; atop another is the charred and flayed corpse of a lesser varumani.

### 9-73: Northeastern Mushroom Grove

The small area between the heqeti causeway (9-75) and the Rimpled Run (9-71) is filled with more colossal mushrooms. The grove here is dark, as it is composed primarily of blue trumpets and cloud caps (see new flora). Four shriekers also wander slowly through the area. Triggering the shriekers’s noise causes the heqeti in areas 9-78 to 9-81 to be on high alert for 3-8 turns, and provokes an immediate roll on the appropriate random encounters chart.

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, a portion of the groves in a zone extending from 9-65 to 9-6 will be swept clear of anything that is not stone (including mushrooms and shriekers). After 7-10 hours, this area will drain, leaving a layer of sticky muck.

4 shriekers: SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 10’; HD 3; HP 19, 17, 16, 13; #AT 0; Dmg nil. Special attacks: noise.

### 9-74: Stone Faces

The ancient heqeti carved two monstrous, 15’ faces onto the flattened walls of this corner of the cavern. 

One face is a depiction of Kauket (see new monsters): an ovoid face, with saucer-like empty eyes, and a quarter-moon-like, toothless maw. The stone of the face is old, pitted, and slowly exudes a light yellowish, oily substance; it is the same material as the tears of Kauket, but appears in too small a quantity to coalesce into an actual tear. If tasted, however, the liquid acts as a tear of Kauket (see new magic items). 

The other face depicts Rimmaq-Isfet (see new monsters): a circular face, three lidless eyes, and an enormous maw that occupies 2/3 of the face. The maw is fanged with impossibly narrow, sharp teeth, and is surrounded by a forest of feelers/tentacles. Like Kauket’s, this face also oozes imperceptibly; the ooze is viscous but clear, and acts like the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items) if tasted.

Surrounding the two giant faces are 337 smaller faces, only 2’ high. These are far cruder than the two major ones, and represent all of the heqeti builders (see new monsters) that have governed the heqeti in Arden Vul over the millennia. The smaller faces are all slightly different.

### 9-75: Heqeti Causeway

This ancient, pitted stone causeway offers the primary entrance to the heqeti dwellings and ziggurat on Level 10. It stands 10’ above the level of the mushroom groves and is pebbled and greasy like all heqeti construction. Short, steep staircases lead down from the causeway to the groves on either side, while a third leads downward into the waters of the lake (9-65). 

Six pairs of carved granite pillars once stood along the causeway. Those pillars were all broken in antiquity, leaving stumps between 6”-18” high. The modern heqeti have driven 5’-
tall, black iron rods into each of the stumps. The ends of these rods are curved into sharpened hooks, from each of which depends a moldering and flayed corpse. The naked corpses include three (scorched) bestial varumani, five humans, a dwarf, two goblins, and a halfling. These horrific remains attract numerous insects.

## Level 9: 76 - 90

### 9-76: Heqeti Ritual Platform

The causeway widens here into a platform with three semi-circular projections. It lies 10’ above the floor of the mushroom groves, and is composed of pitted, pebbled, greasy stonework of great antiquity. A 3’-tall oblong basin occupies each of the semi-circular 
projections into the cavern. Each basin is filled with a different liquid: the northern one with blood, the western one with water, and the southern one with dried viscera and guts from mammalian creatures. In the center of the platform is a heptagonal platform on which sits the broken stump of a once-grand statue (formerly it was Kauket).

There is a 15% chance that the heqeti are holding an exsanguination ritual here. If so, four hoppers, four chosen, a builder and a weaver are present, along with a tongue-less victim and their special exsanguination device (see 9-79). The ritual party is armed (of course), but also possesses some stone cups, bowls, and spoons. The ritual takes about 30 minutes. It commences with chanting near the stump of the statue, before moving to the northern basin where the victim is exsanguinated. The heqeti proceed to the southern basin, where the builders flay the victim, and ends with the builders washing themselves at the western basin while the chosen hang the flayed corpse on one of the hooks at 9-75. The victim will be a helpless goblin. 

Inhabitants: (15%)

4 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters): see stats at 9-78 and 9-81

4 heqeti chosen (see new monsters): see stats at 9-78 and 9-81

1 heqeti builder (see new monsters): see stats at 9-78 and 9-81

1 heqeti weaver (see new monsters): see stats at 9-78 and 9-81

A mute goblin victim: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 4; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

### 9-77: Abandoned Heqeti Chamber

Due to the cave-in to the east, this ancient heqeti chamber is unoccupied. The doorway leading to the collapsed eastern corridor is trapped.

Trapped Stone Door (glyphs of warding): Two glyphs of warding have been cast here by heqeti weavers. One is a glyph of lightning (doing 20 hp damage to those who do not save) and the other is a glyph of energy drain. The glyphs are placed so that opening the door triggers both. The noise of the glyph of lightning is likely (75% chance) to alert the heqeti at 9-78.

### 9-78: Bone Portcullis and Heqeti Guardpost 

An imposing bone portcullis blocks access to and from this chamber. The portcullis is made of thick, femur-sized bones lashed together with sinew. The lower portion of the portcullis slides into holes in the floor. A simple winch within area 9-78 allows it to be raised and lowered. If a ritual has been taking place in 9-76, the portcullis will be raised.

The chamber is heqeti-made, with glistening, freshly-oiled, pebbled surfaces. The floor is painted with a black paint on which are numerous white teardrops. The winch used to raise the portcullis lies to the left of the portcullis. 

A strong party of heqeti guard this chamber, as it is the main route to their dwellings on Level 10. The guardpost area includes a weaver, a builder, six chosen, and six hoppers (see new monsters for all). Initially the builder and the three of the chosen are present here; the others are relaxing in area 9-81, but join their comrades in two rounds if needed. If combat is going badly, one of the chosen mounts the riding salamander in 9-80 (see new monsters) 
and departs to alert the Great Tongue (see Level 10 introduction and 10-47) of the arrival of powerful intruders. In the case of the direst necessity, the weaver will break his pledge of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items), thereby summoning a keqemander (see new monsters) to his aid. 

1 heqeti builder (see new monsters), 6th/6th-level fighter/cleric of Rimmaq-Isfet: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 90’, 120’ swimming; HD 6; HP 46; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (short sword +2 of wounding). Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: heqeti mail armor (-2 to AC); short sword +2 of wounding, amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items). Spells: bless, command, cure light wounds, light, fear; chant, hold person (x2), silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic, curse.

3 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 42, 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. The javelins of these chosen are smeared with Kauket’s vision (see Arden Vul items).

3 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 44, 40, 39; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. 

1 keqemander demon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC -2; MV 90’, 150’ flying (Class D); HD 12; HP 78; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/3-18; MR 40%. Constant abilities: dread (-1 to saves); 
infravision. Special attacks: acid spit (3-10 dmg; 30’ range, every other round); cause fear; darkness (10’ radius); exude acid with chance to degrade armor; use a symbol of discord. 
Special defenses: only hit by magic weapons; half damage from cold, electricity, fire, and gas; become invisible. Special: levitate; telekinesis (4,000 gp weight); project image; teleport without error; 50% chance to gate in either another keqemander or a Type I-IV demon.

Treasure:
The builder wears a copper torc chased with platinum (550 gp) and assorted rings, arm bands and amulets worth another 450 gp. The chosen each wear baubles valued at 225 gp.

### 9-79: Heqeti Chamber

This darkened chamber has all the usual features of heqeti construction. A heqeti riding salamander is tied to an iron ring set in the floor. In case of serious assault, one of the chosen from 9-78 will mount the riding salamander and flee down area 9-82 to warn the Great Tongue (see Level 10 introduction and 10-47).

1 riding salamander (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’, 90’ swimming; HD 6; HP 35; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12.

### 9-80: The Exsanguinator

This side chamber holds a sinister, 4’-tall and 7’-long contraption made of wood, bone, and leather. It is roughly man sized, with strong, iron-reinforced extensions for arms, legs and head and a pair of jointed, wood-mounted, razor-sharp bone daggers attached near the head. This is the heqeti exsanguinator, used for rituals in 9-76. It can be pushed there by 2 chosen, or 3 if it contains a victim. It works by strapping the victim onto the contraption, 
then adjusting the jointed ‘arms’ with the bone daggers until the sharpened bone begins to slice the jugular vein of the victim. The heqeti are masters of doing this slowly, such that the blood flows below into the copper vessels they use to collect it. The exsanguinator detects strongly of evil, and any paladin would feel it her duty to destroy the device.

### 9-81: Heqeti Barracks

This chamber serves as a living quarters for the heqeti assigned to guard the gate at 9-78. To the south end of the room is a 10’-deep pool running across the width of the chamber. The east and west walls are lined with eight stone sleeping benches (4’x4’x6’). To the north are a pair of decapitated and charred varumani hanging from hooks on the wall; the heqeti use them for target practice. The walls and ceiling are painted an unsettling mauve color; the floor is black, with numerous white teardrops.

1 heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 7th/7th-level magic user/cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 7; HP 34; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10 (footman’s mace +2). 
Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items); staff of healing (4 charges); copper-headed footman’s mace +2; two glass spheres of arcane assistance (one 
of arcane warding, one of protection) (see new magic items); potion of gaseous form. Magic user spells: enlarge, jump, magic missile, shield; continual light, levitate, ray of enfeeblement; fireball, protection from normal missiles; polymorph other. Cleric spells: bless, command (x2), create water, cure light wounds; chant, hold person (x2), resist fire, silence 15’ radius; animate dead, blindness; sticks to snakes. Spell book: dancing lights, detect magic, enlarge, 
jump, magic missile, protection from good, read magic, shield, sleep; darkness 15’ radius, invisibility, knock, mirror image, ray of enfeeblement, strength; blink, dispel magic, gust of wind, lightning bolt, slow.

3 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 42, 40, 37; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice. The javelins of these chosen are smeared with Kauket’s vision (see Arden Vul items).

3 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 5th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 5; HP 38, 34, 33; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

Treasure:
The weaver wears assorted jewelry and amulets worth 750 gp, while the chosen wear gewgaws worth 225 gp each.

### 9-82: Broad Corridor to Level 10-1

This 20’-wide corridor slopes downward about 300’ to the heqeti complex on Level 10 (10-1). Every 20’ a green-luminescent fungal pod has been affixed to the oily walls. Every 60’ the corridor descends down a flight of stairs built for non-human feet.

### 9-83: Northern Mushroom Groves

North of the Rimpled Run lies another large grove of colossal mushrooms. Like its southern counterpart, the grove here includes specimens from all the varieties listed in the new flora appendix. These mushrooms grow on a deep (20’) bed of humus. The entire area is lit with a low orange phosphorescence and echoes with the sounds of crickets, insects, and small animal life (e.g., baindara – see new monsters). A shallow, stagnant pond (9-84) has accumulated in the center of the groves, fed by two often-dry streams from the west and north. It should be noted that most of the northern groves lie under a 50’ ceiling and not under the open portion of the chasm.

Unlike the southern groves, however, this region is untended by any sentient beings. As a result, the northern groves are home to a variety of dangerous monsters. These include a fungal render (see new monsters), several shambling mounds, numerous shriekers, three tenebrous worms, and a handful of land urchins. The fungal render prefers to lurk on the northern side of the pond, while the shambling mounds wander to the south and west of the pond. 

The humus contains the ancient skeletal remains of hundreds of heqeti, varuda, varumani, and humans, all of whom fought and died in the chasm floor millennia ago. Should Celsus Torquatius (9-104) pursue intruders into the groves, he will be able to raise 5-8 corpses as ghasts per round.

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, a portion of the groves in a zone extending from 9-65 northwards to 9-76 will be swept clear of anything that is not stone (including mushrooms). After 7-10 hours, this area will drain, leaving a layer of sticky muck.

Searching the Fungal Forest: For each turn spent searching the forest, it is possible (1 in 8 chance) for the PCs to come across something interesting. If so indicated, use the table at 9-4 to determine what is found.

Locating Specific Mushroom Species: To determine what species are nearby at any given moment, roll on the table at 9-4. If PCs are familiar with colossal mushrooms and announce that they are looking for a specific species, then it takes 2-12 turns to locate a specimen of that species.

1 fungal render (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 9 (3 for tendrils); MV 30’; HD 12; HP 87; #AT 6; Dmg special. Special attacks: if two or more tendrils hit, 1-4 HP damage per tendril 
per round; crush aattack (4-24 damage) Special defenses: tendrils take 10 HP damage; regenerate 2 HP/turn and 1 tendril/turn.

3 shambling mounds: SZ L; AL N; AC 0; HD 10; HP 75, 72, 68; #AT 2; Dmg 2-16/2-16. Special attacks: suffocation. Special defenses: immune to fire; lightning causes it to grow; cold does ½ or no damage.

6 land urchins: SZ S; AL N; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 3+3; HP 25, 22, 21, 20, 20, 19, 19; #AT 2-12; Dmg 1-2(x12). Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: gas cloud. 

8 shriekers: SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 10’; HD 3; HP 22, 20, 19, 17, 16, 15, 15, 13; #AT 0; Dmg nil. Special attacks: noise.

3 tenebrous worms (see 9-83): SZ M; AL N; AC 1; MV 150’; HD 10; HP 70, 63, 59; #AT 1; Dmg 2-20. Special attacks: acid. Special defenses: poison bristles.

### 9-84: Stagnant Pool 

A stagnant pool of smelly liquid sits in the center of the northern mushroom groves. The pool varies in depth, but is typically only 1-3’ deep. It is fed by channels from the west and north; those channels are often dry, but occasionally channel liquids hurled into the chasm from above. The pool cannot sustain life, but is nonetheless an attraction for the shambling mounds and the fungal render, which may often be found near its shores. See 9-83 for details.

Treasure:
Four gems and a bejeweled necklace are buried in the muck of the pool: two deep green spinels (100 gp each), a deep blue spinel (500 gp), a blue star sapphire (1,000 gp), and a silver and emerald necklace (2,000 gp). Searchers have a 10% chance per turn of finding one of the six valuable items. After three valuable items are found, the chance decreases to 5%. 

### 9-85: Western Plateau

This rocky plateau sits 10’ above the northern mushroom groves (9-83) and the lake (9-65). Sloping gently from the chasm wall to its eastern and southern edges, the plateau is usually slick with moisture and liquids tossed into the chasm from above. Movement here is halved. Those using light and noise are sure to alert the shambling mounds (9-83) and other chasm denizens to their presence.

### 9-86: Dangerous Path to 7-147

A dangerous path to Level 7 commences here at the edge of the mushroom grove. This path is narrow, slippery, and fraught with danger, as it is nothing more than a set of occasional ‘steps’ inter-spersed with hand-holds, foot-holds, and cracks. The bestial varumani use it to access the chasm floor without the knowledge of the troll thegn (7-30). The path rises 300’ to area 7-147. Given its primitive nature, this route is extremely dangerous. Those climbing 
or descending it must roll 3d6 under DEX every 100’ or fall off. Thieves, or others with special climbing skills, only need roll 2d6 under DEX.

### 9-87: Midden with Buried Statue

The southwestern portion of the plateau (9-85) is open to the chasm and has, over the centuries, become a giant trash heap. Bits of bone, smashed chamber pots, broken leather straps, odd pieces of iron implements, masonry chunks and the occasional fragment of carved stonework combine together in a heap that is 5’ tall on its edges and 8’ tall in its center. There is nothing of value among the trash, as the midden is regularly picked over by scavengers. It smells rather sharply of effluence.

Still, the midden conceals a 10’-tall statue of the Archontean deity, Chibalba, that is almost fully buried in the refuse. The statue appears as a hooded, cloaked figure holding a staff in one hand and a lantern in the other. It stands on a mosaic set into the plateau, one that depicts pastoral subterranean scenes, including lizards, mushrooms, sarcophagi, bats, altars, etc. The base of the statue reads: “Chibalba, lord of the Deeps, watches over these halls. Summon him if thy need is great.” 

Should someone clear the refuse away from the statue (a task that takes 3-6 hours) and stand on the mosaic, it is possible to summon an avatar of the deity by either 1) stating Chibalba’s name three times in a row, or 2) declaiming “I summon thee, Chibalba!” 
The aid imparted by the avatar will depend on the needs of those making the invocation. The GM should use his/her best judgment in determining which situation is most appropriate. 

Situation Aid offered

In combat Avatar fights for duration of one combat: AC 0, HD 8, HP 58, #AT 1, damage 1-10

Badly wounded Cure critical wounds x2

Lightly wounded Cure serious wounds x2

Uninjured Detect traps, infravision, and locate place (see new spells), all good for 10 turns

Speaking in the Mithric language, the avatar describes in a solemn, deep voice what aid it will impart. This advice takes one round to describe, after which the avatar will not communicate in any way.

Summoning the avatar is only possible once per month. Should a cleric of Chibalba invoke the deity, then all four types of aid will be proffered to the cleric and his friends (with the combat avatar serving the cleric for one whole day, or until it is destroyed, whichever comes first).

Note: This is the third such statue of Chibalba to be found in Arden Vul; the others appear at 4-69 and 8-66.

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, most of the loose trash in the midden will be swept away down the river, fully revealing the statue of Chibalba and the entrances to 9-88. After 7-10 hours, this area will drain, leaving a thin layer of sticky muck over the stone and a few bits of remaining trash.

### 9-88: Cave with Secrets

The two entrances to this 20’-tall cave have become completely obscured as the level of the midden (9-87) has risen. Several hours of laborious excavation is necessary to unblock them. Within is a fallen statue, apparently of a human warrior. 

The fallen ‘statue’ is in fact a killer mimic, who has been hibernating for decades while waiting for prey to dig through the blocked entrances.

Secret Doors (northwest, southeast, southwest): These three well-concealed secret doors are difficult to detect (1 in 8). The rudishva built them of steel fronted with natural stone in manner that is remarkably realistic. None of the three opens from the outside; indeed, attempting to use force or magic on any of the three causes the smaller secret doors to slide open and the point defense arrays to activate, targeting anyone in the cave. The doors can only be opened using the panel at 9-89.

Rudishva Point Defense Arrays (see new technological items): The northwest and southeast secret doors are located 10’ up the wall of the cavern. They are 5’ ovals that press inward 6” before sliding into slots in the wall. Behind each door is a 5’-diameter nook that contains a rudishva point defense array (see new technological items). These items are linked to the controller at 9-89, and are hardwired to fire at anyone attempting to force entry through the 
secret door to the bastion. Physical damage to the western secret door or any attempt to cast powerful magicks (knock, passwall, etc.) at the western door activates the point defense arrays. As they contain motion and heat sensors, they fire continuously until the chamber is empty. Each array strikes as a 10 HD fighter, attacking three times every two rounds, and inflicting 6-36 HP damage on a target (impedes regeneration). 

1 semi-intelligent, killer mimic: SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 30’; HD 9; HP 61; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: glue. Special defenses: perfectly mimic stone or wood.

### 9-89: Rudishva Bastion: Control Niche 

In the southern niche is a non-portable controller for the point defense arrays found in 9-88 (see new technological items) and the secret door leading to this chamber. 

The controller is comprised of a chest-height console with view-screen that is powered by a rudishva greater power supply (see new technological items). It requires an operator’s key-card (copies are found in 9-94 and 9-96) to activate. The controller has a single screen divided into two sub-screens, plus two power switches, a dial, two joysticks, and a large red button. The screens are connected wirelessly to cameras on the point defense arrays. 

While the arrays are fully automated and remain in an active state even after all these centuries, an intelligent and experienced operator can add nuance to the system by switching over to manual control. Doing so allows one to select various settings, including 
motion-sensitive firing (the current setting), sweep firing, stutter firing, arc-control, and heat-sensitive firing, plus variation between projectiles (lethal rounds, rubber bullets, gas pellets, etc.). Manual control requires dexterous use of the joysticks. Those without formal training can only master the system by succeeding at a roll of 5D6 under INT and then a roll of 5D6 under DEX. The switches turn on or off power to the arrays, while the dial controls their 
intensity, that is, damage, from 1-6 to 6-36 (currently the setting is on high). The red button opens the secret door to 9-88. Beneath the console are three greater rudishva power supplies (see new technological items), daisy-chained together to provide power to the console and the point defense arrays. Two are empty, but the third still has 33% of its capacity remaining.

Against the west wall is a 5’x15’ view screen that displays a real-time image of either 9-88 or 9-87. The view alternates every minute automatically, but a wall-mounted trackball allows one to switch images manually. The images are derived from extremely small cameras mounted on the walls of both 9-87 and 9-88; the cameras have night-vision capabilities, and can thus display heat signatures even when no light is present. Those sitting in the great 
chair (9-11) and activating the rune of communication will appear on this screen, where their message can be heard. If desired, the operator can then use the console to dismantle the point defense arrays and open the door to 9-88.

Secret Door (northeast): This door can only be opened by pressing the red button in the control niche.

### 9-90: Rudishva Bastion: Chief of Security’s Chamber

The door to this modest chamber is a rudishva iris door; it opens only to a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items).

Within are the quarters of the one-time rudishva chief of security, Pliv-Mol. They include a wall-mounted bed and desk, made of white plasteel, an orange plastic chair affixed to the floor, and a white plasteel wardrobe. Mounted on the north wall is a holographic display screen that alternates pictures of stars, star clusters, and nebulae, cycling through 750 unique images once every ten minutes. The wardrobe contains two orange jumpsuits, some 
strange footwear (desert boots, but for large feet), and a vinyl bag containing three structural mines (see new technological items). On the desk is a GnuCoder 1000 image screen and a scattering of six data crystals (see new technological items): Letters Home, the Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven: Technical Specifications of this Yort-Class Exploration Vessel, Diary of Pliv-Mol, Chief of Security, untitled (by Dipra-Jol), Crew Roster, and Allies for Ever! (see Arden Vul books for all). 

## Level 9: 91 - 105

### 9-91: Rudishva Transit Shaft

The door to this hall is a rudishva iris door; it opens only to a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items).

A 40’-square shaft, sheathed in the same white marble and silver grout, extends 1,100’ through the Halls, commencing at 5-84 and culminating here. Built by the rudishva as a swift form of transport for their officers, it detects strongly as magical. Anything tossed into the shaft will fall normally, but anything - or anyone - coated in the opalescent liquid is capable of levitation in the pit. Levitation is at the rate of 20’ of vertical distance per round. 

Removal of even 10% of the silver grout cancels the levitation effect. From this point one can use the shaft to access 5-84, 6-164, and 7-146. 

The floor of the transit shaft is littered with the bones and equipment of the few non-rudishva who located and attempted to use the shaft.

Two granite chairs occupy the area to the south of the transit shaft. Each chair holds a giant rudishva skeleton (see new monsters). Anyone who exits the transit shaft is met with a harsh 
query in rudishva from the skeletons. The skeletons mercilessly attack those who do not immediately present a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items). They also respond in force if attacked from the shaft itself.

Inhabitants:
2 semi-intelligent giant rudishva skeleton: SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68, 55; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%. Special attacks: bone 
throwing; sonic blast. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from sharp or edged weapons; half damage from fire; immune to sleep, charm, cold, poison, and paralysis.

Treasure:
A suit of ring mail +3; a light crossbow of speed; 572 ancient silver pennies and 399 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items); a staff of the necromancer with 23 charges (see new magic 
items); a ring of protection +3; a scroll of protection from petrification; a scroll with the illusionist spells shadow door, permanent illusion, shades, veil, and alter reality; and potions of fire resistance, invulnerability and dispelling (see new magic items).

### 9-92: Basin Full of Opalescent Liquid

This side chamber holds a softly gurgling basin of black granite that is 15’ diameter and 3’ deep. The basin is filled with opalescent, sparkly liquid. Anything coated in the liquid will levitate in the shaft (9-91). The coating lasts for an hour, but can, strangely enough, be brushed off easily.

### 9-93: Rudishva Bastion: Supply Closet

The walls of this chamber are set with wire shelves made of white plasteel. The shelves are mostly empty, save for some waxy, crumpled paper-like substances, each with a set of Rudishva glyphs on one side. Among the scattered wrappers is also a lone rudishva ballistic baton and three empty data crystals for use in GnuCoder-series devices (see new technological items). 

##### 9-93a: Empty Niche

When PCs first enter the bastion, an automated rudishva dust ionizer (see new technological items) is found here, partly through its six-hour cleaning routine. The routine takes it on a clockwise circuit through the open areas of the bastion, a fact which may surprise and/or alarm jumpy PCs. Of course the ionizer is completely harmless. It has kept the bastion dust-free for many centuries and could be easily removed and transported elsewhere where it will happily perform the same service.

### 9-94: Rudishva Bastion: Captain’s Quarters

The door to this private chamber is a rudishva iris door; it opens only to a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items).

Within are the quarters of Leil-Jor, captain of the Beacon. 

Furnishings include a wall-mounted bed, a wrap-around desk, and a wardrobe. All are made of white plasteel. In addition, a 5’-tall table made of orange plasteel is set into the floor just inside the doorway. Mounted on the south wall is a holographic display screen that alternates pictures of nebulae and random locations within Arden Vul, cycling through 550 unique images once every ten minutes. The wardrobe contains two light blue jumpsuits and 
some strange footwear (desert boots, but for large feet). On the desk are some rare items: a set of keys (one gold and one platinum) to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D), a GnuCoder 3000 data recorder with a data crystal inserted into it (see new technological items for both), and one of the operator cards to the console in 9-89. The data crystal carries the somewhat unappealing title Solutions to the Propulsion Problem (see Arden Vul books), but is in fact a rather important object for those interested in employing the LOAV-291 Shuttle (see SL13-37B); indeed, it describes the compounds necessary to fly the shuttle (see SL13-37). 

Treasure:
GnuCoder 3000; data crystal; operator card to 9-89; command tablet, aka tablet of the Beacon (see new technological items for all).

### 9-95: Rudishva Bastion: First Officer’s Quarters 

The rudishva iris door to this chamber is partly open, with the desiccated and charred corpse of a rudishva in a light-blue jumpsuit jammed into the aperture, feet in the hallway and head in the room beyond. The door can be opened normally with a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque. 

Within are the quarters of Utor-Val, first officer of the Beacon.

Furnishings include a wall-mounted bed, a wrap-around, wall-mounted desk, and a wardrobe. All are made of white plasteel. Mounted on the south wall is a holographic display screen that alternates pictures of nebulae and alien landscapes, cycling through 550 unique images once every ten minutes. The wardrobe contains two light blue jumpsuits and some strange footwear (desert boots, but for large feet). Although a GnuCoder 1000 image screen (see new technological items) rests on the desk, no data crystals are in evidence. In the entrance-way are two rudishva-sized manikins, each dressed in outlandish, non-rudishva attire. One has numerous belts strapped to its body, with numerous bits of jewelry, glass, and small objects depending from them. The other is dressed in furs and leather and holds a spear. Plasteel plaques identify the manikins as, respectively (and in Rudishva Glyphik), “heqeti” and “human”.

Trap (explosive): Both the wardrobe and the bed are trapped with small charges of plastic explosive connected wirelessly to a controller affixed to the underside of the desk. The explosives detonate unless they are disabled by inputting a four digit code (5555) into the controller. Opening the wardrobe or searching the bed cause detonations worth 6-36 HP damage to all within 15’ of the blast. 

GM Note: Utor-Val was one of the few rudishva who did not handle the long exile particularly well. He grew obsessed with the local ‘primitive cultures’ (e.g., the manikins), and became paranoid. When the heqeti attack came, he was caught trying to flee to his chamber; he was killed in the doorway itself.

Treasure:
The small bits and bobs of jewelry and glass on the heqeti manikin are worth a total of 237 gp. The spear is ancient, but usable. Inside the wardrobe is a rudishva laser pistol (see new technological items) and two full rudishva lesser power supplies. The corpse of Utor-Val carries a silver rudishva identity plaque and a command bracelet (see new technological items).

### 9-96: Rudishva Bastion: Assembly Ground

This chamber was designed as a meeting and assembly area for officers of the rudishva hegemony. A huge, 20’x10’ table that rises 5’ from the floor occupies the southern portion of the chamber. Although no chairs are present, two slim t-shaped ‘roosts’ made of plasteel are set into the floor at the west end of the table. Several corpses litter the chamber: two of kaliyani just inside the northern entrance, two rudishva at the south end, behind the table, and two heqeti at the entrance to 9-97. All the corpses are ancient but show signs of charring (energy weapons); the heqeti corpses are particularly badly charred. 

Trap (fire): The corridor from 9-97 to 9-96 is trapped with a sophisticated sensor that causes a fiery blast to engulf anyone not of the rudishva, varumani, kaliyani or varuda races. The fire damage does 6-48 HP damage (save vs spells for ½ damage). There is no practical way to disarm this trap without extensive programming ability; it could be done at the control niche (9-89), but it would take someone fluent in Logik (see World of Archontos appendix – Languages) and familiar with rudishva technology, and would still require a roll of 3d10 under INT to disarm the trap.

Treasure:
The rudishva corpses bear platinum, silver and sky blue rudishva identity plaques (see new technological items). On one of the corpses are two additional plastic cards: one of the two yellow ‘captain’s cards’ necessary for access to the bridge via the private teleporter (T24), and a second operator’s card to the console in 9-89. Two melted laser rifles lie next to them; they are useless. Fek-Prail is lying atop a satchel that contains two glassteel flasks, one containing 3 quarts of centrifuged arcanum essence and the other containing 3 quarts of deuterium. These substances are necessary to operate the shuttle (see SL13-37B).

GM Note: The rudishva corpses are of Pliv-Mol, the chief of security (see 9-90) and Fek-Prail, the chemical engineer. During the surprise attack a strike team of kaliyani and heqeti descended the transit shaft (9-91) and took the senior rudishva officers by surprise. The first officer was killed by his quarters (9-95), but the chief of security almost managed to make it to the teleport nodes before getting trapped behind the conference table here. He was joined by the chemical engineer, who arrived from the shuttle bay. They held off their foes for a while before being overwhelmed. The two heqeti attempted to use the teleport niches and were fried by the trap.

### 9-97: Rudishva Teleport Nodes

This chamber possesses no 90-degree angles, is spotlessly clean, and is sheathed with black granite panels in the usual octagonal pattern. All of the three niches contain 5’-diameter circles of silvery material inset into the floor. Only two, however, have the usual 10”x10” squares of the same silvery material affixed to the wall. Each square has a different rune etched into the silvery material. 

The third, northern niche (T24) is blocked by a rudishva force shield. Next to the shield is a 10”-square golden plaque inset in the wall. The force shield may be circumvented in one of two ways: 1) when either of the two special yellow identity plaques (the ‘captain’s card’ – see 5-98 and 9-96) is touched to the golden square; or 2) when disintegration is cast upon the force shield. In the latter case, the spell causes an electrical explosion that does 4-24 HP damage to all within 15’. Note: although this force shield is similar to those at 5-90A, SL6-37, and SL9-50, there is no motion-activated fiery dancer in this shield.

The rudishva built these niches to be part of their teleportation network. To activate them, one stands on a silvery circle and touches the adjacent silvery square; teleportation to the appropriate location is instantaneous. 

Trap (fire): The corridor leading to 9-96 is trapped; see that entry for more information.

Teleport Nodes:
T19: accesss to 8-52
T20: access to SL13-38 (shuttle bay)
T24: access to SL14-7

### 9-98: Archontean Pediment

This section of the level is elevated, rising 20’ above the surrounding cavern floor, and is sheathed in granite flagstones. Several sets of stairs lead down from the pediment. Two ballistae are mounted on pedestals overlooking the mushroom forest; these are still functional, although no bolts are present. Four imperial stone guardians (see new monsters) sit on the pediment; they are marked “G” on the map. The southernmost guardian, although intact, is inert and no longer functions. The other three guardians are active, and respond to motion and sound with lethal force. The guardians do not detect invisible entities, and are unable to pursue foes down the narrow tunnel to 9-100.

In the western ell, by the cavern wall, is found a set of 2”-tall paving stones arranged in a 6’-diameter ring. Inset into the floor next to the ring is a rectangle 48” long by 8” tall; the rectangle is divided into six interior compartments, each 8” square. Together these elements form a Thothian teleportation ring (see new magic items). To activate the ring, one must place six colored glass activation squares into the inset according to a sequence that matches the ‘address’ of the ring to which one wishes to travel. Once the squares are placed, a brief shimmer of energy is visible over the ring. At this point the user has 1 round to collect 
the squares and enter the ring, after which anyone in the ring is teleported without error to address indicated by that sequence of squares. If the glass activation squares are not collected and/or if the travelers do not possess a second set of them, they are likely to be stranded in the location to which they have just teleported. The address of this ring is as follows: BL-YE-GR-RE-BK-WH (see new magic items for explanation). None of the glass activation squares necessary to operate the circle are present.

3 imperial stone guardians (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 64, 57, 53; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

### 9-99: Radical Spriggans

The sound of numerous small drums beating together in rhythm emanates from this cave; the drum beats are punctuated every five minutes or so by a set of ragged screams. Within the cave are six Arden Vul spriggans (see new monsters) huddled around a 4’-tall statuette of a winged faerie. 

These spriggans have gone rogue, abandoning their comrades (8-155) and the task assigned to them by their Tiarna (lord), namely to locate the missing spriggans (see 7-62). Unhappy with their mission, these six have adopted radical views, and are trying to convince each other that they have been slaves to the faerie lords (Tiarnaí). As a result, they have made a pact to reject all the aspects of spriggan culture that they consider ‘slave’ attributes, including ‘silly games’, lewd songs, and general capering. They have firmly sworn off, for instance, The Green Silken Robe, and immediately attack anyone who attempts to sing it to or with them (although each must make a save vs spells to resist joining in on the chorus). 

Instead, they are eager to talk about their alleged oppression at the hands of the Tiarnaí and about social justice in general. To this end, they enjoy reciting Beat-style poetry with hand-drums as accompaniment. Their current favorite is a new composition called “Scream!,” to which they all listen intently before joining in with soul-tearing screams as appropriate:

Scream!
Caper. Smile. Sing. 
 Find the treasure, wait nearby.
 Tiarnaí order and we comply.
Caper. Smile. Sing. 
 Sharpened spear, Sharpened teeth.
 Tiarnaí send us off to death.
Caper. Smile. Sing. 
 Growing big, shrinking small.
 It’s always at the Tiarnaí’s call.
Caper. Smile. Sing. 
 Suck the marrow, drink the red.
 The Tiarnaí always want more dead.
Caper. Smile. Sing. 
 WAIT!
 Why not tell the Tiarnaí no?
 Why not work to bring them low?
Walk. Frown. Recite. 
Spriggans shall indeed unite,
And together we shall ... SCREAM!

Despite their radical slogans and enlightened outlook, these spriggans are currently at a bit of a loss about what to do with themselves. Cautious visitors are greeted warmly and invited to sit down and share in the radical rhetoric; those who play along and agree with the spriggans’ complaints will become ‘best comrades’, to whom the spriggans will offer alcohol and information. Those who disagree or even don’t agree warmly are likely (50%, plus an additional 10% chance per turn) to be attacked as ‘oppressors’. Singing or mentioning The Green Silken Robe, or approvingly mentioning the spriggans in 7-62 or 8-155, causes this group to attack instantly. Strangely enough, also reporting the death of the other spriggans will also cause combat. 

The spriggans can reveal the following information to their ‘best comrades’: the location of Walid the ogre mage (9-70), the location and some of the powers of Celsus Torquatius (9-104), the existence of the shambling mounds (9-83), the existence of the buried statue (9-87), and the fact that there is something ‘dodgy’ about area 9-108. They might also trade their potions for high quality alcohol or other ‘interesting’ admixtures.

Secret Door (north): The secret door is normal to locate, and opens by singing or playing any bar of music with at least five different notes. A thief may (3 in 6) notice that a musical note is scribed nearby (a hint about the door). The spriggans are unaware of the secret door.

6 Arden Vul spriggans (see new monsters): SZ S or L; AL CN; AC 4 (5); MV 90’ (150’); HD 5 (8+3); HP 38 (65), 36 (63), 34 (61), 32 (60), 31 (59), 30 (55); #AT 1 (2); Dmg 2-5 (knife) or (2-12/2-12); MR 25%. Thief skills: PP 75%, OL 78%, FRT 70%, MS 77%, HS 64%, HN 35%, CW 81%, RL 40%. Special attacks: confusion 1/day. Special defenses: immune to poison, charm, and mind-affecting spells; healed by magic missiles. Special: grow to giant size; affect normal fires, faerie fire, trip, detect magic, shatter. 

Treasure:
Each spriggan carries a pouch with 75 gp, 15 gp and a potion; one of the spriggan also has a contraband tin whistle. The six potions are as follows: potions of plant control, human control, diminution, the berserk, deafening light, and hostile levitation (for the last three, see new magic items). The 4’-tall statuette depicts a slim, winged faerie sitting on a toadstool; it is ceramic and brightly colored, but strangely heavy. Breaking off the ceramic covering reveals an ancient statuette of the dwarven all-father, Zodarrim, in his guise as the First Tapper, holding a chisel and hammer (see Gods of Magae in World of Archontos appendix). This inner statuette is quite rare and worth at least 9,500 gp. If sold as a heavy piece of painted ceramic, however, it will bring only 300 gp. 

##### 9-99a: Narrow Tunnel up to SL10a-8

This 5’-wide passage winds upward until it reaches the cavern outside the citadel of the Sun-Scarred Knights (SL10A-8). Periodic steps have been hewn out of the rock along this tunnel.

Secret Door (south): The door is easy to find (1 in 3), mostly because five faded musical notes have been painted on it in red. It opens by singing or playing a bar of music with at least five different notes.

## Level 9: 100 - 107 (The Archontean Praitorion)

This small complex was built in the aftermath of Archon Marius’s conquest of the heqeti. He ordered a command center to be built here, to watch against heqeti recrudescence. By tradition, the complex – which came to be known at the Praitorion – was the home to an elite tagma of guardsmen and the resting place of one of the great treasures of Arden Vul, the tablet of the Beacon (see 9-107). When the Archonteans retreated some 1,200 years ago, the Praitorion was abandoned. Over the intervening twelve centuries, it has suffered structurally from seismic activity, particularly around the spot where area 9-100 connected to area 9-98. And yet the tablet still rests in its reliquary, thanks mostly to the efforts of a vengeance aspect of Sekhmet (9-104), whose fearsome powers have kept the Praitorion clear of looters.

### 9-100: The Praitorion: Central Hall

Two rows of thick granite pillars flank this broad hall. The floor is littered with chunks of masonry, bits of equipment, mounds of debris, and the long-decomposed corpses of 24 un-identifiable man-sized creatures, all covered with dust. A 25th corpse, of a charred Priscian, is recent. The pillars were once painted in blue and green, but the paint has peeled off, with only a few remaining strips hanging down into the dust. 

Clear signs of a party of six to eight bipeds moving from east to west are evident in the dust, as is a slightly acrid smell, as from charred flesh and burned dust. 

Dawdling in the hall (to inspect the corpses, for instance) is likely to bring Celsus Torquatius, the vengeance aspect of Sekhmet (see new monsters), from 9-104 to assault and pursue invaders. The chance starts at 1 in 6 after a turn, and rises by one every subsequent turn (2 in 6 the 2nd turn, 3 in 6 the 3rd, and so forth). If he does arrive and attacks, he will raise undead from the numerous corpses at a rate of 4-8 ghouls every other round.

Celsus Torquatius, from 9-104 (see text for chance)

Up to 25 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 17, 16(x3), 15(x4), 14(x4), 13(x4), 12(x4), 11(x3), 10, 10; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

Treasure:
The corpse of the Priscian (Khulan the Westron, a member of Tertius) has some useful items: a charred leather purse with 31 cp and 73 gp, a wand of illumination (13 charges), a bone 
scroll case with a scroll of transmute rock to mud, and a set of Priscian chain mail (see new magic items). Buried in the dust in the southwest corner is a token of Arden (see Arden Vul items); it takes many turns of careful searching to find this item.

### 9-101: The Praitorion: Route to 7-136

This broad corridor leads upward to Level 7 (area 7-136). It is mostly untraveled, with two exceptions. One is the vampire, Cinna Minux (7-122), who regularly travels this way in gaseous form. The other is a bold band of Priscians from the outpost (areas 9-58 to 9-64), who made their way past Celsus Torquatius (9-104) and are now engaged in a desperate battle in area 7-143. Signs of this party’s passage are evident in the dust and general debris. 

### 9-102: The Praitorion: Barracks of the Elite Guards

As one of the two barracks for the guards tagma assigned to watch the chasm floor during the Archontean period, this chamber is a shambles. A heavy silk curtain once divided the chamber in half, but it lies in tatters, such that the image of crossed gladii picked out in gold thread is only barely visible. 

To the east of the divider was a large open space, with some benches, a now-broken tripod of heating (see new magic items), various wall-mounted weapons racks and a large mural of 
legionaries with crossed gladii painted on their breastplates. The area is filled with junk.

To the west of the divider are the ruins of eight wooden bunkbeds, all collapsed in heaps of wood, rotten wool, and ancient animal nests. Sorting through the junk is time consuming. There is a flat 1 in 6 chance to find something interesting after a turn; this rises by one pip per subsequent turn. If something is found, roll on the following table to determine its identity:

D6 Item GM Notes

1

6 ballista bolts for the machines found at 9-98, wrapped in a decrepit woolen cloak 

Five are normal bolts, but oneis an incendiary bolt (explodes for an additional 2-16 HP damage on a hit)

2

603 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) inside a rusted legionary’s helmet

3

A bronze plaque, 3”x6”, with an enameled image of a lion-headed goddess carrying a spear and an ankh, plus an inscription

The plaque shows Sekhmet (see 9-104), the aspect of Wadjet, in her guise as goddess of war
and avenging fire. The inscription reads (in Mithric) “Sekhmet, whose fire cleanses guilt and 
defends the fortress”. The plaque is worth 50 gp.

4

5 javelins tied up with a long rope

The rope is an elven rope (see new magic items)

5

A writing tablet made of bronze with a wax interior; a draft letter is still visible in the wax

The letter reads: “Dearest Manlia: the situation continues to deteriorate. The priests have fled 
from the administrative precincts, and yet we are required to maintain our position at the bottom of this hellhole. Our chiliarch is a good man, but altogether too rigid in his devotion to honor and duty. We all await with desperation the order to fall back. May it come swiftly. Your dearest brother, Callimachus.”

The draft letter reveals some of the rationale behind the murder of Celsus Torquatius by his men (see 9-104)

6

Three enormous black freshwater pearls, strung together on a piece of rawhide

The pearls are worth 5,000 gp each; the ‘rawhide’ is cured human skin.

### 9-103: The Praitorion: Barracks of the Elite Guards

The basic layout of this chamber is identical to that of 9-102, with an open area close to the door and bunkbeds behind a silk curtain to the west. Like area 9-102, the room has been trashed, with torn clothing, smashed crockery, broken weapons, and random bits of stoneware and equipment strewn everywhere. 

Searching is also possible, with the same chances for success as in 9-102. Roll on the below table for each successful search result:

D6 Item GM Notes

1

4 ballista bolts suitable for the machines in 9-98

2

A large plug of aromatic leaves, lightly bound together with oil and wrapped in silk

The leaves are a mild narcotic. If chewed they provide a +2 defense vs fear and mental attacks for a period of up to 6 turns, but cause a temporary loss of 1 point of WIS. The plug contains 9-12 doses

3

A polished ceremonial shield made of wood with substantial silver adornments, including a grinning troll’s head carved into the silver boss

The shield provides no bonus to AC, but does provide a +5% to reaction rolls to all but varumani, with whom it provides a -15% modifier to reaction rolls (since the varumani resent the caricature)

4

A gladius in a wooden sheath; it glows brightly upon examination

The sword is a cursed short sword -2.

5 A 

bag with 37 pieces of turquoise in it

The turquoise is worth 10 gp per piece; amid the lesser gems is afine emerald worth 1,250 gp.

6

A folded parchment rescript from Archon Pellas the Last to a certain Jovianus Rubeus

The rescript has been folded and unfolded several times. It reads: “To Jovianus Rubeus, dekarch in I Legio, from Pellas Idreonus, archon. You are hereby and immediately reassigned to the Guards Tagma stationed to the Praitorion within the mountain. Report immediately to the chiliarch of the tagma, Celsus Torquatius, for further instructions. Obey him as you would your own scutarion. May the emperor lend you strength. [dated 1803 AEP]” 

GM Note: provides the name of the vengeance aspect found in 9-104 (see new monsters). The rescript could be sold as a curiosity for 35 gp.

### 9-104: The Praitorion: Military Chapel

This former military chapel is dark, save for a jet of burning flame that extends upward from a black basalt altar set at its south end. Thick layers of dust coat the floor and lower portions of the walls. Eight shapeless lumps dot the floor, also covered with dust. Scorch marks mar once-bright frescoes depicting the mustering of imperial legions along the eastern and western walls; the legions’ archons offer sacrifices of weapons and trophies to a lion-headed goddess who holds a spear in one hand and an ankh in the other. Slumped in front of the altar is another lump, this time identifiable as a desiccated, mostly skeletonized corpse wearing enchanted imperial field plate +2 (see Arden Vul items). The corpse appears to be gripping the altar.

Close examination of the dust (by, say, a ranger) will reveal that mostly-filled footprints lead from the altar to the entrance of the chapel, and back again. 

Vengeance Aspect: Entering the chapel causes the dust to swirl, making vision hazy; even still, the flames at the altar will flare brightly. A round after the area is entered, an apparition emerges from the armored corpse by the altar. The apparition appears as a ghostly and immaterial male Archontean with military haircut and bearing and wearing (immaterial) field plate. Its eyes glow with yellow fire, and it utters the following words in a disconcerting, silkily feminine voice (in the Mithric tongue): “Betrayal requires vengeance!” [the voice is that of Sekhmet herself]. The spirit is none other than Celsus Torquatius, formerly chiliarch of the elite guards tagma in Arden Vul and now a vengeance aspect of Sekhmet (see new monsters). Celsus attacks relentlessly, pursuing intruders throughout Level 9 (but not elsewhere), and raising lesser undead as necessary to aid it in its vengeance.

The eight lumps are the remains of long decomposed Archontean soldiers; their equipment is also useless, having been charred into rubble by intense fire. Each does possess a purse 
containing 31-40 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) and 4-7 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items). If Celsus engages intruders in this chamber, he will immediately raise the eight lumps to fight beside him as ghasts.

Although it is technically possible to appease a vengeance aspect, usually by avenging the wrong which caused it to manifest in the first place, Celsus Torquatius is intractable and rather unfair, judging any intruder to be equivalent to his betrayers. Only those swift and canny enough to recognize a vengeance aspect of a god (i.e., clerics who successfully roll 3d8 under their INT) and who then immediately and loudly proclaim themselves to have made a sacrifice for the greater good can slow Celsus’s wrath. Even then he pauses for only a few rounds, allowing the speaker to outline the sacrifice made by the speaker (or on his behalf). If Celsus is impressed (with a ‘friendly’ or better result on a reaction roll), then he allows the intruders to depart, although they will have to repeat the process should they return. If unimpressed, Celsus attacks.

Altar: The altar is dedicated to Sekhmet, the aspect of Wadjet de-voted to warfare and cleansing fire. It is clear of dust and rather simple, with only a trio of erect swords etched into the front face to reveal its identity. The flame of Sekhmet burns continuously (unless the chapel should be desecrated), flaring only into greater brightness when her vengeance aspect is active. The flame is cold and harmless. Damaging the altar by physical force or magic results in firebolts of 6d6 HP each being targeted at the desecrators (although those who survive can successfully de-sacralize the altar). In addition, if the vengeance aspect of Sekhmet is slain in this chamber, the same firebolts strike all those who inflicted damage on the vengeance aspect. Should the vengeance aspect be slain elsewhere, however, the firebolts do not appear.

GM Notes: As the Archontean grip on Arden Vul began to crumble during the War of the Sortians and Theosophs, the archon became increasingly worried about the safety of the artifact known as the Tablet of the Beacon (see new technological items; currently in 9-107). Despite the general chaos, the tablet had been kept in this forward outpost on Level 9 since the days of the great Marius Tricotor. Indeed, it remained on Level 9 because Marius had 
ordered it to be so (see 9-107 for details). Celsus Torquatius was then the chiliarch (commander) of the guards tagma of Arden Vul, and a man of fidelity and honor. Ordered by Archon Pellas the Last to defend the tablet and this outpost to the death, Celsus gathered 
the legionaries of the guard in the military chapel dedicated to Sekhmet. Celsus demanded that his men take a fearsome oath to Sekhmet to never abandon their post, whatever might happen above. His legionaries were weak and frightened, however, and as Celsus presented his sword ritually to Sekhmet, eight of them cut him down from behind. Sekhmet immediately slew the eight with fire, but the others fled, joining the flight from the halls. Celsus Torquatius returned as a potent vengeance aspect of Sekhmet; since that day almost 1,200 years ago, Celsus has guarded the outpost, interpreting his/its task as requiring that all intruders be hunted down and punished.

Celsus Torquatius, a vengeance aspect (see new monsters) of Sekhmet: SZ M; AL LN; AC 0 or 7; MV 90’ flying (Class A); HD 9; HP 62; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 75% or 50%. Special 
attacks: cause fear; animate dead; stunning shout; power word, blind (2/day); create any magic user symbol (1/day). Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; ethereal; Special: detect magic, detect evil, detect invisibility (all at will). 

8 ghasts (potentially): SZ M; AL CE; AC 4; MV 150’; HD 4; HP 31, 30, 28, 27, 24, 22, 20, 18; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-8. Special attacks: stench; paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

Treasure:
Celsus Torquatius’s enchanted imperial field plate +2 (see Arden Vul items); his saffron-yellow-hilted long sword +4 (defender), named Crocensis, lies in the dust before the altar. On each of the eight corpses: 31-40 ancient silver pennies and 4-7 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items).

### 9-105: The Praitorion: Chiliarch’s Chamber

Like the rest of the Praitorion, the chamber of the commander of the Guards Tagma is a wreck. Teak furnishings – bed, armoire, table, and armchairs – have been smashed into pieces, with the contents scattered willy-nilly across the chamber. 

Among the litter are two interesting items: the tattered, yellow-silk phlamoulon of the tagma, with its crossed gladii and the word ‘fidelity’ (worth 500 gp to Archontean collectors), and a parchment rescript sent by Archon Pellas Idreonus to chiliarch Celsus Torquatius (worth 350 gp to a collector). The rescript reads: “To my sodalis Celsus, chiliarch of the Tagma, from Pellas, unworthy archon in these dark days. I regret to have to inform you that you are ordered to stay in place with the other heroes of the tagma. As was ordained by the divine Marius himself, the watch against the hoppers must be maintained, and control of the sacred tablet reserved for imperial (and not temple) use. To that end I am sending you an additional spatha with provisions lasting 6 months. You are to operate with my full authority in my absence. Once affairs in the Shining City have been resolved and order has been restored to the city of Arden, your sacrifices in protecting imperial territory will be recognized and rewarded. You are hereby granted license to forage in the great cavern as needed. I have also sent you a magos, Petreon the Younger, to aid in your endeavors. He brings with him the control words for the imperial guardians. Your task is great, but our trust is greater. Valete!” 

### 9-106: The Praitorion: Command Chamber

Access to this barrel-vaulted chamber is via a narrow tunnel wending through piles of collapsed masonry. This was the nerve-center of the Archontean praitorion, where strategy was plotted and expeditions into the wild reaches of the chasm floor planned. 

The north wall has an enormous, floor-to-ceiling fresco, in faded, archaic style, showing a central legionary commander with a red-hilted gladius, flanked by three officers on each side. All are dressed in ancient legionary style. A much later hand has annotated each of them in a careful Mithric script; the central figure is marked ‘Marius, archon’, while the other figures are marked from left to right as ‘Lucius the scriptor’ (6-135), ‘Regulus the kentarch’, ‘Ligareus the kentarch’, ‘Theodorus the scutarion’, ‘Irene the polemarch’, and ‘Galen the taxiarch.’ 

A sand table (12’x12’) with 48 lead legionaries, 48 assorted lead humanoid figures, and some pieces of scenery (stone blocks) occupies the western portion of the room. The lead figures are worth 125 gp. Under the sand table is a smaller chess table, with a lacquered box holding all 32 pieces in silk-lined compartments. The box itself is worth 225 gp, while the 32 pieces – finely carved platinum with felt bases – are worth 250 gp each. 

A pile of filthy and stinky textiles occupies a portion of the western part of the chamber. The pile moves alarmingly, but is in fact the ‘nest’ of a hairless cat and her six kittens. Only after 3 
rounds of strange muffled noises and movement is it apparent that cats, and not monsters, dwell in the pile.

Secret Door (west): This narrow (2’-wide) door is normal to find. It opens by sticking a 1”-diameter rod into a small hole set into the fresco (the eye of “Lucius the scriptor”).

Inhabitants:
A hairless cat and her six kittens.

### 9-107: The Praitorion: The Tablet of the Beacon 

Originally the private chamber of Marius Tricotor during and after his successful campaigns against the heqeti, this small chamber came to be the formal location of one of the Archonteans’ great treasures, the tablet of the Beacon (see new technological items). The west wall offers a fresco of an archon (Marius) standing before a set of stairs into the ground; around him in a triangle are three obelisks. The Mithric inscription above the scene reads “The obelisks shall open the way to the chamber. There the tablet may be employed.” [Note: the inscription refers to areas AV-5, AV-28, and AV-41, and the stairs at SL14-1 leading to the chamber of the Beacon, aka SL14-10].

Below the fresco is a stone pedestal on which sits an ebony casket, carved with images of Archonteans interacting (implausibly) with rudishva-like beings. Within, nestled in a bed of yellow silk, is the tablet of the Beacon (see new technological items). Beneath the tablet is an octavo quire of 48 folios made of parchment and without binding boards; it provides a sort of ‘user’s manual’ for the tablet and applies to the chamber of the Beacon (SL14-10). 
The opening folio reads in red ink: “The tablet is the property of the archon, and not that of the high priests of Thoth, Set or Horus. Ensure it remains safely in the hands of the civil authorities. Marius”

Against the north wall is a simple wooden camp bed, as well as two folding chairs, a travel desk, a scroll case, and a tripod of heating (see new magic items). All the wooden furniture is intact, but extremely fragile and is 75% likely to crumble with contact. 

Inside the travel desk is some ancient dried ink, two styluses, six rescript-sized sheets of parchment, 3 silver ankh-keys (see Arden Vul items), a parchment quire with the addresses to all of the Thothian teleportation rings (see new magic items) inscribed on it (a description of each chamber is placed next to each address), and a pair of gold signet rings with the letters ‘MT’ (Marius Tricotor) on each of them. The rings could be sold for 1,500 gp each to an Archontean collector. The scroll case contains a three-scroll ‘complete’ edition of The Deeds of Marius Tricotor; Irene Bellatrix: on the Wars of this Great Archon; The Honorable Life of Ligareus, Archon; and a four-scroll anonymous Archons of Arden Vul, that lists all archons from Fretevus of Haldor to Ismil the Coward, with brief annotations about the reign of each. Rolled up inside the third scroll of the Archons of Arden Vul is a spell scroll containing Kentillian’s animate water (see new spells).

Treasure:
The tablet of the Beacon (see new technological items), inside an ebony box (450 gp); also a tripod of heating (see new magic items). Two gold rings, plus four historical works and a spell scroll.

## Level 9: 108 - 120

### 9-108: Broken Statue and Hidden Passage

An octagonal pedestal rising 3’ above the floor stands in the middle of this side cave. The stump of an ancient statue rises from the pedestal; the rest of the statue lies in shapeless lumps near the pedestal. All the stonework is slightly oily and pebbled, marking heqeti construction. Close inspection reveals an arrow pointing toward the ground carved into one side of the pedestal. 

The pedestal is the key to opening the hidden passage that leads towards area 9-108A. The pedestal rests on a vertical stone axis, and can be turned slowly in a circle past four stops, one at each cardinal direction. The arrow on the side of the pedestal is currently located at the north stop. Turning it 90-degrees to the right, that is, to the east stop, causes counterweights in the southern wall to raise the secret door leading to 9-108A. The mechanism is old and finicky, and requires the application of 50 points of STR to move. Nothing happens if the pedestal is turned to the southern or western stops, as the traps associated with those positions ceased working ages ago.

Secret Door (south): The door is difficult to spot (1 in 8 chance) due to its thickness and natural rock exterior. It can only be opened by manipulating the pedestal as described above (or by manipulating the stone wheel in 9-108A). Doing so causes the door to rise into the ceiling; after a turn, or unless the pedestal is manually held at the eastern stop, the door slides back into place.

##### 9-108a: Door Mechanism

This small cave contains the second mechanism by which the secret door to 9-108 can be opened. The mechanism takes the form of a stone cap placed over a metal rod rising out of the ground. Holes (3” in diameter) are set into the cap, allowing objects to be placed into the cap like spokes from the hub of a wheel. With these ‘spokes’, the cap can be turned slowly, causing the secret door to 9-108 to rise.

Two 3’ iron bars are found on the ground near the mechanism. They clearly fit into the stone cap.

### 9-109: Silent Canyon

This foreboding canyon is 60’ tall and runs southeast for close to 250’. The floor of the canyon is white sand (10’ deep), dotted with an occasional boulder and scores of skeletal heqeti half-buried in the sand. Six ledges line the sides of the canyon, ranging in height 
from 10’ to 30’ above the canyon floor. In contrast to the constant hum of insect noise and wind effects in the main chasm (9-1), the canyon is deathly still and quiet. Indeed, the slightest sound echoes off the canyon walls. A palpable brooding evil fills the canyon (a fact which paladins and good clerics will instantly notice).

Every turn a breeze blows down the canyon, from southwest to northeast. The breeze is dry and produces numerous eddies and dust devils. The effects make vision difficult in the canyon.

The canyon was one of the original homes of the heqeti within Arden Vul. Primitive dwellings lined the canyon, and more finished public spaces occupied its southwestern tip. The rudishva slaughtered those dwelling within the canyon shortly after the crash of the Beacon, and the area was never recolonized. 

The area is currently the preserve of the undead heqeti old ones (aka the more powerful sort of heqeti hopping dead – see new monsters) who operate under the dominion of the Old Father (9-126). For every two turns spent in the canyon proper, there is a 20% chance that 3-6 of the skeletons buried in the sand clamber forth and assault the intruders. 

3-6 heqeti old ones (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6+6; HP 47, 45, 40, 39, 38, 37; #AT 1 Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned 
as spectres; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells.

### 9-110: Toppled Colossus

A huge heqeti statue lies in ruins here. Originally some 40’ tall, it depicted a slug-like being with a vaguely-heqeti head. The head (10’ in diameter) has broken off and lies at a crazy angle in the sand. The face is flat and amphibian in features, with no ears, huge saucer-shaped eyes, a slit nose, and a gaping, toothless maw. The body is thick and cylindrical, albeit worn and pitted from the canyon’s breezes; the original arms are missing, buried in the sand. The statue was a crude depiction of the heqeti demon-lord, Kauket. 

A kaliyani corpse is pinned to the statue with stone spears; this warrior was a casualty of the kaliyani expedition that departed SL9-37, entered Level 9 at 9-119, fought their way past the old ones into the chasm proper at 9-108, and then found the tunnel at 9-57 leading up to 8-23. The corpse is only a few days old; it lacks equipment, but is still adorned with belts and small bits of jewelry and tokens (worth 73 gp).

Noise and/or light at this location is very likely to attract the attention (if not already attracted) of the heqeti old ones at 9-111A/ 9-111B and 9-112A.

### 9-111: Caves
##### 9-111a: East Cave, with Old Ones

A spur of rock extends out into the canyon here; it is 25’ above the canyon floor. Six heqeti old ones inhabit it and the nearby cave. They are sensitive to the passage of the living due to the recent appearance of the kaliyani expedition (see 9-110); those dawdling in the northeastern approaches of the canyon are 50% likely to draw their attention. If visitors are concealed, extra-careful, and/or moving swiftly, then the old ones may remain un-alerted. Once alerted, the old ones will attack all below with volleyball-sized boulders (2-8 HP damage each) for 3-4 rounds before retreating to 9-111B. Unless visitors are consciously looking upward, the old ones here are likely to gain surprise (3 in 6 chance). 

The cave has some traces of worked floor (with geometric designs inset), plus a niche carved into the north wall. The niche holds (still!) a soapstone idol of Kauket, as a rising worm- or 
salamander-like thing with huge maw and slit eyes. It is oily and evil, but has no special powers; it could be sold to evil collectors for up to 250 gp.

6 heqeti old ones (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6+6; HP 47, 45, 40, 39, 38, 37; #AT 1 Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as spectres; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells.

Treasure:
Soapstone Kauket idol (250 gp).

##### 9-111b: West Cave and Ledge

Although this cave and ledge are initially unoccupied, the old ones from 9-111A will arrive here 3-4 rounds after initiating combat with those on the canyon floor. In addition, those who did not previously alert the old ones but spend time (with light and noise) investigating the colossus (9-110) will cause the old ones from 9-111A to move here and begin hurling stones at the intruders. The floor is worked, even if the walls show signs of cave-ins. A rough worked corridor extends west, but ends in a cave-in. One of Kerbog Khan’s dragonfly automatons (see new monsters) has been smashed into inoperative status here; if returned to Kerbog Khan (see SL12-25), the Khan will be grateful to the tune of four 300-gp gems or four pieces of useful Arden Vul related information. 

### 9-112: Ancient Heqeti Ruin

This battered structure is one of the few heqeti habitations that still stands; the others fell into ruin shortly after the rudishva attack. Half of this dwelling extends into the canyon; it is made of roughly shaped pieces of flint assembled into drystone walls. The roof of this portion collapsed years ago. The rest of the structure is delved into the side of the canyon. The door is long gone.

Within is a jumble of smashed ceramics, plus three stone vases inscribed with heqeti faces. Four sets of heqeti remains lie amid the rubble of the roof. None of them will become old ones, but their spirits still inhabit the space as a poltergeists. The poltergeists act mostly as a pest by throwing objects, creating sudden noises, and causing puffs of air. Unlike regular poltergeists, however, these are turned as spectres so long as they remain in the canyon area 
(9-108A to 9-126). They follow intruders throughout the region, causing mischief and hoping to alert the old ones by their actions.

4 poltergeists: SZ M; AL LE; AC 10; MV 60’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4, 3, 2, 1; #AT 0; Dmg special. Special attacks: throw object, a hit causes fear (throws as a 5 HD creature). Special defenses: 
invisible; silver, or +1 or better weapons to hit. Turned as spectres.

##### 9-112a: Ledge with Old Ones

Four more heqeti old ones wait patiently on this ledge, which sits 20’ above the chasm floor. They are armed with spears and rocks; after 2-3 rounds of hurling rocks, they leap down on their foes to engage hand-to-hand.

4 heqeti old ones (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6+6; HP 45, 40, 39, 38; #AT 1 Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as spectres; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells.

### 9-113: Ancient Heqeti Ruin with Shaky Roof

Like area 9-112, this structure is partly free-standing within the canyon, and partly embedded in the canyon wall. The external walls are the same drystone construction, and, miraculously, its wood-and-slate roof is still in place. The wooden door, too, is still present, although it is badly stuck. It can easily be broken down (add one pip to the chance for any open doors roll), but doing so causes the roof to collapse within 3 rounds. The collapsing roof does 2-8 HP damage to any within the structure, and causes a great deal of noise. 

No furnishings remain, although a pair of fired ceramic tiles may be found after 1-2 turns of sifting through the rubble. One tile shows tiny heqeti figures surrounding a ziggurat on top of which sits an enormous salamander thing (Kauket, see new monsters). The other has some indecipherable tally marks (a primitive accounting system). Two corridor fragments lead to ancient cave-ins. A silver ritual club (250 gp) lies amid the debris.

### 9-114: Ancient Heqeti Tomb

This ancient heqeti tomb is set entirely into the canyon wall; its wooden door is battered and would open easily were it not for the pile of rocks that has been placed before it. 

The east wall of the tomb has largely collapsed. Shattered crockery and a pair of unadorned stone vases fill the floor. Two heqeti mummies inhabit the chamber and will pursue any who 
release them from their long entombment.

Stuck horizontally into the collapsed east wall is a beautifully carved 8’ pole; the carvings are all geometric and floral. The pole is actually the staff of the frog (see new magic items); this potent item is concealed under a dweomer that prevents it from registering as magic to detect magic spells. Dispel magic will remove the dweomer; identify cast on the staff will reveal its abilities as normal. 

2 mummies (heqeti): SZ M; AL LE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 8+3; HP 62, 58; #AT 1; Dmg 2-16. Special attacks: fear; rotting disease. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from magic weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis; turned as vampires.

Treasure:
Staff of the frog (see new magic items).

### 9-115: Cave and Ledges

This cave is located 30’ above the floor of the canyon. Six more heqeti old ones are present here. They hurl rocks at any causing noise at areas 9-113 or 9-114. Should a fight with the mummies at 9-113 spill into the canyon proper, half of the old ones will leap downward to confront intruders in melee. The southeast wall of the cave contains another ledge that stands 15’ above the tunnel leading to 9-117. 

6 heqeti old ones (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6+6; HP 47, 45, 40, 39, 38, 37; #AT 1 Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as spectres; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells.

### 9-116: Ledge

This ledge sits 15’ above the canyon floor. The inanimate remains of four heqeti old ones are stacked like cordwood against the east edge of the cave leading south. Two new coils of rope are attached to heavy iron staples set into the edge of the cave; the ropes are coiled (not hanging over the edge). Signs of the passage of a group of six-legged creatures (kaliyani) are evident in the sand and dust.

An invisible kaliyani scout (see new monsters) is posted here to watch for traffic in the canyon. If detected, or if intruders show extended interest in this ledge, the scout hastens to 9-118 to warn his comrades.

1 invisible kaliyani scout (see new monsters): for stats see 9-118.

### 9-117: Crossroads Cave

This cave features many exits. It is empty of inhabitants, despite the nearby presence of a kaliyani encampment (see 9-118).

### 9-118: Kaliyani Camp

A forward team of kaliyani (see new monsters) has established a base camp here from which to cautiously explore parts of the lower levels of Arden Vul. One sub-team has already exited the canyon via 9-108 and discovered the tunnel at 9-57 leading upwards to 8-23, 7-34 and 5-125.

The encampment takes advantage of an ancient heqeti pediment made of weathered stone blocks that rises 4’ above the cave floor. A square depression in the center of the pediment has collected several inches of dripwater. Hints that the cave once featured other worked areas abound: the eastern wall is shaped at one point, despite crumbling due to seismic activity in others; in addition, a flattened cobblestone path leads south only to end in a 
massive cave-in. 

The kaliyani have placed eight stones around the edge of the pediment; each stone has been enchanted with continual light. A large ouroboros symbol has been painted on the northwest wall. 

Eight kaliyani, led by Rivvep the sorcerer, inhabit the chamber. In addition to their personal equipment, they have three sacks made of mushroom fiber and creepers containing dried foodstuffs of subterranean origin; a small wooden keg of kaliyani refreshening liquid (see Arden Vul items); another wooden keg with water; a simple silver box containing 15 pearls (100 gp each); 6x 2-lb lumps of arcanum (see new magic items); 6 each of some slightly odd-
looking but functional pick-axes, shovels, and mauls; and 3 small, soapstone heqeti idols to long-forgotten gods (150 gp each). 

In addition, Rivvep carries a reed scroll from Tsilliv (SL9-77), magistra of the kaliyani consortium in Arden Vul. It reads, in Kaliyani Semi-glyphik, as follows: “You are to accomplish three tasks. First, reestablish contact with the Old Allies and offer them gifts in return for a permanent diplomatic mission. Second, locate the ancestral home of the People in the upper levels. Avoid the brutish ones who are said to dominate the middle levels. Third, secure the 
portal to the Astral that lies at the base of the chasm. Too much traffic has been detected coming through it. Our preference is for you to seize control of it, but should that prove impossible, you are to destroy it.” [GM Note: task one refers to the heqeti, e.g., those at 9-78; task two refers to the former kaliyani areas on Level 5 (e.g. 5-125), and makes mention of the varumani (‘brutish ones’); task three refers to the gate located at 9-51].

The kaliyani are exceptionally cautious and careful. If alerted to the imminent arrival of intruders, either by noise and light or by their scout (at 9-116), they will have darkened their 
lights and prepared an ambush. Assuming they have a turn of foreknowledge, Rivvep and Velerim will have conjured a 12-HD earth elemental to aid them. If intruders arrive in less than a turn, the chance for conjuration drops per the rules for kaliyani rituals (55% for 5 rounds, 45% for 3 rounds, etc.). If taken by surprise, the kaliyani attempt to negotiate, while biding time for a quick strike at the intruders; negotiations may be difficult as none speak 
Archontean or other ‘civilized’ tongues (although Rivvep does know comprehend languages).

### 9-119: Tunnel to SL9-37

This newly-dug tunnel wends its way steeply upward through a series of corkscrew turns. It debouches at SL9-37.

### 9-120: Cave with Debris 

The floor of this cave is an uneven mishmash of bits of pavement, broken segments of pillars, and fragments of broken statuary. The debris is covered with scorch marks and, due to its fragmentary and unstable nature, it is difficult to traverse. Amid the rubble two mostly intact statues remain, leaning in 30-degree angles to the floor. One is of a heqeti builder, pointing in front of itself, and the other is of a muscled heqeti hopper wielding a stone spear. The carving of each is primitive but impressive, with small touches of realism and well-articulated accent clothing and jewelry. If transported out of Arden Vul, each could be sold for 5,000 gp. 

One of the pieces of debris is a 6’-diameter stone basin that, despite its awkward placement among the debris, still holds several inches of odorless, viscous, clear liquid. This ‘sweat’ can be placed inside the mouths of the stone heads at 9-121.

The ledge leading to area 9-123 is 20’ above the floor; the lip is jagged and broken. 

GM Note: This area was once a finished hallway that connected 9-123 to 9-121. It was destroyed by the rudishva, and then suffered further damage due to seismic collapse.

## Level 9: 121 - 135

### 9-121: Ancient Shrine to Kauket

This large chamber is in much better shape than the other areas of the canyon region. The ceiling is 25’ tall, and is supported by a row of 4’-diameter pillars that flank the east and west walls. Notable in the chamber are a pair of grotesque stone faces carved into two of the pillars, a 15’x5’ pool in the center of the chamber, and a 15’-tall statue of Kauket in the northern corner.

The corpses of four ancient Archontean explorers who were slain by keqemandri lie among the pillars. The corpses are desiccated and inanimate, but still contain some valuables.

Stone Pillar Faces: The two pillars at the south edge of the room, at the end of the double row that once extended through 9-120 to 9-123, are carved as grotesque stone faces (like those at area 6-92). Each head is roughly humanoid, but contains some unusual amphibian-oid features, including bulbous eyes, slit noses and lolling tongues. The mouth of each head/face is open, revealing a 2’ oval compartment. If a flask-full of ‘sweat’ from the basin in 
9-122 (or the equivalent amount of the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet - see new magic items) is placed in any of the mouths, the tongue of that head will lick the nearest person (within 5’). Two effects are imparted: 1) the subject will be immune to acid effects from any of the servitors of Kauket (such as keqemandri – see new monsters) for 5-10 turns, and 2) the subject will be afflicted with an effect from the following table:

D10 Effect
1 Sweat uncontrollably for 7 days, -3 CHA, -1 to hit rolls
2 Temporary gills for 7 days, allowing subject to breathe underwater
3 Eyes grow disproportionately large for 3 days, -1 CHA but true seeing
4 Legs grow in power while arms atrophy for 3 days: MV increased by 30’, STR -1
5 Webbing between fingers and toes, 50% better swimming but -1 CHA
6 Comprehend amphibian tongues, for 7 days
7 Cursed (if Good), Blessed for 3 days if CE.  Nothing for other alignments
8 Sensitive to light for 7 days (-2 to all rolls), but gains infravision
9 Locate body of fresh water; knows route to pool-sized bodies of water (or larger) within 200’
10 Mark of Kauket: all 9 of the above, 1-3 of the effects are permanent.

Remove curse will remove any of the temporary negative effects, but the Mark of Kauket can only be removed via alter reality, miricle, limited wish or wish, or through the special favor of a good-aligned deity via the completion of a significant quest.Central Pool:  The pool in the center of the chamber is 15’ tall and 5’ wide, and is filled with murky, viscous brown sludge. Four slim columns of polished basalt are placed around the pool, one on each side; these 4’-tall columns are set obliquely (not perpendicular to the floor). 

The pool is (like area 6-104) an ancient summoning chamber devoted to Rimmaq-Isfet. In antiquity the heqeti would tie sacrifices to the oblique pillars and summon a worm of Qok (see new monsters) to devour the victim(s) in the name of Rimmaq-Isfet. Although no heqeti are left to perform the summoning rituals, a worm of Qok will appear within three rounds if any living flesh is immersed in the liquid of the pool.

Statue of Kauket: The statue of Kauket in the northern corner of the shrine is unusual for several reasons. First, it gleams with gold, silver, and precious metal, and appears completely untouched by the destruction and decay which otherwise marks the canyon area. Second, although recognizably Kauket, the statue has been constructed out of precious metals and in an artistic style completely unlike any of the other heqeti statuary in Arden Vul. The cylindrical, salamander-like body is formed of ebony, with short ebony forearms that end in gold, three-fingered hands. The head is made of solid silver, with saucer-shaped eyes of crimson coral, a slit nose formed of pieces of jet, and a gaping maw with teeth of diamond. The statue carries an ebony spear with a gold head. All the metalwork is without tarnish, and gleams as if new. On top of all this extravagance, dozens of pieces of clearly heqeti jewelry – 
rings of granite, small silver earrings, tufts of hair set into amber – have been attached to the spear and arms. The entire statue appears more like one of the garish human cult statues than the more usual and more primitive heqeti ones. The statue is incredibly valuable (60,000 gp), but also protected by Kauket itself. Should the statue be moved, or any piece of it removed, two keqemandri teleport in to punish the desecrators. Once (if?) the keqemandri have been defeated, the statue loses its potency and can be moved normally (although it is quite heavy).

GM Note: The strange artistic style of the statue requires comment. Researching the statue through a sage or extremely ancient books will reveal that the statue was clearly built by human hands, and that it dates to the very earliest days of Archontos, when the city was still ruled by an oligarchy of merchant-sorcerers; that is, it is about the same age as the famous compact of Ennius (see World of Archontos appendix). The implications of that information, 
however, are serious, for it suggests that Kauket was known to the early Archonteans. Indeed, the statue was constructed by a cult of evil proto-Archonteans, who knew Kauket as the ‘Writhing Master’ and as ‘Caecus Caucius’ (i.e., “Blind Kauket”). Following signs offered by Kauket himself, this sect brought the statue to Arden Vul in the days when it was ruled by the heqeti. Remnants of this cult still exist in the capital city of Archontos, where, in the deepest cellars underneath the imperial palace, rituals to supplicate the entity now called “Tuphlo-Kaukos” are still conducted. Bringing the statue to sale in an Archontean market would thus attract the notice of this small, but powerful cult, and could lead to trouble for the sellers. It might also lead to a dangerous trip to Archontos itself, where hardy PCs would have to navigate the politics of the imperial court as well as the deadly sorcerous rituals of the cult.

### 9-122: Sweating Side Chamber

This chamber is sheathed in white marble squares (5’ square) on all sides, floor and ceiling. The floor is slightly convex, dipping towards a 10’-diameter basin placed in the middle of the floor (much like area 3-117). Each square of marble has a symbol incised in its center and filled with gold inlay. The symbols are identical: an open, toothless mouth, from which extends a thick tongue. All of the marble tiles are slick with dripping moisture; close examination will determine that the moisture beads up on each incised tongue, only to drip off or down, eventually collecting in the basin. Not surprisingly, the chamber is quite slippery. All movement is halved, and the incautious should roll 3d6 under DEX to keep their footing. Anyone slipping has a chance to end up in the basin, where he or she will be affected by multiple doses of the sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (see new magic items). 

### 9-123: The Hall of Thirty-Six Pillars

A ledge some 20’ above the floor of area 9-120 leads to this tee-shaped hall. Thirty-six heavy stone pillars 4’ in diameter define the hall. The ceiling is 15’ tall between the pillars and the walls, but rises to 30’ in a barrel arch in the center of the hall. The walls and pillars are formed of pebbled stone, and seem worn and even a little greasy. The eastern and western edges of the hall end in serious cave-ins.

The pillars radiate so strongly of magic that it need not be detected; the effect is of dread (-3 morale rolls for retainers, -1 to all saves to everyone for 1-4 hours). 

Scattered about the hall are the skeletons of twenty-four ice toads. The skeletons are inert until the Old Father (see 9-126) engages in combat, at which point they animate (eight per round) to aid him against interlopers.

Excessive noise in this area has a 20% chance of drawing the Old Father from 9-126 to investigate.

24 ice toad skeletons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’ plus 60’ hop; HD 3; HP 22(x4), 20(x4), 18(x6), 16(x6), 14(x4); #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: cold blast (2-12 
damage every other round). Special defenses: edged weapons do half damage; turned as spectres, or wights if the Old Father has been destroyed.

### 9-124: Preparation Chamber

The door to this oddly-shaped chamber has been blasted open by a powerful source of energy. Within are four stone tables and the remains of a half dozen heqeti. The yellowed bones show signs of charring (from rudishva energy weapons). The remains are inert.Secret Door (south): The secret door is normal to locate. It opens by applying brute force (open doors check) to cause the stone door to swing inward on a pin.

Treasure:
Amid the detritus are three jade ceremonial knives (575 gp each), two small jade bowls (325 gp each), and seven black pearls (500 gp each).

### 9-125: Stairs Up to SL6-4a

These narrow, primitive stairs wend their way upward in a pattern of squarish rises until they reach the tiny, forgotten heqeti observation post at SL6-4A.

### 9-126: Lair of the Heqeti Old Father 

Although this area used to form the eastern end of area 5-123, major seismic activity has rendered it isolated and only accessible via a narrow tunnel. The flagstone floor is buckled and cracked. Two primitive heqeti teleport wells are still visible amid the crumbling walls; these are no longer operational, however, and can never be repaired. The northeast and southeast walls bear simple images scratched into the stone; one shows a crowd of heqeti standing around a giant worm, while the other shows three heqeti receiving the obeisance of a dozen others.

Among the debris from the collapsed walls are the remains of a dozen heqeti; these appear as piles of yellowed and brittle bones. 

While the entire chamber radiates evil, a paladin or lawful good cleric will be able (after one round of reflection) to pinpoint the source of the evil; it emanates from one particular pile of 
remains, located just inside the collapsed corridor to the east.

Those remains are those of the Old Father (see new monsters), a terrible undead spirit whose spirit inhabits this chamber and whose evil empowers the lesser undead of the canyon region. Should the Old Father’s remains be hallowed, either by spell or by sprinkling holy water on them, its powers will be greatly weakened (see entry in new monsters appendix for specifics). 

The Old Father does not usually wander about. Still, undue noise in area 9-123 has a 20% chance to draw him there. He will also pursue intruders throughout the canyon area (9-109 to 9-126). Once aroused, the Old Father’s evil causes the ice toad skeletons in 9-123 to animate; they join him in combat wherever he may be.GM Note: The Old Father was the Great Tongue of this area at the time of the rudishva attack. He died here, but returned in undead form. His presence is responsible for the Old Ones and other undead in the canyon area.

The heqeti Old Father (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 0 or 6; MV 90’; HD 10+3; HP 71; #AT 1; Dmg special. Special attacks: maze; energy drain. Special defenses: ethereal; +2 or 
better weapons to hit; turned as a lich.

Treasure:
Among the heqeti remains are the following: 20 pieces of shaped crimson coral (100 gp each), 5 large aquamarines carved to resemble tadpole-like things (750 gp each), and 7 pieces of exceptional white jade carved to resemble salamanders (300-600 gp each).

With the Old Father’s remains: a carved jade necklace worth 5,000 gp; an incised jade bracelet worth 2,500 gp; and a rod of lordly might made out of ebony.

### 9-127: Sand Bar in the Rimpled Run

A rocky outcrop located in the midst of the Rimpled Run has acquired a thin layer of soil and sand. A few interesting items have washed up on the sandbar over the years, including the head of an ancient Archontean general lost from a marble statue (50 gp); a clever teak puzzle box with a petrified egg inside it (50 gp; successful roll of 4d6 under INT to open); a tarnished silver ewer (25 gp); a soggy quire from a spell book with the magic user spells 
phase door and simulacrum; and the battered remains of a basic exploration automaton of Kerbog Khan (see new monsters), which was destroyed by the demonic hunters at 9-50 and tossed into the river. Returning the automaton’s remains to the Khan delivers a reward, namely four 300-gp gems or four pieces of useful Arden Vul related information.

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the sand bar will be swept clear. After 7-10 hours, the river will recede to normal level, leaving a thin layer of muck covering the sand.

### 9-128: Tomb of Agaperion Martel

The first steps leading to this simple tomb are frequently awash in river water. The stone door to the tomb is stuck in a partly open position; it shows signs of serious damage. Within is the looted tomb of the archon, Agaperion, nicknamed ‘the Hammer’ (Martel). Frescoes cover all the walls, but they are nearly illegible due to moisture and age. Careful study of the west wall might reveal the name “Agaperion, Archon of Arden Vul” beneath a faded and stained image of a clean-shaven Archontean.

Three marble sarcophagi stand in the center of the chamber; the shattered lids of all three are scattered across the floor. All three feature impressive medium-relief carvings in a 2’ band around all sides. The carvings on two sarcophagi are military in nature, showing Archontean legionaries in combat against heqeti and other monstrous foes: on one, the leader is an archon, wielding a large military hammer (Agaperion), while on the other the leader is a young scutarion dressed in military gear (Agaperion’s son). The third sarcophagus features women in a mourning procession towards an ibis-headed god, led by a noble-looking Archontean lady (Agaperion’s wife). 

The floor contains a moldy layer of scattered remnants of tomb contents and furnishings – rotted wooden furniture, scraps of linen, bones, etc. 

Although the destruction is near total, the sarcophagi are extremely valuable, as the carved marble is of the highest quality. Each sarcophagus is worth 20,000 gp, but is extremely heavy (over 1,000 lb, or a half a ton).

GM Note: Agaperion was the archon of Arden Vul about 1,370 years ago. He was a warrior archon, easily smiting a tentative heqeti resurgence near the ziggurat. In an effort to promote Archontean activity at the foot of the chasm, he built his tomb here.

### 9-129: Ledge

This 5’-wide opening in the cave wall lies 20’ above the surface of the Rimpled Run. It is easy to miss unless explorers search carefully.

### 9-130: Broken Heqeti Hallway

A lost, frightened, and unlucky adventurer crouches in this hallway, sobbing quietly. The adventurer, Justine Two-Hands, is the sole survivor of a party that grew lost in the Nether Reaches (Level 8). After her comrades perished, Justine fell victim to the memory trap at 8-111; she eventually found her way down the tunnel at 8-110 to 9-150, where she fled the hydras and worked her way upriver. She is wounded and terrified, and will gratefully accept 
assistance. In addition to lacking her memory, Justine has also fallen victim to the cursed door at 9-136; as a result her alignment currently detects as NE despite the fact that she is really NG. Given her memory loss, general inability to explain herself, and this curse, she may well appear as an evil NPC trying to insinuate herself into the party.

Justine Two-Hands, 6th-level female Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL “NE” (really NG); AC 4; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 27 (max 60); #AT 1; Dmg 5-14 (two-handed sword +1) or 2-5 (heavy 
crossbow). Abilities: STR 18/25, INT 10, WIS 16, DEX 9, CON 16, CHA 7. Possessions: chainmail +1; two-handed sword +1; heavy crossbow with 11 bolts; two days of rations; a purse with 37 sp and 15 gp; and a 3-lb chunk of arcanum (see new magic items).

### 9-131: Tunnel Up to SL2-6

This long tunnel climbs steeply through some ascending loops and mini-cliffs before extending north for several hundred feet to connect with SL2-6. 

### 9-132: Tomb of Marcion Aoratus: Entrance

This tomb seems comparable to that of Agaperion (9-128). A set of stairs rises from the river to a battered stone door stuck in a partly-opened position. Within are two plain granite sarcophagi, the lids of which are broken on the floor. The walls are covered with mildewed and barely-visible frescoes of imperial administrators and military scenes. The central scene on the north wall seems to depict an archon wearing the robes of a sorcerer, gesturing with a wand. An inscription in Mithric on the base of one of the sarcophagi reads: “Marcion the archon, called Aoratus for his ability to appear and disappear at will. Per his request, this tomb was created for him.” Amid the litter on the floor are numerous bones, bits of worked stone, rotted leather, and rotted wood. In addition, 47 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) can be found among the detritus. Close examination of the bones might reveal that none are from a human; rather, they come from animals.

Secret Door (south): The door would be easy to detect, were it not concealed with a permanent illusion. Only by dispelling the illusion can the door be properly found. Once found, it opens easily by pushing it inward. The corridor beyond is narrow (5’) and climbs steeply up a long flight of stairs.

### 9-133: Tomb of Marcion Aoratus: False Tomb

A basalt sarcophagus dominates this 12’-tall tomb chamber. The walls were once covered with frescoes above and below a 3’-tall register of high-relief marble sculpture that circles the room at eye-height. While the frescoes are merely smears of ruined color, the relief carvings are vivid and impressive. They depict seven scenes of an archon’s life: reviewing a line of legionaries, sitting in judgment in a court chamber, presiding over an impalement execution, conducting a solemn religious procession, reading the auspices, receiving dignitaries and their gifts, and marching at the head of a column of troops. 

The sarcophagus is equally impressive, featuring a gisant-style image of Marcion carved into the lid, and the words ‘Marcion, Archon’ on all four sides. The sarcophagus is trapped with explosive runes. Within the sarcophagus are a set of bones (not Marcion’s), carefully wrapped in yellow silk (110 gp), as well as 57 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items), 379 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), and a set of fifteen gold shabti figurines (125 gp each).

Trap (explosive runes): The lid of the sarcophagus is trapped with explosive runes.

Secret Compartment: Behind the sculpture depicting the impalement ceremony is a hollow compartment, 3’ tall, 5’ deep, and 6’ long. The compartment is detected normally, but can only be opened by destroying or carefully removing the marble sculpture. Within are a second set of bones, also wrapped in yellow silk (110 gp), with a platinum rod of authority (350 gp), a gold and onyx signet ring (350 gp), and a scroll of protection from undead. These bones are also not Marcion’s, but rather are another red herring designed to keep tomb robbers from locating the true tomb.

Secret Door (east wall of corridor): This secret door is difficult to locate (1 in 8); it can only be opened by destroying the thin stone ‘door’ panel.

### 9-134: Tomb of Marcion Aoratus: True Tomb

Marcion’s actual bones rest within this 12’-tall chamber. The walls are undecorated, and the chamber is dominated by a simple, uncarved marble sarcophagus. Surrounding it are seventeen 24”-tall onyx shabti figurines. In addition, four 8’-tall granite figures of jackal-headed humans bearing axes stand in the corners of the chamber. An inscription in 2’-tall, silver-filled Mithric letters runs across the south wall; it reads, ‘Marcion, the great archon. Whether seen or unseen, he is always present.’

Disturbing the lid of the sarcophagus causes the spirit of Marcion to animate. The spirit is an Archontean animating ghost (see new monsters) and is ethereal, although visible as a vague 
outline to those on the Prime Material Plane. Marcion’s spirit can animate any of the stone figurines into which it manifests for a round. The spirit can only be damaged itself during the round after it exits a particular figurine, or at any time by those capable of entering the ethereal plane. It must wait 1-2 rounds after exiting a figurine before animating another. It animates the four jackal-headed statues first, before turning to the shabti figurines. 

Inhabitants:

Marcion, an Archontean animating ghost (see new monsters): SZ M; AL NE; AC 8 or 2; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 51; #AT 0; Dmg 0; MR 25%. Special: animate stone statues or figurines. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit.

4 jackal-headed stone warriors, as enhanced Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8; HP 58, 55, 53, 50; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.

17 Archontean animated constructs - shabti warriors (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 13(x17); #AT 1; Dmg 3-8; MR 25%. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons (but double-damage from crushing weapons); immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells.

Treasure:
Inside the sarcophagus: 273 ancient octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items); 1,137 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items); 3,753 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items); eight green tourmalines (100 gp each); and Marcion’s rod of rulership.

### 9-135: Island in the Rimpled Run

A small island covered with sand and silt rises 5-10’ above the Rimpled Run in this location. A 5’ statue occupies the southwestern end, while a 9’-tall carved pillar stands to the northeast end.

The statue depicts an Archontean legionary standing with her feet shoulder-width apart. The legionary rests her spear on the ground with her left hand; her right arm is extended in the 
universal gesture of ‘stop’. The statue is marble, but is badly stained and worn from the river and other damage. Just visible on a plinth that has been bolted to the island is the word ‘Forbidden!’

The pillar is almost as thick (8’) as it is tall (9’). It radiates an obvious and brooding evil and exudes a chill in a 5’ radius. Carved in a spiral fashion, the narrative register depicts the triumph of the heqeti followers of Rimmaq-Isfet (much like the pillar at 3-178). Given its antiquity and the moisture in this region, many of these carvings are now little more than faceless lumps. Still, careful perusal of the column reveals some information, albeit at a 
potentially stiff price. 

Should any being not of chaotic evil alignment or otherwise girded with an appropriate token – e.g., a heqeti ring (see new magic items) – touch the pillar, a keqemander demon gates in to confront the intruders (see new monsters). Simply examining the pillar will cause dizziness, and possibly confusion (save vs. spells to avoid). Any able to keep their eyes on the pillar might learn one of the following bits of information:

D10 Result
1-2

A colossal salamander fills the top of the pillar. It has multiple legs, and an enormous mouth filled with teeth and circled with a ‘beard’ of feelers/tentacles. Three lidless eyes span its massive brow.

3-4

Hopping salamander-headed bipeds wreak destruction on lizards

5-6

Humans in chains are driven into the maw of a giant amphibian

7-8

The boundary separating the spiraling narratives is in fact a tongue

9-10

The heqeti and their slaves seem to be moving towards a ziggurat in a cave.

It will take an hour of scrutiny to learn all of this information. Anyone who successfully gleans even one piece of information from the column has a flat 50% chance of recognizing the origin of Kauket artifacts and structures found elsewhere in Halls (e.g. pukel-manders, tears of Kauket, etc.), and a flat 33% chance of intuiting a relationship between Rimmaq-Isfet and Kauket. Such an ability does not allow one to intuit specific uses or functions of such objects, but does allow one to state with authority something along the lines of “That [whatever] is part of the demonic fishy-amphibian cult. I saw something similar on that blasted pillar!” Forewarned is forearmed, after all.

Note: Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the island will be swept clear of everything except the statue and the pillar. After 7-10 hours, the river will recede to normal level, leaving a thin layer of sticky muck on the island.

1 keqemander demon (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC -2; MV 90’, 150’ flying (Class D); HD 12; HP 75; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/3-18; MR 40%. Constant abilities: dread (-1 to saves); 
infravision. Special attacks: acid spit (3-10 dmg; 30’ range, every other round); cause fear; darkness (10’ radius); exude acid with chance to degrade armor; use a symbol of discord. 
Special defenses: only hit by magic weapons; half damage from cold, electricity, fire, and gas; become invisible. Special: levitate; telekinesis (4,000 gp weight); project image; teleport without error; 50% chance to gate in either another keqemander or a Type I-IV demon.

Treasure:
A few items have washed up on the island: a cursed shield -1, missile attractor; a scroll case holding a copy of the epic adventure story, Fraternal Triumph: Taticus and Thekla against the Troll (see Arden Vul books); and a rather primitive statuette made of gold, with a solid gold body and limbs but with a head formed of three ancient Archontean solidi welded and melted together (worth 125 gp for the metal, or 430 gp to a very particular collector).

## Level 9: 136 - 150

### 9-136: Ledge with Trapped Door

A worked ledge rising 5’ out of the river leads to a stone door. The door is wizard locked (at 10th level of casting), and contains a deeply-incised inscription in Mithric.

The inscription takes the form of a 3’-diameter circle. A 6” register of text runs around the outer edge; within are a pair of eyes and a nose (but no other facial features). The inscription reads: “An archon towards his subjects, a legionary to his comrades, the faithful to their god, a husband to his wife, a mother to her children.”

While the nose contains an obvious keyhole, the key is long gone. The only current way to open the door is to recognize the inscription as a riddle and speak the answer aloud in Mithric. The answer to the riddle is “love.”

Trap (Curse): Touching or manipulating the door in any way imposes a curse on the manipulator. The curse causes the aura of the victim’s alignment to change to its diametric opposite. To be clear, the victim’s alignment itself does not change, merely the ‘reading’ offered by spells like detect alignment. In the case of true neutral, the new alignment reading is determined randomly. As this is a fairly subtle curse, the victim may not be aware that he/she has been cursed for some time. The curse can be removed, but only by remove curse cast at the 10th-level or greater. The trap might be detected by a thief (-10% chance), but it cannot be disarmed. Dispel magic cast at 10th level or above will remove it.

Note: Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the ledge will be swept clear. After 7-10 hours, the river will recede to normal level, leaving a thin layer of muck on the floor of the ledge.

### 9-137: Half-Finished Chamber

Abandoned shortly after it was begun, this chamber was intended to be the tomb of Marcion Aoratus’s successor, Hecatia the Younger. The project was abandoned when the chief architect was slain in the tomb by unknown forces and Hecatia’s interests turned elsewhere. 

The chamber is a rough-hewn enlargement of a natural cave. Architect’s chalk marks, some small iron eye-hooks, and a ball of twine are scattered about the chamber. Three large granite slabs, about 4’x4’x7’ carved out of the rock of the floor, indicate the locations for future sarcophagi. The corpse of Halfdanios the Wiskin, an architect from the atelier of the great Phocion the Builder (see 8-142), is slumped over one of them. The corpse’s skull has been crushed by a heavy object; the rest of the remains have deliquesced into bone and sinew. A set of architect’s dividers and a fine hammer (35 gp total) rest near the corpse.

The tunnel to 9-138 was clearly bored from the west into this chamber; a small pile of rock rubble indicates this fact.

There is a 25% chance that a huldugritti (see new monsters) from 9-138 is present here, inspecting the rock for snacks.

1 huldugritti (see new monsters) (25% chance): SZ M; AL N; AC 0 or 2; MV 120’ or 60’; HD 8+8; HP 56; #AT 2 (in stone form); Dmg 2-16/2-16; MR 25%. Special attacks: hurl boulders 
(2-8 HP each). Special defenses: meld with stone (cure 3-24 HP); assume spirit form; +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire, electricity, and mind-affecting spells. 

### 9-138: Ore Seams and Huldugritti

This large natural cavern features lots of minor dips and rises in the floor, walls and ceilings. The reason for this is that the area contains extremely rich seams of silver and iron, and has attracted huldugritti for many centuries; their gnawing has carved the interesting features into the rock face. As they find arcanum indigestible, the huldugritti have carefully eaten around three large (25-lb) knobs of arcanum (see new magic items).

Two huldugritti (see new monsters) are present here at all times, unless one has previously been encountered at 9-137. In addition there is a 33% chance that if combat breaks out, a third huldugritti will appear.

2-3 huldugritti (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 0 or 2; MV 120’ or 60’; HD 8+8; HP 61, 58, 56; #AT 2 (in stone form); Dmg 2-16/2-16; MR 25%. Special attacks: hurl boulders (2-8 
HP each). Special defenses: meld with stone (cure 3-24 HP); assume spirit form; +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire, electricity, and mind-affecting spells. 

Treasure:
Three 25-lb knobs of arcanum (see new magic items).

### 9-139: Tunnel up to 8-95a

This tunnel rises in swoops and whorls at a rather precipitous pitch before joining the collapsed tunnel at 8-95A, near Zhorak’s forge. 

### 9-140: Croaking Pool, with Rock Fingers

The Rimpled Run forms a wide pool in this location. The pool is 60’ deep and filled with leafy, fronded pigment-less pondweeds. A large school of blind fish lives among the weeds. This microclimate is made possible by the geyser in 9-143, which makes both the air and the water here much warmer than normal. 

Four irregularly-shaped columns of pitted granite rise from floor to ceiling here. The ancient heqeti bored dozens of holes into the ‘fingers’, each 3”-7” in diameter; in them live a vociferous breed of small white frogs. They fill the air with a cacophony of croaking and peeping. 

Where the Rimpled Run leaves the pool in the northeast there is a short (5’) waterfall; the current is swift and dangerous from this point onwards (see 9-141).

There’s a 25% chance that the adolescent hydra from 9-143 is present here, swimming and feeding.

1 six-headed hydra (25%): see statistics at 9-143.

### 9-141: Rimpled Run, Lower Reaches

The Rimpled Run enters a narrower passage here, only 8’ in diameter. It also drops in elevation quickly and severely as it swings towards the south. These facts mean that navigation of the river past this point is much more difficult, as the current is swift and there is little head room above the water. An unprotected swimmer will take 10-60 HP damage from general buffeting before washing up at Level 10-31. Magical breathing assistance reduces the damage to 4-24 HP. Magical protection of the body eliminates all damage.

### 9-142: Beach with Stream

The overflow from the geyser in 9-143 runs down a gently-sloping, pebbled beach to join the Rimpled Run at 9-140. Scattered about the beach are a number of pieces of semi-valuable debris. There is a 10% chance that the six-headed hydra from 9-143 will be here. 

Should the dam on Sub-Level 6 (SL6-25) be destroyed, the beach will be inundated, and anything on it will have been swept away. After 7-10 hours, the river will recede to normal level, leaving a thin layer of sticky muck on the beach.

1 six-headed hydra (10%): see stats at 9-143.

Treasure:
Teak desktop (75 gp); two old helmets (5 gp); a Wiskin battle axe, a gold incense burner (35 gp), and a scroll case with a treasure map.

### 9-143: Hydra Cave, with Geyser

This large, 35’-tall cave is hot and steamy. A depression about 6’ deep occupies most of its eastern half. Within the depression a geyser of hot water erupts every turn; over the centuries this has filled the depression with warm, nitrogen rich water. 

The steamy water (along with feeding grounds in the surrounding caves and the pool at 9-140) has proven hospitable to a family of hydras, two adults with 11 and 9 heads respectively, and an adolescent with 6 heads.

Anyone within 30’ of the geyser when it erupts takes 4-24 HP of scalding damage (save vs breath weapons for half damage). The hydras are immune to the geyser.

Beneath the hot water is a carpet of mostly splintered and crunched bones, as well as some treasure. 

Within the western, relatively dry portion of the cave is a pile of sand strengthened by bones and bits of pond-weed. Within the pile are four hydra eggs (about 3’ long); two will produce males and two will produce females. There is a 10% chance that one of the eggs produces a lernaean hydra. While the eggs are valuable generally (10,000 gp each), King Weskenim (SL4-22) and the goblins will surrender their three flawless diamonds (total of 15,000 gp) in return for a female egg. 

1 11-headed hydra: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 11; HP 88; #AT 11; Dmg 1-10(x11).

1 9-headed hydra: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 9; HP 72; #AT 9; Dmg 1-8(x9).

1 6-headed hydra: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 48; #AT 6; Dmg 1-6(x6).

Treasure:
Under the water: 5,119 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), 2 aquamarines (500 gp each), an emerald (1,000 gp).

In the nest: four hydra eggs (10,000-15,000 gp each).

### 9-144: Skinks’s Cave

A large population of cave skinks lives in this and the surrounding caves. Their quickness allows them to get past the hydras most of the time, and the hydras’ size prevents them from squeezing into the narrower tunnels such as those between 9-143 and 9-144 and 9-149 and 9-148. 

Although the entire population numbers 35, only 15 will be encountered here. The skinks are always voracious and are likely to swarm foes.

15 cave skinks (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 16, 15, 14, 14, 13(x3), 12(x3), 11(x3), 10, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: toxic mucus.

### 9-145: Wet Cave with More Skinks

The floor of this cave is unusually cracked and uneven, and glistens with moisture. The air is humid and warm. Every five rounds two blasts of superheated steam from the same underground source as the geyser spray upwards from one of the cracks in the floor. Those 
in the cave take 3-18 HP damage, or half if a save versus breath weapons is successful. Ten more skinks inhabit this cave; they are adept at dodging the effects of the steam sprays.

10 cave skinks (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 13 12(x3), 11, 11, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: toxic mucus.

### 9-146: Ancient Garbage Heap

The floor of this hot and humid cave is covered by a layer of ancient trash derived from the old temple of Besa (8-119). The biological components of the trash heap mostly ossified centuries ago into hard and crunchy bits, which are mixed in with broken iron candelabra, badly bent bronze plates and ewers, soiled clothing, and so forth. The heap looks inviting, but in fact contains nothing of value save a silver and ebony statuette which takes 4-6 turns 
to locate. The cave skinks have found lots of routes through and under the heap, and are able to use the heap to gain surprise on the unsuspecting; they have a 1 in 3 chance to surprise. 

10 cave skinks (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 13 12(x3), 11, 11, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: toxic mucus.

Treasure:
A silver-and-ebony statuette of Besa in her squat, hermaphroditic manifestation (275 gp).

### 9-147: Tunnel up to 8-119

This tunnel spirals upward to join the ruined corridor near the temple of Besa at 8-119.

### 9-148: Cave with Dead Sortian

The skeletal corpse of a Sortian killed in antiquity lies in the center of this cave, still wearing its inert Sortian chain mail (see new magic items). The corpse’s hands still clutch a lesser salt lamp of protection (see new magic items). In an ancient leather satchel that has been gnawed upon by the cave skinks are four packets of essence for the lamp. 

Treasure:
Sortian chain mail (see new magic items); a short sword, a mace, a lesser salt lamp of protection (See new magic items) with four packets of essence (see new magic items), a bag of marbles, and a packet of chalk.

### 9-149: Cave of Carnage

This cave is warm and humid due to the geyser in 9-143. The corpses of six goblins are strewn about the cave, badly rent and torn. Five cave skinks (see new monsters) are feeding on the corpses. Producing noise or light here has a 33% chance of bringing 1-3 of the hydras from 9-143 to investigate.

The goblins discovered the path from 8-110 to 9-150, and were delighted to find hydras, as they would have loved to steal a hydra egg. Unfortunately they were slaughtered easily by the two adult hydras.

5 cave skinks (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 12, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: toxic mucus.

Treasure:
Among the corpses may be found 43 sp, 22 gp, a single ancient octagonal platinum coin (see Arden Vul items), six spears, and a fine helmet.

### 9-150: Tunnel up to 8-110

This tunnel rises through a series of switchbacks to join area 8-110
