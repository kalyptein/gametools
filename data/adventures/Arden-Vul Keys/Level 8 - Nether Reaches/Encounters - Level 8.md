## General Encounter Tables

* 1-in-6 chance every 3 turns
	* The GM should use common sense with the chart.
		* Close to 8-69 and 8-70, giant bees should be very common; less likely the further the party is from the hives.
		* Housecats (more common near 8-30 to 8-50)
		* Heqeti (more common to the west of the level)
		* Etc

* For encounters in a bliss pollen area (8-63, 8-67 to 8-75, 8-80 to 8-83, 8-111, 8-113 to 8-115, 8-128 to 8-131), 75% the creatures are under the effects of the bliss pollen.
