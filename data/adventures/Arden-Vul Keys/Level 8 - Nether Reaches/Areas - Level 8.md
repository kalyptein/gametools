### Overview

The Nether Reaches have a reputation among denizens of Arden Vul as an ultra-dangerous ‘wild west’ region. As a result, no faction controls the level, nor is any faction genuinely interested in establishing a permanent presence here. To be sure, in antiquity most of the main cultures of Arden Vul established some presence on Level 8, but in each case that presence was limited, and even secret in some cases. It was thus frequently a truism that ‘to 
seek the Nether Reaches’ meant to strike out on one’s own into the dangerous and unknown areas far outside the control of the authorities. In the present, the Nether Reaches retain their aura of mystery and opportunity. Rumors of some of the infamous ‘special’ locations persist, and both denizens of the Halls and hardy outsiders frequently mount expeditions to the Reaches, usually in search of a fabled location or object. It must be said, however, that 
most of these expeditions never return to the more ‘civilized’ areas. 

The level contains several special encounter areas, interspersed with natural tunnels and broken fragments of older habitation. Among the notable regions are the domain of the shadow lord, Laocoon (8-8 to 8-21); the temple of Bastet (8-30 to 8-41); the cave of the bliss flowers (8-67), with the nearby hives of giant bees (8-69 and 8-70); the terrible hall of the chaotic feasters (8-76), with its direct access to the greater god entity Rimmaq-Isfet; the forge of Zhorak (8-95 to 8-104); the tomb of Phocion the Builder (8-142 to 8-144); Eustachius the Cantor’s famous Singing Grotto (8-146 to 8-148); and the lost temple of Besa (8-119 to 8-126). While this may seem to represent a convenient conjunction of plunderable of riches, magic, and lore, explorers of the Nether Reaches face two problems: first, many of these special areas are guarded by powerful entities; second, and perhaps more importantly, travel between the entrance halls (8-1 to 8-7) and the rest of the level is notoriously difficult. 

Of course, travel from the entrance hall is easy in one sense, for explorers can use teleporters in that hall to access distant sections of the Reaches (see 8-7). Perhaps it is more accurate, then, to say that travel out of the Reaches to safer areas has proven the major obstacle to adventurers. Escape from the level is rendered difficult both because of the circuitous tunnels that wend through the level, but also because of the mind-altering pollen of the bliss 
flowers (see new flora) that affects most of the central areas of the level. The potent bliss pollen is responsible for confounding even the most well-organized exploring parties by separating them, turning them around, and leading them into unforeseen dangers (see below at region 3 for those areas affected by the pollen).

Significant Regions of Level 8

Entrance and Shadowed Halls (Areas 8-1, 8-3 to 8-21)
* Almost all expeditions to the Nether Reaches commence in this compact region of mostly Archontean-era construction. Most visitors arrive via the troll lift (8-1). Depending on the intelligence they have previously garnered, explorers have several choices. They can venture north, either to cross the lesser chasm (8-27) in the direction of the temple of Bastet (8-30 to -841) or to risk the ambush of Nicetas and Co. (8-4 and 8-5). They can also venture east, to the entrance hall (8-7); there they can either push past the safety of the torch of Anubis (8-7) into the darkened halls beyond, or can use one of the one-way teleporters to head deeper into the Nether Reaches (8-7A to 8-7H).
* Factions
	* The varumani maintain a cursory presence at area 8-1 in the person of Ecath, the most junior member of Troll Lifts staff. The areas east of the entrance hall (8-7), that is, areas 8-8 to 8-21, are under the control of a powerful shadow lord (8-15). An Archontean bandit, Nicetas, occupies area 8-5, from which he ambushes unwary explorers.
* Construction
	* Although the area was occupied by heqeti and rudishva, the construction here dates from the Archontean era.
* Environment
	* Area 8-8 is under several permanent darkness spells, a fact that renders the shadows and vorantes demons more dangerous. Only the light of the torch of Anubis (8-7) prevents them from occupying the western portion of the region.

Temple of Bastet (8-30 to 8-41)
* A strange vestige of the ancient Archontean glory days exists in this temple devoted to the goddess, Bastet. During the war of Sortians and Theosophs (see World of Archontos appendix), the priestesses of Bastet refused to aid the anti-Sortian archon of Arden Vul and fled to the Nether Reaches, where they established a new - and secret - temple, one that remains in operation to the present. The temple is protected by several natural chokepoints (e.g., 8-30), and the priestesses are vigilant in defending their territory from monsters and/or hostile adventurers. The large colony of feral cats that inhabits the tunnels near the temple serves as a warning system for the priestesses. Although old and rich, the temple has remained secret; for this reason it is not considered an iconic location of the Halls.
* Factions
	* The priesthood of Bastet (8-31, 8-32, 8-37) controls this area fully. The priestesses are not necessarily hostile to those who approach humbly and with demonstrated need, but they are rightfully suspicious of adventurers and require assurances before allowing visitors into their fane.
* Construction
	* The construction is late-Archontean era stonework, with much imagery devoted to cats.
* Environment
	* Many chambers within the temple precincts (i.e., 8-31, 8-32, 8-37, and 8-38) are affected by the new spell, nighteyes of Bastet (see new spells); this spell provides true moonlight to these areas, thus allowing the priestesses to assume maubaste form (see new monsters). In addition, the outer temple (8-38) is under the effect of a hallow spell (see new spells), which sanctifies the area for those of chaotic neutral alignment (+2 to all rolls for those of CN alignment; -2 to all rolls for all others).

Caves of Bliss (Areas 8-63, 8-67 to 8-75, 8-80 to 8-83, 8-111, 8-113 to 8-115, 8-128 to 8-131)
* This region is marked less by architecture or habitation than by environmental effects. Its center is the vast, magically sunlit cavern of the bliss flowers (8-67), from which the pollen spreads to surrounding areas, both worked and unworked.
* Factions
	* No factions control this region.
* Construction
	* Most of this region is comprised of natural caves and tunnels; the few worked areas are Archontean in origin.
* Environment
	* Areas with bliss pollen are dangerous since the pollen induces psychotropic effects. Those breathing the pollen must save versus petrification (with a -3 penalty) or wander in a random direction, blissfully unaware of their surroundings, for 1-6 hours. 

Forge of Zhorak (8-95 to 8-100, plus mines at 8-87 to 8-94)
* Although an iconic location in the halls, knowledge of the site’s location has been lost for close to a millennium. The few explorers who have managed to locate the forge have all perished, including a recent group of adventurers who had the misfortune to be ambushed by a group of doppelgangers posing as dwarves (8-100). The region includes the forge proper (8-100), as well as associated storage, design, display, and habitation chambers. While the doppelgangers form the most immediate threat here, the forge is still protected by a fearsome iron golem (8-100A). A network of mineral-rich tunnels is linked to the worked areas; although still rich with ore, the tunnels are also home to several huldugritti (see new monsters) and inert Zhorak’s miners (see new monsters; they could be activated in certain circumstances). 
* Factions
	* No faction controls this region, although a group of doppelgangers posing as dwarves has just reached the area, with the goal of destroying the forge itself.
* Construction
	* All areas are Archontean, albeit in a unique style that is the product of Zhorak’s dwarven predilection.
* Environment
	* There are no unusual environmental effects in operation here.

Lost Temple of Besa (8-119 to 8-126)
* This region was notorious even in antiquity, thanks to the sometimes-perverse practices and rituals associated with Besa, the ancient Archontean deity of sexual pleasure and pain. Although scholars of Arden Vul history know of the existence of the temple, its location has been lost to time (with the exception perhaps of the most formidable sages). As a result, experienced adventurers consider it one of the holy grails of Arden Vul exploration, one perfect for jokes and knowing winks. The priesthood expired a millennium ago, however, and the region has fallen into the hands of three powerful and extremely clever rakshasas.
* Factions
	* No factions control this region, although it is occupied by three rakshasas masquerading (through illusion) as well-heeled rudishva survivors.
* Construction
	* All stonework is Archontean.
* Environment
	* The area appears well-maintained, and even luxurious, thanks to illusions maintained by the rakshasas that have occupied the region. The illusions are particularly strong in areas 8-120 to 8-124.

## Level 8: 1 - 15

### 8-1: Troll Lift, Up to 6-1

This hall is the debarkation site for the eastern Troll Lift (6-1). Passengers descending the 400’ from Level 6 reach this location after a descent taking 11-20 minutes and costing 10 sp per leg.

Like other halls opening into the Great Chasm (8-2), this chamber was carved by the heqeti millennia ago, and as a result the pebbled walls are slightly oily to the touch and detect faintly of evil. The floor is paved with blue granite. Here the lift appears solely as a set of ropes looped around a pulley set into the floor; to secure passage up the chasm, one must shout to get the attention of Reith (6-1) or get Ecath to sound his horn. After 11-20 minutes the basket will appear and travelers step aboard. A return trip of the same duration is necessary to travel the 400’ up to Level 6, at which point Reith collects the tariff for passage (10 sp per leg).

Ecath, a true varumani (see new monsters), is the lone representative of the troll thegn (7-30) in this location. His title is ‘apprentice overseer of the Troll Lifts’, but even Ecath recognizes a dead-end posting when he sees it. Dismayed at his prospects, Ecath has struck a secret bargain with Nicetas and his gang of robbers (8-5). Nicetas forks over 10% of all proceeds, and in return Ecath guides suitable marks towards area 8-5. Ecath hopes to use his growing stash of valuables to buy his way into the favor of the troll thegn (7-30). 

Ecath would also love to take credit for some discovery or new source of wealth, as he hopes this might be his ticket out of the tedium he faces here. As a result, Ecath appears curious and engaging, hoping to elicit something valuable from any visitors.  Ecath knows a bit about the closer areas of the Nether Reaches. For instance, he knows that there is an old temple to the north (Temple of Bastet, areas 8-30 to 8-41); he also knows that those venturing east into area 8-7 had better have good sources of light. He claims to know nothing about robbers nearby (8-5), since he is on Nicetas’s payroll.

Ecath has two cauldrons on tripods. One is a tripod of heating (see new magic items); the other holds the revenues from the troll lift (2,936 sp, and 328 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items). Ecath has an impressive horn taken from some devil that he uses to alert Reith (6-1) to lower the basket. The horn is not magical, but is worth 3,100 gp. 

Secret Compartment (north wall): Ecath has also used his down time to carve a small secret hole in the wall behind a loose stone. The compartment is detected as a secret door. Here he keeps the loot delivered to him by Nicetas per their arrangement. There is a 1 in 6 chance that another other group is present in this chamber. Roll on the following table to determine its composition:

### 8-2: Great Chasm

One of the iconic features of the Halls, this massive fissure extends through most of the dungeon levels and provides a sure, if difficult, means of vertical navigation of the Halls. The fissure is generally shaped like a triangular prism, with its apex about 50’ above Level 2. The prism extends downward 1,600’ through the Halls until it levels out at the floor of the chasm (9-1) hundreds of feet below. The chasm is slightly wider on this level than it was on Level 7. Other than the troll lift (8-1) and the spur (8-27) that separates 8-3 from 8-28, the chasm is not a major feature of the Nether Reaches.  Random encounters use the following table; roll every three turns, with a 1 in 6 chance for an encounter.

### 8-3: Southern Landing

Originally nothing more than a widening of Archontean-era tunnels, this chamber is now more significant as the last ‘safe’ area on the south side of the east-west ‘spur’ of the Great Chasm (8-27). The room’s original decorations are gone, effaced by time, dirt, and considerable graffiti. Some of the graffiti has been painted over with black paint, but much is still visible (Nicetas’s men paint over any references to their gang – see 8-5). The northern lip of this area, by the edge of the spur has six spikes set into the floor; to these spikes are attached ropes of various length (used by previous explorers to cross the spur).
D20 Graffiti (Language) Notes

1

Big Reward for News of Muq. Tell Gog. (Varumani)

A reference to the intrigue that caused Gog (5-2) to be exiled from the court of the troll thegn (7-75). Muq is located at 8-151. The thegn (7-30) will also pay a reward for incriminating information on Muq.

2

Image of a cat-headed woman. Below, in black paint is scrawled “Ipwet" (Elvish).

A reference to Ipwet, priestess of Bastet (8-32). Also a hint about her nature as a maubaste

5

Reith is a big ape who steals all the money! Tell the thegn! 
(Varumani)

Those dwarves we encountered were surly. Only one would speak with us. Damned dwarves. (Archontean)

An oblique reference to the false dwarves at 8-100(really doppelgangers)

### 8-4: Hall of Ambushes

This long chamber is brightly lit by several continual light spells cast on the ceiling. It is littered with skeletons and partially-decomposed corpses. The stench of death is strong. Under all the debris is a beautiful, 10’-diameter mosaic depicting a yellow hoplite helmet (an imperial symbol); unusually, the yellow tesserae are actually bits of gold (total of 475 gp worth).

Three arrow slits occupy the north wall, as does a lowered portcullis. Nicetas and his robbers (8-4) use these apertures to ambush those who approach their domain. The robbers wait until a party has fully entered the chamber before launching their attacks.

Almost nothing of value may be found here, since Nicetas’s men assiduously loot the dead bodies. Still, the robbers have never noticed that a desiccated human hand rests flush with the ceiling in the northwestern corner. Unless visitors expressly state that they are examining the ceiling, it is likely to be overlooked. The hand wears a ring of levitation (see new magic items), which accounts for its strange positioning.

Secret Door (east): The door is normal to detect. It is locked, and the key is held by Nicetas. Attempts to pick the lock are at +5%.

Treasure:
Ring of levitation (see new magic items).

### 8-5: Nicetas and Co., Robbers

A band of robbers led by Nicetas the Aesthete makes its home in this well-protected chamber. A sturdy iron portcullis separates the lair from area 8-4; the lever operating the portcullis is on the floor next to the portcullis. The door leading north is brand new and in good repair. It is also locked and barred from this side; Nicetas holds the key.

Typically Nicetas keeps the main part of the chamber dark, so as to better accomplish ambushes in 8-4; the eastern ell of the chamber, where the gang sleeps and rests, is lit by torches and a tripod of heating (see new magic items). The western ell holds supplies – several barrels of smoked fish, a keg of ale, sacks of potatoes and leeks, a pail of black paint (for painting over graffiti in 8-3), etc. – and provides a narrow window onto the chasm spur (8-27). The walls of all three parts of the chamber are stained with smoke and debris, but a fresco on the north wall of the main chamber could be revealed with a bit of cleaning; it shows a pair of human-cat hybrids standing before an enormous black, seated cat. The seated cat is extending its paws to touch the heads of the ‘cat-women’. Underneath the image are the faded words in Mithric: “Lady Bastet bestows her gift on the faithful.” [GM: this is a hint as to the existence of maubaste at area 8-38]

The robbers have worked out a set of relationships to maximize their potential gains. Their junior (but glib) partner, Philippous, is ensconced in the traders’ area of Level 6 (6-28), 
where he sells objects stolen by the gang and communicates with Nicetas via his half of a pair of amulets of telepathy (see new magic items). Philippous often steers naive groups to Level 8 and then alerts Nicetas as to the potential pickings. Nicetas also has an arrangement with Ecath (8-1) whereby the gang surrenders 10% of its profits to Ecath in return for the varumani directing suitable prey their way.

The gang keeps its loot in the eastern ell, amid their bedrolls and cookpots. They have a 5’ marble statue of a dancing girl that they intend to sell in Newmarket, plus a locked chest whose key is held by Nicetas.

### 8-6: Closet and Teleporter Destination

The ancient Sortians constructed this secret closet under the noses of the imperial authorities in order to provide a link in their chain of teleport faces (see 6-48). The chamber is long and narrow, and is roughly delved without the usual finishing touches. A trio of hooks are set into the north wall; on one of them hangs a cloak of poisonousness, which Nicetas (8-5) hopes may thin the ranks of anyone appearing from this direction. 

Against the east wall is a Sortian face (see new magic items). It can be activated by inserting Sortian eyes (see new magic items) into the empty eye sockets. Only a few combinations of eyes are unique to an individual face; the rest are standard (and are detailed in the new magic items appendix).

Gold-Gold: Teleportation. All within 5’ are teleported to area 6-48

Gold-Sapphire: A permanent magic mouth speaks in Mithric from the face: No time for the usual maxims. Take notice! Zhorak the smith has departed suddenly. His workshop is apparently unguarded. Let the next member of the League to visit these halls go swiftly to the hall of apparition and employ the third rose circle along the northern side. Else it is a long walk of 265 cubits to the north. Make haste! The smith’s treasures will aid Macrinus in the Sortian cause.

GM Notes: The magic mouth refers to the forge of Zhorak (8-100), to the appropriate rose quartz circle in the Entrance Hall (8-7C), and to Macrinus, the most militaristic of the Sortian leaders (see World of Archontos appendix). This closet is also the destination for a Sortian face found at area 6-48. 

Secret Door (west): The secret door is easy to find (1 in 4). From the east side, it opens by raising a simple latch. 

### 8-7: Entrance Hall to the Nether Reaches

This substantial hall serves an important role as the jumping-off point for expeditions to most parts of the Nether Reaches. It provides direct – albeit highly dangerous – access to the Cave of the Bliss Flowers (8-67) via the Hall of Shadows (8-8). But it also provides one-way teleportal access to all of the key areas of the level via a set of specially built teleporters.

The hall is 30’ tall and brightly lit by continual light spells. The ceiling is supported by six pairs of 5’-diameter basalt columns, which form an avenue down the center of the room. To the north and south of the pillars are wide stone shelves that rise 5’ above the floor. Four 5’-diameter circles of rose quartz are inset into each shelf; these quartz circles are permanent teleporters providing direct, one-way access to various parts of the Nether Reaches. One activates a teleporter by standing or sitting within the rose quartz circle for one segment. Although the destinations of each circle are not officially indicated, in a few cases graffiti has been scratched into the rock next to the teleportal.

Teleporter Destination Graffiti (if any)

8-7a The Face of Bastet (8-30)

‘Cats!’ ‘That was a big mouse!’ (Archontean)

8-7B The Feasting Hall (area 8-77)

“Meat”, “Avoid the Wine” (Thorcin)

8-7C The Forge of Zhorak (8-102)

‘Music Room’ [incorrect]; 
‘Beware the [effaced]’ 
(Archontean)

8-7D The Temple of Besa (8-119)

‘To gold’ (Wiskin)

8-7E The Singing Grotto (8-146)

‘To Forge’ [incorrect]; 
‘Find Eustachius’s Book’ 
(Mithric)

8-7F The Crystalline Cave (8-169)

‘Hot and humid’, 
‘Bring suitable gear’ 
(Archontean)

8-7G Inoperable (or to an area of the GM’s creation)

8-7H Inoperable (or to an area of the GM’s creation)

### 8-8: Hall of Shadows

This dangerous hall is cloaked in darkness courtesy of several permanent darkness spells. The only break in the darkness comes from the torch held by the statue of Anubis that looms over the hall from the west. Anubis’s torch imparts a 20’-radius sphere of bright, yellow, true sunlight, and is an important protective device against the shadow creatures and other undead (see below).

The hall is 30’ tall. Its walls are covered with still-vivid ancient Archontean frescoes. The frescoes depict the following: laborers shaping stone (west wall), a field of bright flowers growing amid stones (north), sarcophagi, both open and closed (east), and varumani and heqeti, with the inscription (in Mithric) “our enemies” (south). Of course, these frescoes are invisible until the darkness is dispelled.

The hacked corpses of four kaliyani (see new monsters) lie on the stairs leading up to 8-7. An NPC adventuring party (see 7-75) slew the kaliyani and looted the bodies of all apparent 
valuables. That said, they did not know that the troll thegn (7-30) pays a bounty of 100 gp for every kaliyani fang; sixteen fangs are recoverable from the corpses.

Statue of Anubis: Anubis stands on a 10’-tall pedestal at the foot of the stairs descending from 8-7. His image is 9’ tall, and he is depicted in jackal-headed form, holding a traveler’s staff in his left hand and an upraised torch in his right. Yellow light streams from the torch. The statue is made of obsidian, with a few exceptions: Anubis’s eyes are star rubies (10,000 gp each), the staff is ebony, and the torch appears to be a formed of solid gold. The staff is 
theoretically removable, but only if rolls of 5d6 under STR and 4d6 under DEX are successfully made by a single person. The torch is removable (see below). Efforts to remove the eyes take 3-6 rounds and cause several negative effects: 2-12 HP electrical damage per 
round of prying, plus a curse. The gem thief loses one point of CON per day while a gem is not in its proper place, as does any person who even touches a stolen gem. The two effects are additive, so a thief that steals both gems suffers a loss of two points of CON per day. The curse can only be broken by returning a gem to its rightful place. Any person drained of all CON by a gem rises as a juju zombie which immediately returns the gem to its rightful 
location before wandering away to attack the closest living thing. Lost CON is regained at the rate of one point per week. 

Torch of Anubis: The torch appears to be solid gold and detects of magic and lawfulness (but not good or evil). In fact, it is fool’s gold (5 gp). It provides sunlight as well as a powerful magical protection against evil, preventing undead, demons, devils, and other evil extra-planar entities from entering its 20’ radius. Such creatures are thus effectively unable to cross into area 8-7; those standing on the stairs (and in the torch’s light) are also immune from attack by these creatures. The torch may be removed, albeit with serious consequences for any such thief. Removing the torch causes another identical torch to instantly appear in the hand of Anubis, so that the protective sunlight never disappears. The removed torch, however, equally instantly transforms into a cursed blacklight torch (see new magic items). Each time the torch of Anubis is removed, a new cursed blacklight torch is created.

A pack of greater shadows (see new monsters) under the control of Laocoon the shadow lord (8-15) inhabits the chamber. They are kept at bay by the sunlight emitted by the torch of Anubis, but move swiftly to attack those who step outside its light. Noise or combat in the chamber (such as combat against the shadows) will draw other minions of the shadow lord (see 8-15) on the following schedule after combat commences:

Round New arrival(s)

2 6 greater shadows (from 8-9 and 8-14)
3 4 vorantes demons (from 8-20; seenew monsters), and 3 skeletal wights (from 8-16)
4 Laocoon the Shadow Lord, plus 3 greater shadows (from 8-15)
5 4 vorantes demons (see new monsters) and a greater vorantes demon (from 8-21) 

8 greater shadows (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 5+1; HP 41, 39, 37, 36, 36, 35, 33, 31; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: ability drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold, poison, paralysis, sleep, charm, and hold; turned as a wraith.

Treasure:
Staff of Anubis (see new magic items); sixteen kaliyani fangs (100 gp each to the troll thegn, 7-30); cursed blacklight torch (see new magic items)

 
### 8-9: Shadows

This former administrative chamber is crammed with debris and broken furniture. Movement is difficult before the ruined desks, chairs, racks, etc. are cleared out. For every turn searching the rubble, there is a 10% cumulative chance of finding a small item of value (each item may be found once):

D6 Item of value
1 A pouch with 23 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items)
2 A scroll with the 7th-level magic user spell, limited wish
3 A feline ushabti figurine, made of solid silver (125 gp)
4 Two unbreakable bolts +2
5 A gold and platinum torc, inscribed with the name ‘Paratus the Logothete’ (775 gp) [see also SL12-23]
6 Key to secret door leading to 8-12

Three greater shadows inhabit the chamber, but they are likely to be encountered in area 8-8 first (see chart at that location). Secret Door (west): The door is normal to find. It opens by sliding a panel of stone to the right.

Secret Door (east): The door is normal to find and opens either by a key (found by searching the debris) or by force. 

3 greater shadows (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 5+1; HP 36, 34, 30; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: ability drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to 
hit; immune to cold, poison, paralysis, sleep, charm, and hold; turned as a wraith.

### 8-10: Secret Closet

The corpse of a human adventurer is slumped on the floor, next to the dead body of a vorantes demon (see new monsters). The adventurer’s legs are broken, but she still wears leather armor +2 and an ankh of protection (see new magic items) on a copper chain around her neck. Her light crossbow of speed lies by her body; its string is broken, and can only be replaced with spider silk from a giant spider or with hair from the mane of a unicorn. 

The adventurer wrote a short note on the wall before she died of blood loss; it reads “The shadows seem to be controlled by some evil intelligence, but we could not locate it. We pushed south but encountered the strange rollers. Then more shadows ... everywhere! Kallion ran to the east, but Jadon and the bearers fled north towards the light. I was overcome but managed to crawl to this closet. Perhaps I can make it to the light.” GM Notes: the body of Kallion is in 8-15, while that of Jadon is in 8-67; the ‘evil intelligence’ is Laocoon (8-15); the rollers are vorantes demons (areas 8-18 to 8-21); the light could refer to Anubis’s torch (8-7) or the Cave of Flowers (8-67). 

Treasure:
Leather armor +2; damaged light crossbow of speed; ankh of protection (see new magic items). 

### 8-11: The Landing of Flowers

Forty feet of stairs rise from the darkness of 8-8 towards a bright, well-lit landing. The walls of the stairwell are carved intricately in the form of flowers, vines, and creepers. The landing extends 15’ into an enormous cavern (8-67); it is 60’ above the cavern floor, and 30’ below the ceiling.

The magically created sunlight in 8-67 prevents the shadows from area 8-8 and other undead from neighboring areas from entering the landing.

### 8-12: Secret Room

A decrepit wooden table stands against the north wall, while two wall-mounted racks on the south wall have collapsed in a pile of rotted wood. A dozen potions sit on the table, the products of an ancient but forgotten Archontean alchemist. Amid the debris of the fallen racks is the beekeeper’s rod (see new magic items).

Secret Doors (east and west): The doors are easy (1 in 3) to find from this side. They open with the key (found in 8-9) or by force.

Treasure:
Beekeeper’s rod (see new magic items); potions of healing x3; potions of plant control x4; and potions of sweetwater, speed, heroism, invulnerability, and levitation.

### 8-13: Table with Corpses

A large oak table, 10’x20’ in size, occupies the center of this chamber. The desiccated corpses of two human men-at-arms lie under the table; their souls have joined the troupe of shadows that killed them. The corpses carry leather armor, long swords, and pouches with 77 and 43 sp respectively.

Secret Door (west): The door is normal to find. It opens either by force, or with a key that fits the cleverly-hidden lock (the key may be found in 8-9).

### 8-14: More Shadows

A series of stone busts built into the walls line the walls of this chamber. There are sixteen busts, each about 3’ tall; each depicts a now-forgotten Archontean functionary. They are carved in high realism, showing wrinkles, warts, and scars. Tucked into the space between one bust and the wall is a scroll of protection from undead, a scroll of protection from acid, and a scroll of protection from devils.

Three more greater shadows (see new monsters) occupy the chamber, although they are likely to be first encountered in area 8-8 (q.v.).

3 greater shadows (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 5+1; HP 36, 34, 30; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: ability drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold, poison, paralysis, sleep, charm, and hold; turned as a wraith.

Treasure: 
A scroll of protection from undead; scroll of protection from acid; scroll of protection from devils.

### 8-15: Lair of Laocoon the Shadow Lord

Four thick (5’-diameter) columns support the ceiling of this oddly shaped hall. A huge oak throne sits against the south wall. The columns were painted cerulean blue in antiquity, and still bear splashes of color. A patch of living mosaic (see new magic items) is set in the east wall at eye level; it shows the landing of flowers (8-11) and part of the cave of flowers (8-67), and is filled with movement due to the bees that are active in 8-67. 

A vile shadow lord (see new monsters) named Laocoon has taken this hall for his lair. Laocoon dominates the shadows that occupy the chambers around 8-8, and even is able to bend the vorantes (see new monsters) to his will (see 8-18 to 8-21). He typically sits in the throne, nearly invisible in the darkness, where his shadow minions whisper placatingly in his ears. Of course, Laocoon may also be encountered in 8-8 (q.v.). His treasure is piled against the wall next to the throne. 

The body of a notorious adventurer, Kallion the White, lies amid the columns. Although the remains still bear his white-painted banded mail, Kallion’s soul has joined the troupe of 
shadows that killed him. For more on Kallion, see 4-24, 4-58, and 8-10.

Laocoon the shadow lord (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 4; MV 150’, 240’ flying (Class A); HD 9+3; HP 65; #AT 2; Dmg 2-5/2-5. Special attacks: evil aura, 20’ radius (regenerate 1 HP/rd, reduce turning by 2, drains STR of living); command lesser undead. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold, poison, paralysis, sleep, charm and hold; turned as vampires. Spell use: augury, cause critical wounds, detect magic, dispel magic, locate object, stone tell, symbol of pain.

3 greater shadows (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 5+1; HP 36, 35, 30; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: ability drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to 
hit; immune to cold, poison, paralysis, sleep, charm, and hold; turned as a wraith.

Treasure:
On Kallion’s body: white banded mail +2; the intelligent long sword Narses (see new magic items); a pair of silver armbands chased with gold (500 gp each); a gold ring with a ruby (1,500 gp); a purse with 275 sp and 439 gp; and the key to his lockbox in 4-24 (q.v.).

Laocoon’s treasure: 4,199 gp; 3 pieces of chalcedony (50 gp each); 3 amethysts (100 gp each); and 3 black pearls (500 gp each).

## Level 8: 16 - 30

### 8-16: Sparring Hall

The walls of this former sparring hall are lined with metal clips and wooden racks designed to hold all manner of weapons. Only a few weapons remain, and all are mundane: 2 halberds, 2 bill-guisarmes, a footman’s flail, and a mace. In the center of the chamber is a sand-filled pit; the pit is 10’x20’ and 5’ deep. The sand is tightly packed, such that its level is now 2” below the stone of the main floor. Buried in the sand are two skeletons, one wearing a corroded but still usable suit of imperial field plate (see Arden Vul items) while the other possesses a philter of beauty and clutches a dagger of venom. It takes 5-8 turns of digging to find these items.

Three skeletal wights (see new monsters) occupy this hall, although they are likely to be encountered in 8-8 (q.v.).

3 skeletal wights (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 5+1; HP 35, 33, 32; #AT 1; Dmg 3-9. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: successful energy drain heals 3-9 HP; +1 or better weapons to hit; edged weapons do ½ damage; immune to sleep, charm, hold, poison, paralyzation and cold; turned as ghasts. 

Treasure:
A suit of imperial field plate (see Arden Vul items); philter of beauty; dagger of venom.

### 8-17: Chamber of Several Uses

This utilitarian chamber is largely undecorated, although flecks of sky-blue paint remain on the wall. To the south is a well, 4’ in diameter and rising 4’ from the floor. It sinks 60’ to a large waterfilled cavern. The rusted winch mechanism for the well is, however, broken.

 To the north is a set of 2”-tall paving stones arranged in a 6’-diameter ring. Inset into the floor next to the ring is a rectangle 48” long by 8” tall; the rectangle is divided into six interior compartments, each 8” square. Together these elements form a Thothian teleportation ring (see new magic items). To activate the ring, one must place six colored glass activation squares into the inset according to a sequence that matches the ‘address’ of the ring to which one wishes to travel. Once the squares are placed, a brief shimmer of energy is visible over the ring. At this point the user has 1 round to collect the squares and enter the ring, after which anyone in the ring is teleported without error to address indicated by that sequence of squares. If the glass activation squares are not collected and/or if the travelers do not possess a second set of them, they are likely to be stranded in the location to which they have just teleported. The address of this ring is as follows: RE-BK-BL-GR-YE-WH (see new magic items for explanation). None of the glass activation squares necessary to operate the circle are present.

### 8-18: Audience Hall

A 2’-tall, semi-circular dais made of blue granite abuts the east wall. On top of the dais is a large stone throne of the same blue stone. The rest of the chamber is strangely bare of decorations.  Four vorantes demons (see new monsters) roll about in this chamber, looking for prey. The vorantes demons are quick to join combat in 8-8 (q.v.)

A hidden compartment (detected as a secret door) in the throne contains a piece of folded oilskin cloth, tied up with string and sealed with red wax (the seal is a hoplite helmet with the words ‘Valens proedros’ around it). Inside the cloth are Valens’s tokens of office, a gold signet ring (550 gp), a platinum scepter (1,250 gp), and a set of silver writing tools (125 gp).

4 vorantes demons (see new monsters): SZ S; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 28, 26, 24, 21; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8; MR 10%. Special attacks: gnaw. Special defenses: take 1 less HP damage 
per die versus fire and cold. Special: demonic telepathy; can see in absolute darkness.

Treasure:
A gold signet ring (550 gp), a platinum scepter (1,250 gp), and a set of silver writing tools (125 gp).

### 8-19: Decayed Lounge

Formerly a sumptuous-appointed lounge, this chamber is now largely filled with debris. A beautiful silk rug (10’x20’) depicting various legendary monsters (dragons, sea serpents, kraken, etc.) occupies the center of the chamber (575 gp, but heavy). The rotted remnants of a half dozen leather chairs have been pushed against the walls, amid other bits of wood, leather, and cloth. Three bronze side tables (75 gp each) are buried among the debris. A tall, heavy, but empty bookcase stands in front of a 2’-diameter hole located near the ceiling of the southwest corner.

Four vorantes demons and a greater vorantes demon (see new monsters) occupy the chamber.

The tunnel to the south is only 2’ in diameter where it enters this chamber; it gradually grows larger in diameter as it descends to the south. The vorantes demons are unaware of the hole, and the kaliyani (8-22) deemed it a tactically dangerous dead end.

4 vorantes demons (see new monsters): SZ S; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 28, 26, 24, 21; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8; MR 10%. Special attacks: gnaw. Special defenses: take 1 less HP damage 
per die versus fire and cold. Special: demonic telepathy; can see in absolute darkness.

1 greater vorantes demon (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 7+3; HP 47; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: gnaw. Special defenses: immune to fire and cold. Special: demonic telepathy; can see in absolute darkness.

### 8-20: Former Barracks

The remains of four wooden bunkbeds rest against the north wall of this chamber. The four vorantes demons (see new monsters) that occupy the chamber are busily devouring the (somewhat rancid) corpses of two human adventurers.

4 vorantes demons (see new monsters): SZ S; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 28, 26, 24, 21; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8; MR 10%. Special attacks: gnaw. Special defenses: take 1 less HP damage 
per die versus fire and cold. Special: demonic telepathy; can see in absolute darkness.

Treasure:
One of the corpses still bears a scroll with the cleric spells stone tell and heal. The other bears a morning star +1 and a 4”-tall, golden votive statuette of Besa, the Archontean goddess of pleasure (610 gp). A torn and tattered (but still legible) copy of the Twelve Labors of Arden lies under one of the bunkbeds (see Arden Vul Books).

### 8-21: Bedroom

Unlike neighboring rooms, this chamber features plastered walls, on top of which are bright frescoes showing an Archontean official (Valens the proedros) dispensing justice, commanding laborers, and reclining in a throne-like chair (that looks much like the one 
in 8-18). The plaster on the west wall conceals the broken passage that originally led to area 8-25. The corridor fragment is instantly recognizable as from a different era of construction; its walls are pebbled and oily, and throw off a very dim sense of evil (a product of its heqeti origins).

The main chamber is marked by the remains of a once grand four-poster bed, now collapsed in the southwest corner. A teak writing desk (175 gp) on the north wall is intact; the desk is carved with exotic, non-Archontean figures (it comes from the Khumus people to the west). 

Four vorantes demons and a greater vorantes demon (see new monsters) occupy this chamber, although they may be first encountered in 8-8 (q.v.).

4 vorantes demons (see new monsters): SZ S; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 28, 26, 24, 21; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8; MR 10%. Special attacks: gnaw. Special defenses: take 1 less HP damage per die versus fire and cold. Special: demonic telepathy; can see in absolute darkness.

1 greater vorantes demon (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 7+3; HP 44; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: gnaw. Special defenses: immune to fire and cold. Special: demonic telepathy; can see in absolute darkness.

Treasure:
The writing desk holds a jade ink well (225 gp), a crystal-encrusted golden statuette of a large-bellied, smiling woman (375 gp), and, stuck to the underside of the single drawer, a parchment bifolium entitled ‘The Honey Project’ (see Arden Vul books).

### 8-22: Crossroads Cave

This large, 25’-tall cave sits at the nexus of several tunnels linking various levels of Arden Vul. Numerous stalactites and stalagmites dot the cavern. A ranger will have little difficulty in noticing the signs of recent traffic between 8-23 and 8-24; the tracks suggest a six-legged creature. 

To the west of the cavern is a ledge rising some 20’ above the floor. Hidden behind a rock fall is the tunnel to 8-25. The tunnel mouth should be considered as a concealed door. 

A second ledge, some 15’ above the floor, occupies the niche on the north wall. Three kaliyani scouts wait on the ledge. They serve as guardians for the expedition that rose from 9-57 to 8-23, crossed the chasm between 8-24 and 7-34, and then ascended to 5-125. 

The scouts have drunk potions of invisibility and will exercise caution when confronting any intruders. Indeed, if they are obviously outmatched, one of the scouts slips down the tunnel at 8-23 to warn the kaliyani at 9-57, a second attempts to slip past the PCs and swarm up the ropes at 8-24 to alert its fellows at 5-125, and the third waits quietly, observing and taking careful notes of intruders strengths and capabilities. If intruders appear weak or foolish, however, the scouts attack from their perch.

Concealed Door (west): The tunnel to the west is concealed behind a rock fall. The tunnel can be detected normally; it takes 2-4 turns to clear the opening.

3 invisible, 5th-level kaliyani scouts (see new monsters), as 5th-level thieves: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 150’ on six legs, 60’ upright; HD 6; HP 43, 41, 38, 36; #AT 2; Dmg 3-8/3-8 (scimitars) 
or 2-7/2-7 (javelins). Special defenses: immune to poison and mind-affecting spells. Special: infravision; DEX 16. Thief skills: PP 50%, OL 47%, F/RT 40%, MS 40%, HS 31%, HN 20%, CW 
90%, RL 25%. Possessions: twin serrated scimitars; six javelins; a set of silver rings, worked glass and minor gemstones, and repurposed coins worth 200 gp. One has a vial of poison; another has a minor heqeti slime (see new monsters) in a breakable flask; and one has a solid gold ouroboros bracelet (175 gp). All three have already drunk potions of invisibility.

1 pale lavender, quicksilver-like heqeti slime (see new mon-sters), in a flask held by one of the kaliyani scouts: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 5’ creeping; HD 2; HP 13; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6; MR 15%. Special attacks: flesh-eating for 4-7 rounds; corrosive to metal, leather, and wood. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.

### 8-23: Tunnel Down to 9-57

A narrow tunnel twists downward here before opening onto the floor of the Great Chasm (9-57). A ranger or other tracker will easily notice the signs of the passage of several six-legged creatures (kaliyani).

### 8-24: Chasm Access and Route to 7-34 

A wide ledge provides access to the Great Chasm here. Three ropes studded with loops and knots are set into the chasm wall next to the ledge; the ropes lead upward steeply to area 7-34. The kaliyani exploring party now at 5-125 installed the ropes after they made their way from 9-57 to 8-23.

### 8-25: Heqeti Transport Hall, with Stairs Up to 6-106

The heqeti (see new monsters) built this hall as a connection site between their (now-destroyed) halls on Level 8 and their shrine on Level 6 (i.e., 6-104, 6-106). With the resurgence of the heqeti, and their re-occupation of the shrine at 6-104, this hall has also been partially restored. The walls have been coated with fresh slime, the passage to the pukel-mander (8-26) was re-opened, and an effort has been made to bring the teleport wells back into operation.  A statue of a heqeti warrior thrusting with a spear stands by the west wall, partly concealing the secret door to 8-26. The statue is old and very worn, and carved out of the local granite. Its eyes are empty sockets; should a gem of 500 gp (or greater) value be placed in either socket, the statue will partially animate, piping out a query in heqeti. Those who understand that language have an opportunity to ask three questions of the statue, which responds truthfully to the best of its knowledge (which, sadly, is thousands 
of years out of date).

The niches to the north contain heqeti teleport wells. Each well takes the form of a 7’-diameter circle of stone rising 3’ above the floor. Both wells appear to contain nothing but inky blackness; objects tossed into either make no sound. Neither well is operative at the moment, however, a fact that is currently proving vexing to the heqeti. Those jumping into either well are instantly vaporized.  Currently a small party of heqeti are stationed here, puzzling over their failure to get the teleport wells to operate correctly. One of their number is stationed at the mouth of the tunnel to 8-22; the vigilance of this guard makes it unlikely that the heqeti will be surprised from this direction.

The stairs climb steeply in a tight spiral to 6-106.
 
A natural tunnel to 8-22 departs from the western corridor, but it is concealed behind the rockfall that blocks the corridor.Secret Doors (west): The 4’-wide door is normal to find. It hangs on a horizontal pin; one needs merely push on the upper or lower panel to swing the door open. Within the tunnel leading to 8-26 is a second secret door, which is clearly visible from this side; the second secret door opens only by force or to a simple pulling motion by those of chaotic evil alignment.

1 heqeti weaver (see new monsters), as a 7th/7th-level magic user/cleric of Kauket: SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’, 90’ swimming; HD 7; HP 34; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10 (footman’s mace +2). Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice. Possessions: amulet of natural armor +2 (see new magic items); staff of healing (12 charges); copper-headed footman’s mace +2; two glass spheres of arcane assistance (one of arcane warding, one of protection) (see new magic items); potion of gaseous form. Magic user spells: enlarge, jump, magic missile, shield; continual light, levitate, ray of enfeeblement; fireball, protection from normal missiles; polymorph other. Cleric spells: bless, 
command (x2), create water, cure light wounds; chant, hold person (x2), resist fire, silence 15’ radius; animate dead, blindness; sticks to snakes.

6 heqeti hoppers (see new monsters), as 5th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 5; HP 35, 34, 33, 30, 29; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

### 8-26: Pukel-mander

One of the loathsome heqeti pukel-manders (see new magic items) crouches here, on a ledge overlooking the Great Chasm. Over a dozen chasm cephalopod husks dot the floor at the thing’s feet.Secret Doors (northeast): The door is normal to locate, but opens only to those who are chaotic evil in alignment (for whom it pushes aside easily) or by force. A second, 4’-wide, secret door lies at the end of the tunnel leading to 8-25. This door is easy to locate; as it hangs on a horizontal pin, it opens by pushing on either the upper or lower half of the door. 

### 8-27: Spur of the Great Chasm

About 500 years ago, erosion along the wall of the Great Chasm began to produce this side spur. Indeed, it continues to slowly encroach on the worked areas to the east. The spur is about 100’ tall; Level 8 bisects it at about its midpoint (i.e., 50’ above the floor of the spur). Bits of rope attached to spikes hammered into both landings hang into the spur. At the bottom of the chasm are several chasm cephalopod husks as well as a smashed and inoperable basic exploration automaton from Kerbog Khan’s workshop (see new monsters). Those investigating the floor of the spur provoke two additional chances for random encounters (see 8-2 for possible encounters).

Treasure:
The remains of the automaton could be delivered to Kerbog Khan (SL12-16) in return for favors. Among the debris are three chrysoprase gems (50 gp each) that the automaton had located. 

### 8-28: Northern Landing

The northern side of the chasm spur is nondescript save for eight spikes hammered into the lip of the chasm. Numerous lengths of rope hang from the spikes.

### 8-29: Transitional Hall

This empty chamber displays a marked variation in construction. The eastern, western and southern walls are typical of Archontean construction: neatly trimmed granite. The northern third of the floor and the north wall, however, are of rudishva vintage: octagonal plaques of solid white marble closely fit together, and with rounded joints between floor and walls. In the center of the northern wall is a rudishva iris door that spirals open only when a sky blue or better plastic rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items) is presented. 

Secret Door (east): This door is difficult to locate (1 in 8). It opens by inserting a 1”-diameter object into a small hole in the ceiling; the hole is perfectly sized for a sun lance of a sun-scarred knight (see new monsters).

### 8-30: Face of Bastet

An enormous alabaster screen carved in the form of an open cat’s mouth serves as a sign that one is approaching the domain of Bastet. The screen is thick (5’) and tall (15’), and is carved to show a cat with alert ears, open eyes, bared fangs, and a slightly extended tongue. The face is coated with fresh paint: the ‘fur’ is black, the eyes are yellow, the teeth are white, and the tongue is pink. One traverses the screen by climbing up a slight incline on the cat’s tongue and then entering the corridor to the north. 

There are always 2-5 cats of various shapes and sizes climbing on and around the face of Bastet. One of these felines will always be a large golden-furred tabby that purrs loudly and near-constantly; it is, in fact, a luck eater. The priestesses know of the luck eater and tolerate its presence here as a sign of Bastet’s mysterious ways.

Although it detects of magic, the stone screen is inert except in two circumstances. First, if Oubaste, the high priestess of Bastet (8-37), is slain, then the cat’s fangs will slam down on the person who delivered the killing blow when next that person traverses the mouth, inflicting 6-36 HP damage. The mouth remains shut, blocking traffic between 8-28 and 8-38. Only when a new high priestess is installed will the mouth open again. Second, the passage of any creature who is not primarily chaotic in alignment (i.e., all save those of alignments CE, CN and CG) through the mouth causes a loud caterwauling sound to echo throughout the region. This sound serves to alert the priestesses of the arrival of potential trouble.

Set into the floor of the niche to the west of the screen is a 5’-diameter circle of rose quartz; this is the destination for the teleporter at 8-7A.

1 luck eater: SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 150’; HD 4; HP 26; #AT 0; Dmg 0. Special attacks: surprise 1-4 in 6; purr effects 30’ radius (effect varies).

1-4 wild cats (from 3-181): SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 180’; HD 1; HP 5, 3, 3, 2; #AT 3; Dmg 1-2/1-2/1-2. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6

## Level 8: 31 - 45

### 8-31: Acolytes of Bastet

Twelve acolytes of Bastet occupy this unusual chamber. 

A 10’-diameter disk of pure silver is attached to the center of the ceiling (500 gp). The chamber is flooded with pure moonlight thanks to the nighteyes of Bastet (see new spells) spell that has been cast on the silver disk.

Twelve piles of soft linen and wool abut the walls of the chamber. In the center is a 10’x10’ pool of cool, clean water. On the west wall is a huge fresco of a black cat’s head. Studding the north, south and east walls are a score of wooden posts set horizontally into the stone; these allow the acolytes’ semi-tame pet cats (as well as small maubaste) to jump about and climb. Each acolyte’s ‘nest’ contains 3-60 gp and 1-3 fancy gems (100 gp each). 

A ledge above the door is empty, but bears a note that reads, in Mithric, “Rex, faithful guardian and friend to cats.” It refers to Rex, the whippet companion of Gennadius (see 3-158 and 8-41). The mummified body of Rex rested on this ledge for several centuries until it was stolen and traded to Reith (6-50). The acolytes would be grateful to anyone who returns their mascot.

If the temple has not been alerted to the presence of interlopers, then six of the acolytes are present here, lounging about and bathing; the other six are present in 8-38. If the temple has been alerted to a threat, then all twelve acolytes are present in 8-38.

Acolytes are human females and 4th- or 5th-level clerics. Each wears a silver moon of Bastet (see new magic items) on a silver chain around her neck; these items allow acolytes to transform into small maubaste (see new monsters).

6 acolytes, 4th-level female Thorcin clerics of Bastet. In human form: SZ M; AL CN; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 30, 30, 28, 28, 26, 25; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (jo-stick). Abilities: STR 11, INT 9, 
WIS 15, DEX 16, CON 11, CHA 16. Possessions: a black silk robe; an earring of protection +1 (see new magic items); a moon of Bastet (see new magic items); and a polished black jo-stick. Prepared spells: command, cure light wounds, fear, protection from evil, sanctuary; hold person, silence 15’ radius, speak with animals. In maubaste form: SZ S; AL CN; AC 3; MV 150’; HD 4; HP as above; #AT 3 or 5; Dmg 1-3/1-3/2-7, plus 1-3/1-3; MR 20%.

Prepared spells: command, cure light wounds, fear, protection from evil, sanctuary; augury, chant, hold person, silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic or create food and water (3 have the former, 3 the latter). In maubaste form: SZ S; AL CN; AC 3; MV 150’; HD 5; HP as above; #AT 3 or 5; Dmg 1-3/1-3/2-7, plus 1-3/1-3; MR 20%.

7 semi-tame domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2; #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

Treasure:
12 ‘nests’, each with 3-60 gp and 1-3 fancy gems (100 gp each)

### 8-32: Priestesses of Bastet

Four priestesses of Bastet dwell in this chamber. Should the temple be alerted to a threat, the chamber is empty; all four priestesses will be found in 8-38. If the temple has not been alerted, two priestesses may be found here. Typically the priestesses are found in human form in their chamber; each is an attractive, black-haired woman. The priestesses swiftly transform into medium maubaste if the circumstances require (see new monsters).

A 10’-diameter disk of pure silver (500 gp) is attached to the center of the ceiling. On it has been cast nighteyes of Bastet (see new spells); this spell causes the entire chamber to be flooded with pure moonlight.

Two bunkbeds occupy the east wall; the beds are appointed with black silk sheets (four sets of sheets, 20 gp each). A half-dozen goats hang from hooks along the north wall. A wooden table with five chairs sits in the center of the chamber, while a large wine rack with 30 bottles of valuable red wine (25-125 gp per bottle) sits against the south wall. A wardrobe by the door holds 20 black silk robes, each with a silver halfmoon on the chest and a silver cat’s head on the back (25 gp each). A treasure chest sits between the two bunkbeds; it is locked, and each priestess holds a key.

Atet, Hent, Ipwet, and Kiya, each a priestess of Bastet and a 7th-level female Archontean cleric of Bastet. In human form: SZ M; AL CN; AC 6; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 53, 52, 49, 47; #AT 1; 
Dmg 2-7 (jo-stick +1). Abilities: STR 11, INT 9, WIS 16, DEX 16, CON 11, CHA 16. Possessions: a black silk robe; an earring of protection +2 (see new magic items); a moon of Bastet (see 
new magic items); and a polished black jo-stick +1. Prepared spells: command, cure light wounds, fear, protection from evil, sanctuary; augury, chant, hold person, silence 15’ radius, speak with animals; dispel magic, prayer; cure serious wounds. In medium maubaste form: SZ M; AL CN; AC 4; MV 150’; HD 7; HP as above; #AT 3 or 5; Dmg 1-4/1-4/2-9, plus 1-4/1-4; MR 30%.

Treasure:
4 sets of black silk sheets (20 gp each); 30 bottles of red wine (25-125 gp per bottle); 20 black silk robes (25 gp each).In the treasure chest: 4,352 ancient silver pennies and 2,411 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items for coins); 25 carnelians (50 gp), 10 pieces of coral (100 gp each), 5 tourmalines (100 gp), 4 aquamarines (500 gp), and 1 jacinth (1,000 gp).

### 8-33: Storage Chamber, with Hole up to 6-20

The cult of Bastet stores its foodstuffs and other equipment in this plain chamber. Among the goods are three barrels of dried biscuits, a box of dried meat, two boxes of dried fruit, a large sack of salt, and a sack with twelve balls made of red rubber, each 2” in diameter. In addition, the corpses of several animals are curing on hooks set into the ceiling: these include a dozen rats threaded onto three strings, a small boar, two dogs, a wolverine, and a goat. The corpse of a halfling hangs curing as well.

A hole in the ceiling leads up 400’ via several ledges and landings to area 6-20. There are no handholds or footholds between the ledges and landings. Climbing up or down the entire length requires five successful climb walls checks. Oubaste (8-37) knows of the hole and of the occasional visits of Thegan White-Mane (6-19); she tolerates his coming and going so long as he brings the occasional bag, box, or barrel of supplies.

Secret Door (south): The door is difficult to locate (1 in 8). It takes the form of a 6’-wide, 3’-tall sliding panel of stone near the ceiling of the chamber. Once found it is easy to open by sliding the panel to the east.

### 8-34: Secret Staircase up to 3-41a

A very steep staircase climbs many hundreds of feet via numerous switchbacks before reaching the tomb of Menas the Logothete (3-41A); its upper reaches are coated with thin layer of fine sand. A pair of stone marbles rest on the penultimate stair from the bottom; their origin is a mystery. If 3-41A has never been accessed before, then opening the doors from this side causes an avalanche of sand to pour out from 3-41A and down the staircase. The force of the sand trap is likely to knock unwitting PCs down the stairs, causing 8-48 damage (half if a save versus petrification is made). At that point, the upper 40’ of the staircase will be buried under sand, and area 3-41A will only be accessible after substantial digging.

Secret Door (north): The secret door on the north wall is easy to locate from this side (1 in 4). It opens by sliding a panel to the east.

### 8-35: Rudishva Hall, with Stairs Up to 5-63

This chamber is obviously of rudishva construction, with its sheathing of octagonal white plates of marble and lack of 90-degree angles. It is dominated by the stairs which rise some 1,000’ through many landings and turns to Level 5 (area 5-63). Some garish graffiti, in huge, red-painted letters, mars the west wall: it reads (in Archontean) ‘to the Knights,’ with an arrow pointing north. A second, smaller hand has annotated the earlier graffiti in the same 
tongue with the word ‘vampires.’. Both doors are rudishva iris doors, and may only be opened when a sky blue or better plastic rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items) is presented. GM Note: The graffiti refers to the fact that the main route to the 
Sun-Scarred Knights (Sub-Level 10A) may be found by heading north from this chamber

### 8-36: Mummification Chamber

A strong smell of cinnamon and juniper greets anyone who listens at this door.

The chamber is devoted to mummifying deceased members of the cult of Bastet. Two large stone tables stand in the center of the room; one has a human female in process of mummification, the other has two ordinary cats in early stages of mummification. Frescoes in bright paint line the walls: these show the process of mummification, from corpse to beautifully arranged mummy. Some of the subjects are human women, others are cats. 

The east wall is lined with alabaster jars containing the materials used in the process: wax, juniper berries, scented unguents and oils, salt, and sawdust. A large box on the north wall 
contains linen strips. Scattered around the tables are a half-dozen copper knives, hooks, and other implements.

### 8-37: Chamber of Oubaste, the High Priestess of Bastet

Oubaste, the high priestess of Bastet, resides here. The ceiling is 20’ tall, and three enormous alabaster bas-reliefs of cat faces occupy the west, north and east walls. The alabaster tongues of these cats are extended into the center of the room, where they connect to an elevated platform (10’ above the floor). 

Above the interlocked tongues and attached to the ceiling is another 10’-diameter disk of pure silver (500 gp). The cult has cast nighteyes of Bastet (see new spells) on the disk, causing it to flood the chamber with pure moonlight.

Oubaste’s bed is located on the raised platform; it is comprised of numerous cushions and black silk sheets (20 gp). A silk rope ladder is coiled atop the platform. Her personal treasure is located in a locked iron box set inside the open mouth of the bas-relief on the west wall. In human form she appears as a beautiful woman with brown eyes, brown skin and waist-length, raven black hair. Oubaste shares her chamber and bed with her second-in-command, Juliana, a human magic user.

An ebony writing desk (450 gp) stands against the north wall (below the tongue). 

There is only a 15% chance that Oubaste and Juliana are present; otherwise they are found in 8-38. Juliana is besotted with Oubaste, and has been begging her to grant her the right to 
transform into a maubaste; Oubaste has not yet agreed, preferring to observe and gauge Juliana’s devotion to Bastet for a while.

Oubaste, high priestess, and 9th-level female Archontean cleric of Bastet. In human form: SZ M; AL CN; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 9; HP 62; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (sistrum of Bastet). Abilities: STR

### 8-38: Outer Temple of Bastet

This enormous, 25’-tall chamber serves as the entranceway to the shrine proper. Four 10’-diameter silver disks (500 gp each) hang from the ceiling; with nighteyes of Bastet (see new spells) cast on them, they flood the area with pure moonlight. A landing runs across the east end. Stairs lead down into a pool of placid water, from which half-columns rise in two rows to a height 10’ above the water. At the west end is the enormous alabaster inner temple (8-
39), fronted by another landing and steps into the pool. A narrow, 6”-wide ledge runs along the north and south walls at a level 15’ above the floor. Also on the north and south walls, above the water line, are four 15’-tall niches, each holding a 12’-tall basalt statue of Bastet in cat-headed human form. Each statue wears a gold earring set with a sapphire (1,000 gp each). The statues themselves could be sold for 5,000 gp each to an appropriate statue merchant.

The half-pillars are 5’ in diameter and rise 10’ above the water. In maubaste form, the priestesses can leap easily from pillar to pillar, and will use this tactic if combat breaks out in the temple. 

The tunnels leading to 8-42 and 8-50 are narrow (4’ diameter) and placed 15’ above the water line.

High Priestess Oubaste (8-37) has cast hallow (see new spells) in the outer temple; this effect means that the area is sanctified for those of chaotic neutral alignment (+2 to all rolls for those of alignment CN; -2 to all rolls for all others).

The eastern wall of the inner temple (8-39) offers a commanding sight to those in outer temple. The wall is 25’ tall and made of alabaster; eighteen niches (each 3’ tall and 2’ wide) are carved into the facade. The niches are arranged such that there are nine niches on each side of the entrance to 8-39, in three tiers (at 5’, 11’, and 17’ above the floor). All but one of the niches contain a 3’-tall statuette of a cat in various poses: crouching, batting with a paw, hissing, sleeping, curled with a kitten, etc. Sixteen of the statuettes are painted alabaster, but two are different. The niche on the lowest register to the left of the opening to 8-39 is empty, while its counterpart to the right of the entrance contains a solid gold statuette of Bastet (see new magic items). The empty niche used to contain a second golden statuette of Bastet, but it was stolen years ago and may currently be found in area 3-215. Returning the missing statuette wins the friendship of the priesthood. 

The middle statuette in the right upper register is also significant. It is of a classically posed cat, sitting on its haunches. Unlike all the others, it is partly attached to the floor via a spring 
mechanism. Pulling it forward serves to unlock and open the secret doors on the west wall of 8-39 (leading to 8-40).

In addition to the priesthood, the temple is regularly visited by two dozen feral cats who use the tunnels to 8-42 and 8-50 to come and go from their lairs.

If the temple is entered by surprise, or by those allied with the cult of Bastet, PCs will find half the acolytes and priestesses (see 8-31 and 8-32) lounging about, swimming, talking, and performing rituals in the inner temple. On such occasions, Oubaste and Juliana (8-37) are also present 85% of the time.

If the temple has been alerted, or the cult has reason to believe that enemies are near, then all the members of the cult (twelve acolytes, four priestesses, Oubaste and Juliana) will be present. In such cases, eight of the acolytes will be standing in human form on the half-pillars, while the four priestesses crouch next to the basalt statues of Bastet in the north and south niches; the remaining four acolytes, plus Oubaste and Juliana, stand before the entrance to 8-39. If combat ensues, the acolytes are quick to transform into maubaste and attempt to knock foes into the water. The priestesses open with spells before changing into maubaste form and leaping across the pillars to confront foes. Oubaste and Juliana maintain 
spell use for as long as necessary before Oubaste also transforms into a maubaste.

Oubaste, the high priestess (85%): see stats at 8-37

Juliana (85%): see stats at 8-37

2 (50%) or 4 (50%) of the priestesses: see stats at 8-32.

6 (50%) or 12 (50%) of the acolytes; see stats at 8-31. 

12 domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5(x3), 4(x3), 3(x3), 2(x3); #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

### 8-39: Inner Temple

The inner temple takes the form of an enclosed cella some 30’ square. Its walls, floor and ceiling are enormous slabs of alabaster. The external facade of the east wall of the cella is set with niches (see description at 8-38). The dominant feature of the cella is the colossal statue of Bastet that stands against the west wall. Six iron torch brackets set into the floor provide a dramatic avenue towards the statue. In addition, a basalt stone altar table stands at Bastet’s 
feet; typically incense is burning on the altar and small offerings (rats, mushrooms, locks of hair) are scattered about it. Three open basalt chests line the north wall. The walls are empty of decoration save for the south wall, on which is painted an enormous cat’s eye.

Statue of Bastet: The 20’-tall statue is formed of black basalt, and takes the form of a standing, cat-headed woman. Bastet cradles her sistrum in her left hand and points outwards with her right. She wears a modest gold hoop earring in one ear. The statue is carved such that Bastet is trampling a large serpent under her feet. 

Basalt Chests: The three chests contain the accumulated wealth of the cult, mostly in the form of offerings made to Bastet in antiquity (but including some of more recent vintage). One chest contains 31,738 ancient copper bits (see Arden Vul items). The second has 11,349 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) mixed with 3,577 sp. The third contains 6,721 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items) and 2,811 gp.

Cat’s Eye: The eye painted on the south wall is enchanted. It initially appears as a narrowed eye with yellow iris and black, vertical pupil. The pupil moves to follow any visitor to the inner temple who is not wearing one of the moons of Bastet (see new magic items). Should the cult statue be molested or any of the temple treasure be stolen, Bastet will curse the malefactor. The curse takes the form of a permanent eye blazoned on the victim’s forehead; in addition to this unusual ornament, the cursed person(s) will be considered inimical to all felines. Larger felines may attack, while smaller species will avoid the malefactor and hiss appropriately.

Secret Doors: The two doors are easy to locate (1 in 4), but impossible to open unless the trigger is known. The trigger is the seated cat statuette in the middle of the upper right register on the outer wall of the inner temple (see description at 8-38). If the statuette is pulled forward, both secret doors open instantly. It is easy, of course, for a maubaste to climb to this statuette and trigger the doors.

Treasure:
See temple treasury contents above.

### 8-40: Tomb of the Founder

The sarcophagus of Berenib dominates this roughly-carved, 8’-tall, granite chamber. The walls are painted with simplistic images of cats being worshipped by stick-figure-like humans.

Sarcophagus: Formed of shaped bluestone, the sarcophagus is carved on all sides. The short sides show figures of a seated Bastet, while the long sides offer the following inscription in Mithric: “Berenib, high priestess, who refused to bow to the archon // and who led the children of Bastet to a new home.” The lid contains an image of a woman with cat ears, dressed in a simple tunic. The incised image on the lid is picked out by gold fill (100 gp). 

Within the sarcophagus is Berenib, now a mummy, albeit one who appears more as a mummified giant cat than as a human. She only confronts intruders if her sarcophagus is violated. Berenib cannot be turned while in the environs of the shrine of Bastet. 

GM Note: As the conflicts between Sortians and Theosophs began to accelerate, the archon, Alcibiades the Hunter (ruled 1717-1734 AEP), imperiously commanded that all the priesthoods join him in locating and arresting all those suspected of Sortian sympathy. Alone among the high priests and priestesses, Berenib of Bastet refused. She and the majority of her followers absconded with the temple treasury and fled to the lower reaches of Arden Vul, where they hid for several decades. Then, as the Archontean hegemony collapsed above, Berenib and her priestesses constructed a new temple to Bastet here on Level 8. For her actions, she was deemed a traitor by the Basileus and the archon; official record of the Arden Vul temple of Bastet was expunged. The cult of Bastet has remained secret since that date, with new priestesses periodically guided by Bastet to her shrine where they take up their destined roles.

Berenib the cat-mummy: SZ M; AL LE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 6+3; HP 48; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12. Special attacks: fear; rotting disease. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from magic weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis Berenib wears an amulet of fire resistance (see new magic items) and is, as noted above, immune to turning so long as she remains between areas 8-31 and 8-41.

Treasure:
Berenib wears an amulet of fire resistance (see new magic items) and a jade necklace with a jet representation of a seated cat (350 gp).

Inside the sarcophagus is a set of four jade cups and a jade ewer (total 500 gp); one of the cups is actually a jade cup of life restoration with 4 charges (see new magic items).

### 8-41: Catacombs of the Cat Goddess

The short flight of stairs from 8-40 leads to the burial chambers of previous priestesses of Bastet. The area is roughly carved out of the local granite, with niches for the mummified remains of centuries of priestesses. Over seventy five bodies are present in the niches, all carefully mummified. In addition, the western extension of the catacombs contains a mountain of mummified cats, each representing the favorite cat of one of the high priestesses. A small (3’-diameter) hole leads to one of the cat tunnels to the south.

There is a 15% chance that any mummified human has either a jade amulet (150 gp), a jet figurine of Bastet (175 gp), or a silver and enamel necklace (75 gp). It takes one turn to search a mummy.

One of the mummified corpses in the northwestern alcove is different from the others: it is that of Gennadius, leader of the kentarchia of the 3rd Tagmata that fled the military disaster of the Cave of Blood (7-76) only to become ensorcelled by Deino (3-158). Kentarch Gennadius, and his faithful whippet, Rex, managed to escape Deino and wandered. They came to the Inn of the Lost (6-8), where Gennadius recognized Thegan’s true identity; Thegan ambushed the pair and threw them down the hole at 6-20/8-33. Badly wounded, Gennadius and his dog were, strangely enough, taken in by the cult of Bastet. In return for their service to the high priestess, she accorded them full rights of mummification. Gennadius’s mummy is wrapped in linen as usual, but has a gold death mask (450 gp) that clearly reveals a male face with a military haircut; inscribed on the reverse of the mask are the words, “Gennadius, protector.” Should the death mask be removed, the benign ghost of Gennadius materializes.

Gennadius’s ghost speaks in an old-fashioned dialect of Archontean, and is blunt and crude, like the old soldier that he was. Gennadius pleads with PCs to let his body rest, and, in particular, to not disturb his mummy (including the mask). He also inquires about the fate of his men from the 3rd Tagmata, and begs interlocutors to rescue them from the clutches of ‘that witch, Deino’ (3-158). The ghost offers to provide important secrets and the possibility of great wealth if the PCs bring him proof of Deino’s demise (say, by producing her head). Should the PCs do this, Gennadius explains the identity of Thegan White-Mane (6-19) and describes how to access Thegan’s secret treasuries (6-20).

Gennadius’s ghost: noncombatant.

3-12 domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5(x3), 4(x3), 3(x3), 2(x3); #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

Treasure:
Each of the 74 mummies may have a piece of jewelry (see above). Gennadius’s death mask is worth 450 gp.

### 8-42: Feral Cat Colony

A large colony of feral cats inhabits the caves south of the shrine to Bastet (8-42 to 8-45, 8-49, 8-50). About 60 cats of numerous breeds and colors make up the colony. The cats hunt along the chasm walls, but also frequently venture into the precincts of Bastet (via tunnels at 8-37, 8-38, 8-41, and the corridor outside 8-38) for handouts from the priestesses. 

This particular cave is 8’ tall in the center, and dotted with ledges and crevices that are perfect for cat nests. At any given moment 11-18 cats are present here. The cats are not naturally aggressive, but do defend their turf.

11-18 feral domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5(x4), 4(x5), 3(x5), 2(x4); #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only 
surprised 1 in 6.

### 8-43: Stinking Cave 

The colony of feral cats uses this cave as a litter box, which incidentally helps ward off unwanted predators from the chasm. As a result, the stench of feline urine is rather overpowering. Spending more than a turn here imposes a -1 penalty to CON for 6 turns. At 
any given moment 1-4 cats are present here, doing their business.

1-4 domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5, 4, 3, 2; #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

### 8-44: Water Hole

This cave is dominated by a pool of clear water in its southern projection. It is visited frequently by the cats of the feral colony; at any given moment 8-15 cats are present here.

8-15 domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5(x3), 4(x3), 3(x3), 2 (x3), 1(x3); #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

### 8-45: Cat Colony, Redux

This large cave is home to the majority of the feral cat colony that occupies the area. A strip of sand runs through the center of the cave, on which are the skeletons of scores of small rodents. At any given moment 21-30 cats are present in niches along the walls.

Buried in the sand is the ancient corpse of an adventurer on which some loot may still be found.

21-30 domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5(x7), 4(x8), 3(x8), 2(x7); #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

Treasure:
A set of chain mail +2, a heavy crossbow of speed, a pouch with 15 pieces of jet (100 gp each), and a potion of healing.

## Level 8: 46 - 60

### 8-46: Rudishva Corridor Fragment

Most of the black octagonal sheathing has fallen from the walls of this section of broken corridor, resulting in piles of dusty black granite on the floor. A sinkhole at the western edge of the fragment provides access to the tunnels of the feral cat colony. Next to the rudishva iris door to 8-47 someone has crudely painted an image of a figure dancing on one leg with the words (in Archontean): “Beware the Dancer Within.” 

### 8-47: Rudishva Security Station

One of the important rudishva security centers in antiquity, this chamber is clad in octagonal black-granite sheathing and has no 90-degree angles. A 10’x10’ table occupies the center of the chamber; its top is a piece of black glass. Several stools are parked around the table. The north and east walls contain consoles made of plasteel. A pedestal in the northeast corner holds a stone nataraja (see new monsters – rudishva animated constructs), still futilely guarding the otherwise empty chamber. 

Wall Consoles and Holographic Table: The two consoles are ident-ical, allowing a pair of operators to produce holographic and other effects on the table in the center of the chamber. Each console is made of orange plasteel, inset with a score of octagonal buttons 
with glyphs on them, plus several knobs and ‘joysticks’. The northern console is in poor repair, however, and will explode in a cascade of sparks after being manipulated thrice (e.g., pushing three buttons, or operating the joystick three times, etc.). The eastern console may be operated without danger.

Wrapped in oilcloth under the eastern console is a tactical suit (see new technological items).

Using the Console: The Rudishva glyphs were specially created to describe the locations to which they connect. This means that even someone with a limited knowledge of Rudishva is unlikely to be able to simply ‘read’ the glyph. When a glyph is punched, the GM should roll randomly to determine which location is connected to that glyph. Once a location is connected to a glyph, PCs will be able to select a given location to view.

1 rudishva animated constructs - stone nataraja (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 56; #AT 1; Dmg 4-11; MR 25%. Special attacks: sonic or fire attack. Special 
defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold, fire, electricity, poison, and mind-affecting spells.

Treasure:
Tactical suit (see new technological items).

### 8-48: Rudishva Corridor Fragment

This fragment of ancient rudishva corridor is in bad shape. Most of the octagonal white wall sheathing has collapsed in piles on the floor, and the entire area is home to numerous rats. 

7-18 ordinary rats: SZ S; AL N(E); AC 7; MV 150’; HD 1/4; HP 1 each; #AT 1; Dmg 1.

### 8-49: Reeking Cave

Like area 8-43, this cave smells strongly of cat reek. Although none of the cats from the feral colony (see 8-42 to 8-45, 8-50) live here, they frequently travel through it on their way to hunt insects and rodents to the north. Typically 1-4 cats may be found here.

1-4 domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5, 4, 2, 2; #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

### 8-50: Still More Feral Cats

As it provides direct access to the shrine of Bastet, this cave is a favorite one in which members of the feral cat colony prowl, play, and wait for the priestesses to offer them food. The opening to 8-39 is 3’ in diameter, and 15-20 cats are usually found here.

15-20 feral domestic cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 150’; HD 1-5 HP; HP 5(x5), 4(x5), 3(x5), 2(x5); #AT 2; Dmg 1-2/1. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only 
surprised 1 in 6.

### 8-51: Rudishva Hall

The black granite octagonal sheathing has fared better in this antechamber to the detention block. The walls gleam with black, and offer no 90-degree angles. Stairs lead down to area 8-53. The stairs are littered with bits of broken bone. A rudishva iris door openable only with a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items) occupies the south wall.

### 8-52: Rudishva Teleporters

The door from 8-51 is a rudishva iris door, and only opens when a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque is presented (see new technological items). The t-shaped chamber possesses no 90-degree angles, is spotlessly clean, and is sheathed with beautiful black granite panels in the usual octagonal pattern. In each arm of the chamber a 5’-diameter circle of silvery material is inset in the floor, with a 10”x10” square of the same material affixed to the wall. 

Each square has a different rune etched into the silvery material.

The rudishva built these niches to be part of their teleportation network. To activate them, one stands on a silvery circle and touches the adjacent silvery square; teleportation to the appropriate location is instantaneous. 

Teleport Nodes:
T18: access to Level 7 (7-110)
T19: access to Level 9 (9-97)

### 8-53: Rudishva Detention Block

This area served as a detention center for members of the rudishva hegemony. The entire area is sheathed in octagonal black granite tiles, and no 90-degree angles are present. The cells proper are labeled A through H; the western portion features an oval console surrounded by plasteel stools. Lockers line the north and south walls. The west wall once held a huge black glassteel view screen, but it was shattered in antiquity and its shards now litter the floor under the wall. 

A pile of corpses lines the hallway to 8-51. Some of these corpses are human, both ancient Archonteans and more recent adventurers, some are varumani (see new monsters), three are 
kaliyani (see new monsters), and two are large horned and taloned creatures (demons).

The oval console has been subject to much damage and is inoperable. The lockers, which used to store weapons and equipment, are empty, and their doors are merely twisted and blasted pieces of plasteel.

As the type IV demon (see below) is not always present, and only attacks once the western chamber is fully entered, most of the corpses in the hallway have been looted pretty thoroughly. A few bits of treasure do remain.

Gate: The most imposing sight in the room is a 10’-diameter black disk of pulsating energy that floats above the oval console. This disk detects of magic and of evil; it is, in fact, a permanent one-way gate to the Abyss that was conjured over a millennium ago by a long forgotten wizard. A type IV demon waits behind the disk, sent here by the master of its layer of the abyss in order to investigate the gate and possibly close it. This demon has enjoyed lurking here for years at a time so as to ambush those foolish enough to investigate the gate. At times it returns to the abyss, though; there is a 15% chance that when the chamber is entered, the demon will be gone. Otherwise it waits in ambush so as to add to the pile of corpses. 

Strangely, the demon does not bother Kerbog Khan’s automatons as they pass from 8-54 to other areas of the Halls.

Cells: Each cell is carved from the bare granite, and features a plasteel cot and bucket. Originally force screens prevented the incarcerated from leaving, but the power supply (operated at the console in the west of the area) failed, and all the cells are open. Most of the cells are empty, save for the following:

Cell A: A perfectly circular, highly polished, 6’-diameter tunnel leads west from the back wall of this cell (see 8-54).

Cell C: The desiccated corpse of a rudishva crewman, still wearing her orange jumpsuit, lies on the floor of the cell. Forgotten by her jailors, she died of dehydration after the complex was abandoned during the collapse. In her boot is a bronze rudishva identity plaque (See new technological items).

Cell G: The body of an elven adventurer rests here. He was wounded badly by the demon and crawled here to die. 

1 type IV demon: SZ L; AL CE; AC -1; MV 90’, 120’ flying (Class E); HD 11; HP 81; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/2-8; MR 65%. Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +2 to hit; cause 
fear; darkness 10’ radius; use symbol (fear or discord). Special defenses: half damage from cold, electricity, fire, gas; +1 or better weapons to hit. Special: teleport without error; detect magic; read languages; telekinesis (5,000 gp); project image; create illusion; levitate; polymorph self; dispel magic; gate in demon of type I to IV (60%).

Treasure:
Amid the corpses: a scattering of 201 cp, 177 sp, 149 gp, and six 100 gp pearls; a robe of the archmagi (white); a war hammer +3; a wooden shield +2; 6 crossbow bolts of fire (see new 
magic items); a suit of chain mail; a slim codex containing the Cantor’s Lament (see 8-148); a gold key to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D); and a carved ivory puzzle box depicting elephants and other animals (3,500 gp).

On the elven adventurer: a suit of elven chain mail +1, a rope of climbing, an elixir of youth, of two fire opals (1,000 gp each) and four peridots (500 gp each).

### 8-54: Tunnel to SL12-21 (Workshops of Kerbog Khan)

A 5’-diameter, spiral tunnel leads wends its way upwards some 1,050’ to the workshops of Kerbog Khan (SL12-21). The tunnel perfectly smooth and regular, as if it had been dug and smoothed by machinery. Although it slopes upward continuously, the gradient of the slope is just gentle enough to allow bipeds to climb it with some caution. This is one of the primary routes by which Kerbog Khan’s automatons leave his workshops in order to gain 
access to the rest of the Halls. Note that there is a 20% chance of encountering one of Kerbog Khan’s automatons, the borer, in the tunnel: see text at SL12-21.

### 8-55: Cave of Peabo

An exiled lesser varumani named Peabo inhabits this cave. The cave is 15’ tall and has a small natural basin with fresh water. Peabo otherwise survives on rats and small vermin. His security is ensured by the relative proximity of the citadel of the Sun-Scarred Knights (see new monsters), whose members come and go via 8-56; the knights, on the other hand, tolerate Peabo as a vermin remover and as a sort of canary in the coalmine, alerting them to 
potential dangers. 

Peabo was exiled from the court of the troll thegn (7-74) for refusing to support the thegn’s recent expansionist policies. He would be interested in any intrigues designed to bring down 
the thegn, and might be able to put those he considers friendly into touch with other varumani of similar sympathies. Peabo has occasionally crept up the stairs at 8-56 and can describe the outer precincts of the citadel of the Sun-Scarred Knights (SL10A-1 to SL10A-7, and SL10A-14); he knows several of the knights by name and interest.

If a noticeably hostile and powerful party enters his chamber, Peabo quickly drinks his potion of invisibility and tries to escape. Otherwise he is happy to negotiate, trading information for food and small valuables.

Peabo, a lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 55; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (mattock, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-
affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: mattock, one dose of varumani knock-out juice (see Arden Vul items).

Treasure:
Two potions of invisibility, kept in the basin of water so they remain ‘fresh’, as well as a pouch with 8 pearls (100 gp each) hidden under a rock.

### 8-56: Rudishva Hall, Stairs Up to SL10a-1 

This rudishva hall is similar in physical respects to area 8-51, with black octagonal sheathing and no 90-degree angles. The stairs, however, rise rather than descend, and lead eventually to SL10A-1, just outside the citadel of the Sun-Scarred Knights.

The passage of some creatures through the hall and up the stairs is obvious; a good tracker might be able to detect that these creatures were armored.

### 8-57: Cave, with Charred Spiders

A clear path leads through this 8’-tall cave. In the southern niche are the roasted corpses of three huge spiders, who rather unwisely thought to make this cave their home and were incinerated by the first Sun-Scarred Knight (see new monsters) to pass this way.

### 8-58: Cave

The only noteworthy feature of this cave is the clear path leading from one exit to the other. 

### 8-59: Ruined Corridor

Once a portion of a rudishva corridor, this area is noticeable for major cave-ins along the west, south and east walls. Only along the north side is the original black granite octagonal sheathing still present. Someone has chalked the following words in Archontean along the remaining sheathing: “Seek the Khan to the west, near the prison. His contracts must be sealed with blood.”

### 8-60: Sandy Cave, with tunnel up to SL15-12

This cave is covered in sand, within which lair 8 very hungry sand worms (see new monsters). 

The tunnel to the northwest ascends over a half mile before intersecting another set of tunnels, namely SL15-12.

8 sand worms (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7/2; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 14, 13(x3), 12, 12; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attack: slurp blood (1-4 HP/rd).

## Level 8: 61 - 75

### 8-61: Cave with Lantern

A glowing lantern hangs from an iron shepherd’s crook stuck into the floor in the center of this large cave. The hooded lantern is lit by a continual light spell. The Sun-Scarred Knights (see new monsters) created the lantern, as this is one of their main routes into other areas of the Halls. 

### 8-62: Ruined Rudishva Corridor

This area still displays its origin as a rudishva corridor along its west wall: no 90-degree angles and black granite, octagonal sheathing, half of which has fallen to the floor. The east side, however, has been subject to a major cave-in, rendering it unstable and dangerous. The western extension shows signs of a recent battle, with scorch marks marring the remaining sheathing and a few pieces of broken metal on the floor. One of Kerbog Khan’s rare battle automatons (see new monsters) is investigating the scene; it attacks any so foolish as to interrupt it. 

GM Note: The ‘battle’ took place between Glif, the varumani first adept (see 7-24), and one of Kerbog Khan’s exploration automatons; Glif blasted it with lightning, and then took it off to her chamber for study.

1 battle automaton of Kerbog Khan (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 0; MV 150’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 4; Dmg special; MR 50%. Special attacks: laser (3-12 damage); blade (3-12 damage); poison injector (death, or 3-12 damage on save); flamethrower (3-18 damage in arc). Special defenses: immune to cold and fire.

### 8-63: Pollen-Filled Cave 

This cave marks the westernmost edge of the pollen effect given off 
by the bliss flowers found in 8-67 (see description in level overview). 
Any person entering the cave must save versus petrification with a 
-3 penalty or wander in random directions for 1-6 hours.

### 8-64: Invisible Stalker 

An invisible stalker, summoned by Juliana (8-37), is hunting in this otherwise nondescript wet cave. It has been ordered to circle the precincts of Bastet and eliminate any threats to the shrine for a period of twenty years, and it takes its orders quite literally. This means that if a party does not appear overt or hostile, it will ignore them. If they have entered the cave bearing unsheathed weapons, or have recently or loudly engaged in combat, then it will attack. If the stalker has been encountered as a wandering monster in the pollen-filled areas and defeated, it obviously won’t be present here.

1 invisible stalker: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 55; #AT 1; Dmg 4-16; MR 30%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-5. Special defenses: invisibility.

### 8-65: Bloodless Corpse

A human-sized form crouches in the center of the room, facing the southeastern wall. A continual light rock in front of the corpse casts shadows throughout the chamber.

Closer inspection reveals that the form is that of a human adventurer clutching the spear that pierced his chest and apparently killed him. Even closer inspection reveals a pair of bite marks on his neck. The corpse holds no valuables.

GM Note: The adventurer is an Archontean fighter whose party became lost in the Nether Reaches. After a falling out, this poor fellow was attacked and left to die by his former colleagues. Ironically, it was not the spear thrust but the vampire, Cinna Minux (7-122), that killed him. 

### 8-66: Statue of Chibalba 

An 8’-tall statue of the Archontean deity Chibalba occupies the center of this partly ruined, 15’-tall hall. The eastern side retains its worked features – typical Archontean stonework, with frescoes that have run into smears of unrecognizable color. The western side has collapsed, leaving piles of broken masonry and rough rock. 

A 10’-diameter mosaic surrounds the statue; it depicts pastoral subterranean scenes, including lizards, mushrooms, sarcophagi, bats, altars, etc. The door to 8-5 is obviously new and in good repair; it is locked and barred from the south.

Statue: The blue granite statue of Chibalba is in bad shape. The head has been knocked off, and is nowhere to be found. From the badly corroded remains of the statue, it appears that the statue depicted a cloaked figure holding a staff in one hand and a lantern in the other. Anyone familiar with the cult of Chibalba will have no problems recognizing these as the iconic images associated with this protector of subterranean regions and travelers.

The base of the statue reads, in Mithric: “Chibalba, lord of the Deeps, watches over these halls. Summon him if thy need is great.” Should anyone standing on the mosaic either 1) state Chibalba’s name three times in a row, or 2) declaim “I summon thee, Chibalba!”, an avatar of the deity will arrive to lend temporary aid and protection to the invokers. The aid imparted by the avatar will depend on the needs of those making the invocation; the GM should use his/her best judgment in determining which situation is most appropriate based upon the table below.

Situation Aid offered

In combat Avatar fights for duration of one combat: AC 

0, HD 8, HP 58, #AT 1, damage 1-10
Badly wounded Cure critical wounds x2
Lightly wounded Cure serious wounds x2
Uninjured plaDetect traps, infravision, and locate 

ce (see new spells), all good for 10 turns

Speaking in the Mithric language, the avatar describes in a solemn, deep voice what aid it will impart. This advice takes one round to describe, after which the avatar will not communicate in any way.

Summoning the avatar is only possible once per month. 

Should a cleric of Chibalba invoke the deity, then all four types of aid will be proffered to the cleric and his friends (with the combat avatar serving the cleric for one whole day, or until it is destroyed, whichever comes first).

Note: Two other identical statues of Chibalba may be found, at 4-69 and 9-87.

##### 8-66a: Concealed Entrance

A permanent illusion of a continuous cavern wall conceals the entrance to this tunnel. The tunnel is used by the Sun-Scarred Knights (see new monsters) to access 8-29 and from it, the upper levels of Arden Vul. 

### 8-67: Cave of the Bliss Flowers

This warm, brightly-lit cavern hums with the buzz of insects moving amid field of 6’-tall flowers. The cavern is over 100’ tall in places, and features some worked areas on the south and north walls. The ledge at 8-11 is 60’ above the floor, and the entrances to 8-69 and 8-70 are 30’ above the floor. The floor is relatively flat, and is covered in a thick layer of humus. The walls drip with water, making the environment a bit humid.

The cavern has a long history. It was known to the rudishva as the ‘Cave of Tears’, since a majority of the varuda flyers were wiped out here in a heqeti ambush during the early years of the struggle between these two peoples. After centuries of desuetude the cavern became the site of a series of botanical and entomological experiments by a pair of Archontean eccentrics, the functionary Valens the proedros and his magic user accomplice, Houlios (see 
8-21). The results of their extensive experiments, which they called the Golden Nectar Project, persist, and have produced a strange mini-ecosystem.

The cave is lit by bright, warm sunlight, comparable to the light of a warm summer day. Houlios’s unique spell, sun’s gift (see new spells), is the source of the light and heat. He cast over a dozen instances of the spell all over the ceiling and walls of the area; these could be dispelled individually, but only by a magic user of at least 12th-level.

Five steam vents scattered across the cavern floor provide the heat and moisture necessary for the plant life that occupies it. If standing directly over a vent when it discharges (once every 3 turns), a PC takes 1-8 HP scalding damage.

A vast field of bliss flowers (see new flora) thrives in the light and warmth. These flowers are about 6’ tall and boast beautiful yellow flowers. The flowers have a rapid sexual cycle thanks to Houlios’s experiments. This means that even after they release their pollen and decay, new plants spring up from the decayed remains within days. 

Along the edge of the cavern grow some other plants, albeit in smaller numbers: some small alders, crepe myrtles, and chaste trees, plus numerous wild flowers. None of these additional plants are particularly healthy or vigorous specimens, but they do add biodiversity to the cavern.

A haze of bliss-flower pollen fills the cavern (and many surrounding chambers). While the giant bees (8-69 and 8-70) collect much of the pollen, the plants are so prolific that their 
pollen is literally everywhere. This means that those exploring the cavern must make a save versus petrification at -3 or wander in random directions, blissfully unaware of their surroundings, for 1-6 hours.

Giant bees from 8-69 and 8-70 flit among the flowers nearly continuously, producing an audible hum throughout the cavern. Most of these bees are workers, but if the workers are disturbed soldier bees will emerge from the hives to lend assistance

There is a 10% chance that Olaf the bee whisperer is wandering among the flowers (see 8-73).

Ledges on the wall of the cavern lead to other parts of the level. The ledge to 8-68 is 20’ above the floor, the ledges to the bee hives (8-69 and 8-70) is 30’ above the floor, and the ledge to 8-113 is 40’ above the floor.

Those who dig in the humus of the cave floor have no difficulty in turning up various objects of interest. Almost any place one digs (i.e., 75% chance) reveals the bones of a medium-sized, winged biped; these are varuda bones (see new monsters), and the product of a great massacre during the rudishva-heqeti wars. The area directly under the ledge at 8-11 also bears interest: the skeleton of several humans, with some gear. (GM Note: these are the remains of Jadon and the linkboys of his party, who ran in terror to 8-11 and fell to their doom in the cavern – for Jadon, see 8-10). In addition to these results, each turn of searching in the humus has a 1 in 4 chance of turning up one item from the following table (the first three items may be found up to 3 times each):

Treasure:
On Jadon’s body: banded mail +1, a metal shield, a battle axe, an amulet of courage (see new magic items), an Alexia’s useful pole (see new magic items), and a purse with 79 sp and 43 gp.

### 8-68: Darkened Cave with Roper

This section of the larger cavern rises 20’ above the floor of 8-67, up a scree of loose rock. It is dark, and its floor is uneven rock, with lumps, boulders, and small stalagmites. While no bliss flowers grow here, their pollen floats throughout the area in a thick haze. Those breathing the pollen must save versus petrification at -3 or wander in a random direction for 1-6 hours. 

The cave is well-suited to climbing vines of a number of species. The walls and eastern section of floor are covered with a mat of vines with pale, whitish leaves. The vines conceal the entrance to areas 8-128, 8-129 and 8-134 (the latter of which is located 10’ up the south wall of this cavern).

A stone table overlooks the drop-off to 8-67; Houlios used it while preparing the bliss flower and bee experiments for the Golden Nectar Project. The long-decayed skeletal remains of 
Houlios lie next to the table, still wearing the prototype ‘bee-suit’ that he used when collecting honey from the bee hives (see Arden Vul items). A slash in the back of the suit shows how Houlios died (a dagger from a deranged apprentice). If the slash is fixed, the suit 
would provide excellent protection against giant bee stings.

A clever and extremely hungry roper lurks in this darkened chamber, feeding off the occasional lost bee and hoping for better prey. It prefers to take the form of a low boulder lying just behind Houlios’s corpse. It waits until visitors are inspecting the corpse before striking with a 3 in 6 chance of surprise. The roper is daunted by the bright light and swarms of bees, and so does not typically visit 8-67.

1 roper: SZ L; AL CE; AC 0; MV 30’; HD 11; HP 78; #AT 1; Dmg 5-20; MR 80%. Special attacks: six poisonous strands (20’-50’ range; reduce STR by 50% in 1-3 rds). Special defenses: immune to lightning; take half damage from cold.

Treasure:

Houlios’s bee suit (see Arden Vul items).

Inside the roper’s gut: four golden topaz gems (500 gp each), plus a pink diamond (5,000 gp)

### 8-69: Hive of Golden Nectar 

This chamber was specially built by Valens and Houlios to house one of the hives of giant bees that formed part of the Golden Nectar 

Project (see 8-67). The ceiling is 40’ above the floor, and the entire chamber plus the entrance from the south are of neatly worked, but undecorated, stone. The northern exit is unfinished, and turns swiftly into a natural tunnel.

The air is thick with bliss flower pollen and the drone of scores of bees.

The hive is enormous, and is composed of three huge combs attached to the ceiling and walls. Each comb is 50’ wide and 30’ tall, and has 5’-deep cells on each side. Thus each comb is 10’ wide. Each comb is separated from its neighbor (or the north or south wall) by a 5’-wide space, which allows the bees to move about the hive. In addition, 10’ of space separates the floor from the bottom of the combs. The upper 20’ of each comb is devoted to honey storage, while lower 10’ has cells for larval production. The queen typically moves about in the lower third of the combs, attended by her drones. 

The bees are initially unconcerned by the arrival of man-sized visitors on the floor of their hive, although there is a 25% chance per turn that a bee may blunder into one of the PCs, potentially leading to combat. Should the PCs try to climb or fly among the combs, however, the bees rally to defend their turf.

There are approximately 50 cells filled with the bees’ special honey on each side of each comb (a total of 300 cells). Most cells (250 of them) contains regular honey (50 gp worth per cell), but 50 of the cells contain royal jelly. Each of the royal jelly cells contains sufficient special honey to make 1-3 potions of extra healing, although it will take quite a lot of containers to transport the stuff to a suitable alchemist. In addition, lodged in the topmost row of cells in the middle comb is the scepter of the goblins (see new magic items; also see Gislu the goblin mystic at 4-2, and King Weskenim at SL4-22).

Olaf the bee-whisperer (8-73) has a 25% chance to be present in the hive, either observing the bees (33%) or climbing the comb to collect some honey for his meal (66%). 

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

Listed here are the total population numbers for the first hive. Bees encountered and destroyed elsewhere (e.g., 8-67 or as wandering monsters) should be deleted from the roster. So long as the queen lives, losses can be replaced within a week.

1. Queen bee: noncombatant, SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 0’; HD 10; HP 74; #AT 0.
2. 4 drone bees: noncombatant, SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 90’; HD 5; HP 34, 33, 22, 20; #AT 0.
3. 15 giant soldier bees: SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 120’, 300’ flying (Class C); HD 4+2; HP 32, 31, 31, 30, 29, 28(x3), 27, 26(x3), 25(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: sting once; poison (-1 to saves).
4. 99 giant worker bees: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 90’, 300’ flying (Class D); HD 3+1; 24(x9), 23 (x10), 22(x10), 21(x10), 20(x10), 19(x10), 18(x10), 17(x10), 16(x10), 15(x10); #AT 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: sting once; poison.
5. Olaf the bee-whisperer (25%): see 8-73

Treasure:
Honey, potentially 12,500 gp worth; royal jelly, enough for 50-100 potions of extra healing; The scepter of the goblins (see new magic items).

### 8-70: Second Hive of Golden Nectar

The second hive of giant bees is identical in almost every way to the hive at 8-69, complete with three massive combs spaced in the same way. Of course there is no scepter of the goblins here. 

As with the first hive, Olaf the bee-whisperer (8-73) has a 25% chance to be present here, either observing the bees (33%) or climbing the comb to collect some honey for his meal (66%). Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

Listed here are the total population numbers for the second hive. Bees encountered and destroyed elsewhere (e.g., 8-67 or as wandering monsters) should be deleted from the roster.

1. Queen bee: noncombatant, SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 0’; HD 10; HP 74; #AT 0.
2. 4 drone bees: noncombatant, SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 90’; HD 5; HP 34, 33, 22, 20; #AT 0.
3. 12 giant soldier bees: SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 120’, 300’ flying (Class C); HD 4+2; HP 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 28, 27, 26, 26, 25(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: sting once; poison (-1 to saves).
4. 107 giant worker bees: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 90’, 300’ flying (Class D); HD 3+1; 24(x9), 23 (x10), 22(x11), 21(x11), 20(x11), 19(x11), 18(x11), 17(x11), 16(x11), 15(x11); #AT 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: sting once; poison.
5. Olaf the bee-whisperer (25%): see 8-73

Treasure:
Honey, potentially 12,500 gp worth; royal jelly, enough for 50-100 potions of extra healing.

### 8-71: Cave, with tunnel up to 6-44b

Bare human footprints mark the pollen- and dust-covered floor of this otherwise nondescript cave. They lead to the northwest.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

The southern tunnel leads upwards some 400’ via a number of corkscrew turns and steep cliffs before eventually reaching Level 6 (6-44B). The bliss pollen is gone after 50’ of travel. The tunnel is relatively untraveled, but difficult to traverse, and requires ropes or else three successful rolls of 4d6 under DEX to avoid taking a total of 3-18 damage from falls.

### 8-72: Trapped Cave

Olaf the bee-whisperer (8-73) has arranged a trap in this cave as a way to protect his dwelling from unwanted visitors. A cage woven of reeds is attached to the ceiling above the tunnel leading to the northwest. In it are three angry giant soldier bees. A tripwire across the tunnel entrance is connected to a latch on the bee cage, such that anyone who breaks the wire causes the cage to open and the angry bees to burst forth.

Despite the cleverness of this mechanism, the trapped bees make a fair amount of noise. PCs have a 50% chance of hearing the bees and, thus, of detecting the trap. If PCs stop to listen, the chance rises to 80%.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

3 angry giant soldier bees: SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 120’, 300’ flying (Class C); HD 4+2; HP 29, 28, 25; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: sting once; poison (-1 to saves).

### 8-73: Olaf the Bee-Whisperer

This cave is home to an eccentric, possibly-insane Wiskin adventurer named Olaf. A hammock is slung in the corner, and a tripod of heating (see new magic items) provides warmth. Two dried bee husks are gently pinned to the wall. A striped cat that Olaf has named Lucia pads around the cave; it is immune to the pollen, but wise enough to not stray far from Olaf ’s dwelling. Two decrepit clay urns hold honey harvested from areas 8-69 and 
8-70. Finally, he has rigged a deadfall trap over the entrance. Olaf is home 40% of the time.

Olaf appears as a tall, thin human with black hair and a handsome face. He wears only a loincloth, and his flesh is dirty and pocked with the result of bee stings. His eyes wander constantly, and he has some difficulty maintaining a conversation due to his long residence among bees and bliss pollen. Still, in return for food, Olaf might help a friendly party with directions to other locations in the Nether Reaches. Olaf is familiar with 8-67, 8-68 (and he 
knows of the roper there), 8-69 to 8-76, 8-83 to 8-84, 8-87 to 8-94, and 8-113. Although in some ways starved for conversation, he is loath to abandon his cave. Olaf has been charmed by the vampire, Cinna Minux (7-122); Cinna only rarely visits him, since Olaf ’s information is often garbled.

Trap (deadfall): Those breaking a thin tripwire running 3” above the floor of the entrance (75% chance for any visitor) causes the deadfall to activate. The deadfall inflicts 2-12 HP damage on up to 3 persons near the entrance. More significantly, it causes a loud noise that is likely to bring Olaf running.

GM Note: Olaf was the magic user in an adventuring party that became lost in the Nether Reaches, with each member slowly succumbing to deprivation amid the pollen clouds. Olaf was transformed by long exposure to bee pollen, but did not die. Indeed, after many years of breathing the pollen, he has become immune to its confusion effect. Eventually Olaf discovered the great bee hives (8-69, 8-70) and has been living in symbiosis with them for years, surviving primarily on honey. Although he is regularly stung by the bees, his periapt of proof against poison has protected him from their poison. Over the years he has become grudgingly accepted by the hives.

 Although once a magic user, Olaf lost his spell book and all his equipment. At this point his mind has been so transformed by pollen and bee-honey that even were he escorted to safety, it is unlikely that he would want to practice magic ever again. Still, he once had numerous friends in the College of Macrina (see World of Archontos appendix); they might be willing to assist him if he were brought to the collegium in Narsileon.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

Olaf the bee-whisperer (40%), 7th-level Wiskin magic user: SZ M; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 19; #AT 1; Dmg 2-5 (dagger +1). Abilities: STR 13, INT 8 (formerly 17), WIS 13, DEX 17, 
CON 10, CHA 15. Possessions: dirty linen clothing; 3 doses of varumani knock-out juice (see Arden Vul items); periapt of proof against poison; dagger +1. 

Treasure:
Olaf ’s periapt of proof against poison and his tripod of heating (see new magic items)

### 8-74: Mostly Empty Cave

A broken clay urn lies on the floor of this cave, surrounded by a sticky mass of honey. Bare human footprints lead south.Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see 
new flora).

### 8-75: Large Cave with Pool

The northern-most portion of this large cavern is filled with a 50’-deep pool of cold water. The surface of the water is coated with a thin layer of yellow pollen.

Bare human footprints lead to the east (these are Olaf ’s feet; see 8-73). In addition to Olaf, giant worker bees regularly come here to gather water.

More ominously, if the demonic sounding horn at 8-76 is winded without first ringing the tubular bells around it, the chaotic reverberations have a 50% chance of summoning a worm of Qok (see new monsters) into this pool. The horrible worm is attracted to sound, so once summoned it will begin to slither down the passage to 8-76 (as the horn’s sound resounds for a whole turn). Those present in 8-75 when it emerges from the pool may have difficulties of their own!

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

3-8 giant worker bees: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 90’, 300’ flying (Class D); HD 3+1; 24(x4), 23 (x4), 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: sting once; poison.

1 worm of Qok (see new monsters): SZ L; AL CE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 12; HP 86; #AT 1; Dmg 2-24; MR 50%. Special attacks: swallow.

## Level 8: 76 - 86

### 8-76: The Feasting Hall

This enormous cave is referred to as the Feasting Hall to those few who know of its existence. It is the site of an interdimensional singularity, whereby the abyssal plane on which Rimmaq-Isfet continuously writhes comes into direct contact with the Prime Material plane. 

The cave is very old, with rough walls covered with an oily sheen, and a flat, sanded floor. The ceiling is 30’ tall. Two ledges are built into the east wall; one features a cistern with clear water, while the other holds a large pile of bones. To the south are five pedestals: the central one is home to a 10’-tall demonic sounding horn, while the four surrounding ones hold tubular gongs of various sizes. To the west is a 10’-tall stone ledge running alongside the wall; this is the point where cultists are able to directly contact Rimmaq-Isfet. The center of the chamber holds three stone tables with heavy stone benches. 

Fifteen filthy, long-haired, wild-eyed humans and humanoids are seated at the tables, ravenously devouring thick, juicy steaks. They wear scraps of clothing and boast long, greasy, untended hair. Their bodies are lean, but well-muscled, and their eyes are bright and inquisitive. They greet visitors cheerfully, inviting them in Archontean to join the feast. If questioned, they are unable to recall their own names, or the circumstances of their presence here.

Niches on the Eastern Wall: The northern niche has a 5’-tall retain-ing wall between it and the rest of the cave. The wall forms a kind of cistern, with water dripping from the walls and ceiling collecting here. Two copper dippers sit atop the retaining wall, and a 12’-tall rickety ladder leans against the wall, allowing access to the cistern from the cavern floor. At the bottom of the cistern is a limed-over skeleton of a human with a stone of passage (see new magic items) resting amid the bones; only by swimming in the pool will this item be found.

The southern niche is filled with whitened bones. All are human or humanoid, the remains of previous generations of chaotic feasters. Close inspection of the remains shows that no skulls are present and that many of the long bones have been gnawed. Beneath the bones are the plinth and shattered remains of a heqeti-era statue; the statue depicted a crouching heqeti hopper, but only the head is recognizable.

Lesser Pedestals: Tubular Bells: Five pedestals dominate the south-ern approaches of the cave. Copper tubular bells hang from aged iron racks on the four lesser pedestals. Each bell is artfully etched, albeit with unsettling images and strange glyphs. The glyphs are in an obscure abyssal tongue; in most circumstances, the services of a sage will be necessary to decode them. A wooden mallet is attached to each rack with an ancient, cracked leather cord. 

Striking a bell with its mallet produces a deep, echoing tone. The tubular bells vary as follows, from the northeast pedestal clockwise to the northwest pedestal: 

Size and Musical Note Glyphs and Images

Bell 1: 2’ tall, 6” in diameter, C

Glyphs: “Tairon [the name of this bell] speaks, and the dread lord Rimmaq wakes.”
Images: A thick serpent-like creature snakes around the bell; it is squeezing bipedal crea-
tures with anguished faces 

Bell 2: 3’ tall, 1’ in diameter, E

Glyphs: “Peqar [the name of the bell] speaks, and the ears of dread Rimmaq open”

Images: Heqeti striking a tubular bell similar to this one

Bell 3: 4’ tall, 2’ in diameter, G

Glyphs: “Ivlik [the name of the bell] speaks and the dread lord Rimmaq begins to writhe”
Images: Heqeti carrying human and rudishva heads on spears while leering demonic faces

Bell 4: 6’ tall, 3’ in diameter, B

Glyphs: “Ristik [the name of the bell] speaks, and lord Rimmaq approaches the veil. Bring him home!”

Images: A large heqeti sounds a curved horn of such size that it surrounds his body

The bells could be detached from their mounts and sold to collectors of antiquities and exotica: Tairon would bring 1,000 gp, Peqar 2,000 gp, Ivlik 4,000 gp, and Ristik 8,000 gp. The two larger bells are quite heavy and bulky.

Central Pedestal: the Demonic Sounding Horn: The central pedestal, around which the lesser pedestals of the bells are arranged, contains a huge, spiral horn that rises 10’ above the floor of the pedestal. The horn is supported by three copper rods thrust into the corners of the pedestal. It is possible for a man-sized creature to stand in the center of the pedestal, partly surrounded by the coils of the horn, and sound it. The horn is carved with blasphemous 
images of a large, slug-like creatures feeding continuously on bipedal creatures; the creature is surrounded by salamander-seeming creatures with sharp teeth. A set of glyphs near the mouth of the horn reads (to those able to read abyssal tongues): “Lord Rimmaq-Isfet and his spawn feed on the sacrifices. Summon him at your peril!”

The horn is quite dangerous if used carelessly. Sounding it while the tubular bells are still ringing (see below) produces a potent blast of cacophony that serves to open the rift to the abyss, where Rimmaq-Isfet writhes. Sounding it without first properly ringing the bells, however, has a 50% chance to summon a worm of Qok (see new monsters) at 8-75, and produces a chaotic effect from the following table. If summoned, the worm of Qok arrives 
here within 5 rounds. An individual may only sound the horn once per week. It has no uses outside this chamber (although it might bring 3,500 gp).

D6 Effect

1

Berserk: all within hearing must save vs paralysis or immediately attack a random ‘opponent’. Those of lawful alignments save at +1. The berserk status lasts for 3-6 round per individual.

2

Demonic Assault: a keqemander (see new monsters) appears and attacks savagely until reduced to 1/3 HP, at which point it teleports away. 

3

Abyssal Environment: the temperature of the cavern rises to 110F and an acidic rain drips down from the ceiling. Those in armor have ½ movement, and all take 1-3 HP damage per round from the acid. Effect lasts for a turn.

4

Mark of the Abyss: a tentacular eye appears from the west wall, zooms in on the PC who sounded the horn, scans him/her slowly, and departs. The PC now has a purple tattoo of an eye on his/her forehead, and all creatures associated with the abyss have +1 to hit and damage versus that PC. The mark may only be removed with a remove curse spell.

5

Gravity Reversal: gravity is temporarily reversed in the cavern, such that all unattached items and beings will fall ‘upward’ towards the ceiling, which is the new focus of gravity. Living beings take 3-18 damage, or half damage if a save versus spells is made. The effect lasts for 1-3 turns, at which point a similar ‘falling’ back to the floor occurs (with another chance for damage). 

6

Summoning: a series of heqeti hopping dead (see new monsters) are summoned to the platform along the west wall. Two warriors are summoned per round for 5-8 rounds. The warriors attack PCs first, ignoring the chaotic feasters until/unless the PCs flee.

Accessing the Flank of Rimmaq-Isfet Proper manipulation of the bells and the sounding horn opens a dimensional portal that provides access to the flank of Rimmaq-Isfet. To open the portal, one must first strike each of the tubular bells in turn, starting with C, and proceeding through E, G, and B. While the tones of the tubular bells are still ringing, one then sounds the enormous demonic sounding horn. The combination of the tones is cacophonous, and requires all within hearing to save vs. paralyzation or be stunned for 1-2 rounds. The sounding horn echoes for a full turn, during which time it is possible to harvest ‘meat’ from the flank of Rimmaq-Isfet. 

The Flank of Rimmaq-Isfet: Access to the flank of Rimmaq-Isfet is obtained from the platform that runs across the western side of the cavern. When the tubular bells and sounding horn have been properly employed, anyone standing on the platform will feel 
a light breeze emanating from the wall, bringing with it an array of strong, and mostly unpleasant odors: burnt sugar, ammonia, spoiled eggs, and so forth. A 10’x5’ rectangle of the wall will be seen to ripple gently with motion, and it will be apparent that the section of wall is no longer stone, but rather a mottled grey-green hide. For the turn that the sounding horn echoes, it is possible to carve pieces of this flank as one might a piece of beef. Two 3’-long, curved copper daggers rest on the platform; the chaotic feasters use the daggers to carve meat from Rimmaq-Isfet.

The meat of Rimmaq-Isfet is nutritious and tasty, but consuming it is risky. For each serving consumed, there is a 5% cumulative chance of the diner turning into a chaotic feaster; this 
chance is modified by +25% for those of chaotic evil alignment and +15% for those of chaotic (but not evil) alignments. 

Effects on Rimmaq-Isfet: As Rimmaq-Isfet is an extremely powerful greater deity, one with regenerative powers, it is able to absorb the carving of meat from its flank without truly noticing such actions. Clever PCs might realize, however, that it would be possible to inflict greater harm on Rimmaq-Isfet through the open dimensional portal. Simply hacking at its flesh is easy enough; should 50 HP damage be inflicted in this way, Rimmaq-Isfet will 
notice and move away from the portal. The portal stays open, and foolish PCs could enter the abyss through it if so desired. It is also possible to poison, and hence weaken, Rimmaq-Isfet through the portal. The GM should determine the composition of a suitable ‘poison’; one possibility might be ten flasks of holy water, mixed with 2 oz of unicorn hairs and a pair of brownie eyes. The benefit to PCs of weakening Rimmaq-Isfet through poison will be felt if 
the PCs confront the heqeti on Level 10 (see level introduction for Level 10).

The Chaotic Feasters: An elaborate set of entirely false beliefs has grown up among the society of the feasters, one that seeks to explain in limited ways the situation in which they find themselves. What is most surprising is the fact that the feasters do not realize they are consuming the flesh of a greater god of intense chaotic evil, but instead have come to attribute their bounty to the existence of a vast planar creature they call the throom. The throom, they think, may be singular, or there may be ‘herds’ of them moving through interdimensional space; either way, the throom are so vast and placid that careful harvesting of the throom flesh goes largely unnoticed. It is the good fortune of the feasters, they think, 
to have located a nexus point where they can harvest the throom’s flesh. Beyond their rituals with the throom, the feasters have been known to engage in cannibalism to supplement the regular harvesting of the throom; this is particular true for feasters who have grown old, sick, and/or feeble, but might also apply to nosy visitors. The feasters refer to the western platform as the ‘throom Platform’, and the copper knives as ‘throom knives’, and their meat 
as ‘throom steaks’.

The feasters are welcoming, if slightly suspicious, of newcomers. They invite PCs to share in the throom-bounty, and may (33%) grow enraged if their offer is rejected. If visitors are cautious and respectful, it is possible to inspect the cavern without provoking the feasters. Should PCs seek to remove items (including the bells, the ‘throom-knives’, or anything else), the feasters immediately attack. Should careless PCs sound the demonic sounding horn 
without following the correct procedure with the bells, the feasters turn sullen and uncommunicative; after 4 rounds they attack. 

Finally, if PCs question the feasters too aggressively about their past lives or the meaning of this cavern, they will also grow sullen and uncommunicative and will attack within a turn.

The alpha chaotic feaster: SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 57; #AT 3; Dmg 3-14/2-5/1-3; MR 10%. Special attacks: flying feet (an additional attack sequence doing 2-5 damage), extra-crazy (additional attack sequence doing 1-3 damage with chance for disease). Special defenses: magic immunity, immune to fire.

14 chaotic feasters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 10 or 6; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 30(x3), 29(x3), 25 (x5), 21(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 3-10; MR 10%. Of the fourteen, five have nails of iron (2-9 plus 1-3 bleeding for 3 rounds) and tough skin (AC 4); three have corpse breath (foes save vs poison or spend 2 round retching) and immunity to fire; two have flying feet (an additional attack sequence doing 2-5 damage) and immunity to cold; two have extra crazy (additional attack sequence doing 1-3 damage with chance for disease) and magic immunity (to 1st-level spells); one has mesmerizing eyes (foe saves vs petrification or be charmed) and tough skin (AC 4); and one has extra crazy (see above) and immunity to fire.

1 worm of Qok (see new monsters): see stats at 8-75 (50% chance to arrive 5 rounds after the horn is sounded).

Treasure:
A pair of boxes under one of the tables contains a mixture of treasure: two 10-lb gold bars (500 gp each), 567 gp, 911 sp, a gold brooch with a quartz starbust (1,150 gp), a fine-crystal ewer (150 gp), a set of five copper flasks inscribed with Archontean names (40 gp each), a set of 3 platinum-tipped ivory rods, suitable for using as reading aids (75 gp each), a tarnished silver censer with a dose of incense of relaxation (see new magic items), a set of 12 
arrows +2, an arrow of slaying devils, a military pick +4, a war hammer +3, and a helm of brilliance.

### 8-77: Antechamber

Those using the teleporter at 8-7B appear in a 6’-diameter circle of lapis tile set into the northeast corner of this chamber. 

An Archontean-era construction, the chamber has neatly worked granite surfaces, all of which are blackened by smoke from a large fire that crackles in the center of the chamber. A 10’-square iron grill is hung from the ceiling above the fire; on the grill roast a dozen thick steaks. Two dirty humans crouch near the fire, tending to the meat.

The fire burns more brightly and more hotly than the fuel – some charcoal and some bones – would seem to allow. This is because the rendered fat from the special steaks is highly flammable (indeed, if collected somehow, the fat of three steaks could produce liquid comparable to a flask of oil). 

The cooks are chaotic feasters (see new monsters). They greet visitors cheerfully, inviting them in Archontean to join the feast, which is taking place just down the stairs in the main hall. If questioned, they are also unable to recall their own names, or the circumstances of their presence here. Instead, they rave only about the great food and drink, and the companionship of like-minded friends. Should they be treated roughly or aggressively, they flee to 8-76 to warn their colleagues.

Almost completely concealed behind the soot on the walls is an ancient inscription in Mithric, located above the stairs leading down to 8-76. It reads: “Caveat Comestor” [GM Note: “Let the diner beware”] 

Secret Door (south): The door is standard sized and normal to locate. It is very difficult to open from this side, requiring an open-doors roll to pull it open. It slams shut after one turn in the open position.

2 chaotic feasters (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 10 or 6; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 26, 21; #AT 1; Dmg 3-10; MR 10%. On has nails of iron (2-9 plus 1-3 bleeding for 3 rounds) and 
immunity to cold; the other has mesmerizing eyes (foe saves vs petrification or be charmed) and tough skin (AC 4).

### 8-78: Feasters’ Lair

This chamber is dark and reeks of waste and bodily fluids. The floor is covered with a noxious 2” layer of dirt, filth, and worse. A shelf is set into the walls at a level 6’ above the floor; the shelf contains over a hundred skulls that have been stripped of flesh but are still stained brown and red. These are the remains of previous generations of feasters. 

Hidden among the skulls is an ivory cylinder that can be twisted open to reveal an inner compartment. The cylinder is carved with an image of the emperor Arthuinus the Mighty; the 
emperor is dressed as a scholar, wears a philosopher’s long beard, and is depicted writing at a scribe’s desk. Inside the cylinder is a bit of parchment with the following text: “The cavern below was used by the hoppers to summon their god, and to consume its flesh in debauched rituals. Might it be possible to weaken their slimy lord by making use of the opened portal?” The cylinder is worth 225 gp.

### 8-79: A Second Feasters’ Lair

This chamber is similar in most respects to 8-78, complete with layer of filth and shelf with skulls. An ancient human skeleton is nailed to the east wall, though. 

The skeleton is that of Helibar of Archontos, the last Archontean administrator of this site before the collapse. Helibar’s men grew hungry as supplies from the surface failed, and they began to consume the meat of Rimmaq-Isfet over his objections. Transformed into chaotic feasters, they eventually crucified him on the wall, where he died a slow death. Given the nature of his demise, Helibar’s soul is still close to his body. A speak with dead spell cast by a cleric of at least 13th level will be efficacious, despite the usual restrictions (Helibar has been dead more than 1,200 years). Such a cleric will be able to ask 3 questions of Helibar, thus allowing the PCs to learn something about the nature of area 8-76 (or whatever else they find of interest). If Helibar’s remains are taken down and given a respectful burial, his soul departs and the normal parameters for speak with dead apply.

2 chaotic feasters (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 10 or 6; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 26, 21; #AT 1; Dmg 3-10; MR 10%. 

On has nails of iron (2-9 plus 1-3 bleeding for 3 rounds) and immunity to cold; the other has mesmerizing eyes (foe saves vs petrification or be charmed) and tough skin (AC 4).

### 8-80: Shocking Moss

A rare form of moss, known as shocking moss (see new flora), covers the surfaces of this cave. In the presence of substantial quantities of metal (e.g., metal armor), the moss discharges electric blasts every 3 rounds. These shocks do 3-18 HP damage to anyone bearing metal (save for half damage). Touching (or walking on) the moss doubles the damage. The shocking moss is highly susceptible to fire, and can be burned off with ease. Should it be removed, a crude inscription in Varumani Semi-glyphik will be revealed in the stone of the north wall: it reads “This way to the citadel of the knights”. An arrow points towards area 8-81.

The corridor between 8-80 and 8-81 is covered with more of the moss.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

### 8-81: More Shocking Moss

Both this cave and the tunnel leading west and north to 8-80 is coated in the same shocking moss found at area 8-80. After 3 rounds in either the tunnel or the cave, a discharge worth 3-18 HP will be targeted at a PC wearing metallic armor. Touching the moss doubles the damage.

Another inscription in Mithric lies under the moss in the tunnel that approaches 8-81. It reads: “This way to the citadel” with an arrow pointing towards 8-82.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

### 8-82: Tunnel up to SL10a-9 

This tunnel leads upward at a gentle slope until it reaches area SL10A-9.

Note: For about 50’ this tunnel is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen given off by the bliss flowers in 8-67 (see description in level overview). Any person entering the tunnel must save versus petrification (-3 penalty) or wander randomly for 1-6 hours.

### 8-83: Ruined Storage Room

Once a storage chamber during the Archontean occupation, this chamber is bereft of anything interesting save some bare human footprints in the dust made by Olaf in 8-73; they lead west and south towards 8-74. The western wall of the chamber has collapsed, leaving piles of rubble on the floor.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

### 8-84: Hall of Columnar Heroes

This long hallway served as an important connecting link for the Archontean areas of Level 8. While seismic activity over the past millennium has broken many of the connections, the hall itself is still in good shape.

The hallway is 15’ tall, with sixteen 3’-diameter columns supporting the roof. Each column is carved in the form of an Archontean legionary, complete with banded mail, hoplite helmet, 
spear and gladius. The legionaries face different ways (north, south, etc.). Remnants of paint are visible here and there. The floor is dusty, but bare human footprints come and go towards area 8-83 (these were made by Olaf in 8-73).

One of the legionary columns (marked ‘A’ on the map) is not like the others. A compartment in its helmet opens, revealing an 8”-tall cavity. Inside the cavity is an extremely rare artifact of ancient Archontean sorcery, one of Caldornia’s ausculatoris (see new monsters). This ausculator has the personality of Hamil the Southron, and was one of the main spies of the Archontean forces in Arden Vul more than 1,500 years ago. Hamil has grown insane from his long imprisonment, and proves a dangerous temporary ‘ally’. He greets any rescuer with respect, referring to him/her as ‘guv’nor’ in heavily accented Archontean and offering his services. After 2-12 days, however, Hamil attempts to flee after stabbing his primary ‘guv’nor’ in the eyes while he/she sleeps. Behind the doorway on the western edge of the south wall 
lies a collapsed corridor. Amid the rubble is a forgotten sack of adventuring gear: two coils of rope, six flasks of oil, a set of caltrops, and a potion of healing. The other broken hallways behind the doors on the north and south walls contain nothing of interest.

Hamil the Southron, one of Caldornia’s ausculatoris (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LE; AC -1; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 18; #AT 3/2; Dmg 1-4/1-4; MR 25%. Special attacks: attack as 7th-level fighter. Special defenses: permanent silence; immune to fire, cold, lightning, hold, charm, and mind-affecting spells.

### 8-85: Campsite

The door to this chamber is stuck. The chamber within was once the office of an Archontean bureaucrat, and still features some recognizable painted frescoes showing the counting, storage, and exchange of coins by archaically-dressed officials. All furnishing are long gone, but a previous adventuring party created a convenient firepit here. The site would be a good place at which to camp.Secret Compartment: A secret compartment exists in the west wall. It is difficult to locate (1 in 8), and open by pressing the largest coin on the western fresco. Doing so reveals a 3’x3’ cubbyhole in which are stacked 25 ancient octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items) and 450 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items). 

### 8-86: Boarded-Up Chamber

Someone has attempted to prevent the door to this chamber from being opened from the south: boards run across it, hammered into the stone lintels with spikes. 

Within are the ruins of an Archontean office. The only items of value amid the shattered desks, chairs, and scroll cabinets are a pair of spell scrolls. A pack of wights lurks here, hungry and menacing. They attack ferociously. 

13 wights: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 4+3; HP 35, 34, 33, 31, 30(x3), 29, 28, 27, 26(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic needed to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

Treasure:
Two scrolls, one with the druid spell water breathing and the other with the magic user spell glassee.

## Level 8: 94 - 104 (The Forge and Mines of Zhorak)

The Forge of Zhorak should reveal the origin and nature of the doppelgangers.
* Revamp the business with Lozor Hornfels.  Lozor was Zhorak's chief apprentice, and was replaced by a doppelganger, who trapped and killed Zhorak.
* Among Zhorak's workshop papers:
	* Posters and screeds denouncing the Sortians and exhorting his apprentice-priests not to heed their blandishments the way some in other priesthoods have.
	* Fragmentary notes hinting at a complex project involving pa'ut (the creation of the doppelgangers as spies)
* In his chamber, he has written a confesion and last testament, describing his "profaning of the maker's blood" and his folly.  In secret, he sought to craft shapeshifting spies from pa'ut to root out the Sortians.  But without combining Ptah's craft with the wisdom of Thoth and the true life-giving power of Isis, unlike the homunculi (goblins), he realizes too late that the creations are soulless abominations.  They feed upon the power of the Maker (Ptah), ruining his works and devouring his priests to breed more of themselves.
	* Now he is trapped by the one who stole the form of his apprentice, and they are loose in the world.  It is fitting he perish as punishment for his folly.  Ma'at will not welcome me.

### 8-87: Coal Seam

The rich seam of coal found here was mined by Zhorak in antiquity in order to fuel his forge (8-100). The walls are uneven, with indentations, multiple 3’ mini-tunnels, and so forth. A thick layer of coal dust coats everything, including two stone dwarves apparently frozen in the act of wielding mining picks. The two dwarves are perfect in every respect – enough so that viewers might assume they had been petrified by a basilisk. In fact, the dwarves are constructs, built by Zhorak in his forge and known as Zhorak’s miners (see new monsters).

Close examination of the two dwarves reveals two hints as to their nature: a thin slot in their sides, under the left arm, and faces that are a bit too smooth and idealized to be real. Inside the slot of each is a depleted rudishva lesser power supply (see new technological items). Should a full lesser power be inserted into one of Zhorak’s miners, it will lurch into activity, attempting to complete its mining tasks. Interfering with a miner causes it to attack, at least until the nuisance(s) have retreated.

Given the coal dust on the floor, any use of fire in this chamber is extremely dangerous. Open flame (torches, etc.) has a 25% chance per turn to cause a coal explosion that inflicts 6-36 HP damage on any persons within the chamber. Fire spells produce similar effects.

For every turn the PCs are present there is a non-cumulative 10% chance that the huldugritti from 8-92 (see new monsters) decide to visit this cave. When first encountered, huldugritti are always in spirit form. 

2 Zhorak’s miners (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 5; HP 35, 24; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special defenses: immune to fire, cold, and mind-affecting spells. 

1 huldugritti (see new monsters) (10% chance): for stats see area 8-92.

### 8-88: Depleted Gallery

This seam of iron and coal was mined to near exhaustion in antiquity. A pair of broken picks lies in the dust.

### 8-89: Iron Deposits

This cave contains a rich deposit of iron. Although none of Zhorak’s miners are found here, their labors are evident. A spiral path leads from the floor up the wall of the cavern, rising slowly but steadily and gradually carving out deeper rings in the walls. The path rises a good 35’ in height. 

A pair of baindara (see new monsters), brought here by the dead adventurer on the floor of the cave, chatter nervously at the uppermost limit of the spiral path. More significantly, a huldugritti (see new monsters) lurks here, consuming the delicate iron dust and filings that still remain.

The corpse of a female elven magic user lies on the floor, slain by the huldugritti. The corpse contains some treasure, as well as the magic user’s spell book.

2 baindara (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 8; MV 150’, 150’ gliding; HD 1-1; HP 3, 2; #AT 1; Dmg 1-2.

1 huldugritti (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 0 or 2; MV 120’ or 60’; HD 8+8; HP 50; #AT 2 (in stone form); Dmg 2-16/2-16; MR 25%. Special attacks: hurl boulders (2-8 HP each). Special defenses: meld with stone (cure 3-24 HP); assume spirit form; +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire, electricity, and mind-affecting spells. 

Treasure:

A linen pouch with six 100 gp pearls; a beautiful egg made of solid gold, chased with silver in geometric patterns (775 gp); an elven cloak; a wand of cold (10 charges); a staff +2; a spell book.

Spell Book: Alarm, charm person, detect magic, feather fall, floating disk, friends, hold portal, jump, magic missile, protection from evil; audible glamer; darkness 15’ radius, detect invisibility, flaming sphere, forget, invisibility, magic mouth, mirror image, rope trick, shatter; blink, clairvoyance, cloudburst, dispel magic, explosive runes, fireball, gust of wind, haste, phantasmal force, suggestion, water breathing; charm monster, dig, fire shield, ice storm, plant growth, remove curse, stoneskin.

### 8-90: Depleted Iron Deposits

This side cave proved to contain a rich lode of iron, and Zhorak’s miners extracted nearly every ounce of it. 

For every turn the PCs are present there is a non-cumulative 10% chance that the huldugritti from 8-92 (see new monsters) will have decided to visit this cave. When first encountered, huldugritti are always in spirit form. 

1 huldugritti (see new monsters) (10% chance): for stats see area 8-92.

### 8-91: Mining Supplies

This wide spot in the mine holds two rickety wooden shelves, on which are a variety of mining implements: pick heads, shovels, wedges, mauls, canvas sacks for ore, and so forth. Inside one of the canvas sacks is a gold nugget worth 600 gp.

For every turn the PCs are present there is a non-cumulative 10% chance that the huldugritti from 8-92 (see new monsters) will have decided to visit this cave. When first encountered, huldugritti are always in spirit form. 

1 huldugritti (see new monsters) (10% chance): for stats see area 8-92.

### 8-92: Depleted Coal Seam

A rich coal seam used to run through this cavern, but Zhorak’s miners extracted most of it in antiquity. The remaining dust makes for fine feeding grounds for a huldugritti (see new monsters); if the huldugritti has been encountered elsewhere (see chances at 8-87, 8-90, 8-91 and 8-93) it obviously will not be present here.

1 huldugritti (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 0 or 2; MV 120’ or 60’; HD 8+8; HP 56; #AT 2 (in stone form); Dmg 2-16/2-16; MR 25%. Special attacks: hurl boulders (2-8 HP each). Special defenses: meld with stone (cure 3-24 HP); assume spirit form; +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire, electricity, and mind-affecting spells. 

### 8-93: Active Coal Seam

Two of Zhorak’s miners (see new monsters) are frozen in mid-swing of the pickaxe here, having shut down when their power supplies became depleted. A pile of mined coal lies in the center of the cave. As with area 8-87, the miners could be reactivated by replacing the depleted rudishva lesser power supplies that power them. For every turn the PCs are present there is a non-cumulative 10% chance that the huldugritti from 8-92 (see new monsters) will 
have decided to visit this cave. When first encountered, huldugritti are always in spirit form.

2 Zhorak’s miners (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 5; HP 35, 24; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special defenses: immune to fire, cold, and mind-affecting spells. 

1 huldugritti (see new monsters) (10% chance): for stats see area 8-92.

### 8-94: Mine Entrance

This broad cave was the initial site of Zhorak’s mining endeavors. It is tall (40’), and ringed by a spiral pathway that allowed mining on all sides. At the top of the spiral path (on the west wall, above the passage to 8-95) is a coffer made of carved ivory plates; the carvings show exotic scenes of elephants being ridden into battle by distinctly non-Archontean humans. The coffer itself is worth 500 gp, but also contains a heqeti ring and an icon of Kauket (see new magic items for each).

A single huldugritti (see new monsters) inhabits this cave. The passage to the west turns into worked stone, but is blocked by a formidable steel portcullis, the lever for which is in area 8-95. A lift gates roll is needed to budge the portcullis from this side.

1 huldugritti (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 0 or 2; MV 120’ or 60’; HD 8+8; HP 52; #AT 2 (in stone form); Dmg 2-16/2-16; MR 25%. Special attacks: hurl boulders (2-8 HP each). Special defenses: meld with stone (cure 3-24 HP); assume spirit form; +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire, electricity, and mind-affecting spells. 

Treasure:
Carved ivory coffer (500 gp); icon of Kauket (see new magic items), and a heqeti ring (see new magic items)

### 8-95: Entrance Hall to the Forge

This tall octagonal chamber was the main public hall for Archontean dignitaries eager to visit the famous forge of Zhorak and, perhaps, to acquire some of the legendary smith’s work. The ceiling here is 30’ tall, and several continual light spells cast on the ceiling provide bright light. 

The walls of the diagonal sides of the chamber are carved as colossal statues of crouching dwarves. These statues are rendered out of huge 10’-thick slabs of black basalt, which Zhorak bolted to the native granite. The dwarves have too-large eyes and thin grins on their half-open mouths; they are depicted in floppy Phrygian caps and tight-fitting leather half-coats. Each holds a distinct tool across its chest: one a hammer, another a set of tongs, the third a fuller, and the last a swage. 

An octagonal dais about 3’ tall occupies the center of the chamber. On the dais are three gleaming, silver, savonarola-style chairs in a row facing north. The chairs are carved with Dwarvish runes and images of dour-faced dwarves. Although the chairs appear to be solid silver, they are actually teak with a thick layer of silver gilt. As objects, they are worth 525 gp each; the silver gilt is worth a total of 175 gp.

##### 8-95a: Tunnel down to 9-139

Amid the wreckage that once connected the forge to area 8-84 is a tunnel delved out of the loose rock. It descends in swoops and whorls at a rather precipitous pitch all the way down to area 9-139.

### 8-96: Ruined Workshop

This was Zhorak’s design workshop, where he planned and sketched the creations he would produce in the forge. It has two beautiful sloped writing desks made of teak (150 gp, but heavy), three teak cabinets for scrolls and paper (100 gp each), plus a pair of teak stools (50 gp). A whirlwind of parchment appears to have been unleashed in the chamber – the result of frantic efforts to pack and ‘loot’ as the Archonteans fled. Most of the parchment is useless, but there is a 1 in 6 chance per turn spent searching that something interesting might be unearthed. If an interesting result is indicated, roll on the following table to determine what is found (each may be found only once):

### 8-97: Zhorak’s Retreat and Resting Place

Secret Door: The door is difficult to locate (1 in 8) and opens only by inserting a rounded, 2”-diameter object into a hidden aperture near the floor. A suitable object would be a ring with a correctly-sized stone, such as Zhorak’s ring (see new magic items; currently in 8-115), although any similar object will work. Although the door can be propped open from the inside, it can only be opened from within if the true Zhorak’s ring (8-115) is used from within; otherwise, intruders will be trapped once the door closes in an hour.

The chamber is only 6’ tall and undecorated. Stone ledges 3’ tall run along the walls of the chamber. In the center is a sunken area, 10’ below the level of the floor. The sunken area contains a rope bed stretched across the west end of the area, plus a water barrel and a wooden chest. The ledges are scattered with scraps of metal, empty potion bottles, and unfinished projects. The true treasure of Zhorak, however, is Zhorak’s hammer (see new magic items); it rests on a special rack by the west wall.

A dwarven corpse, desiccated but not visibly damaged, rests on the rope bed. On the wall by the bed, in Dwarven Runic, is scrawled the phrase “Burn me!”. The corpse wears a finely carved seal matrix on a silver chain (50 gp) around its neck, and an elaborate copper-and-silver bracelet on its left wrist. These objects are the seal of Zhorak, which may be used to activate advanced features of the forge (8-100), and Zhorak’s bracelet (see new magic items), which allowed him to control his miners. The corpse is Zhorak, who was deceived in the early years (1701 AEP) of the War of Sortians and Theosophs (see World of Archontos appendix) 
by his assistant, Lozor Hornfels, and died slowly of starvation in his own sanctum. Zhorak’s spirit (see new monsters) haunts the place as a malign entity, eager to take vengeance on any of the living.

GM Note: Lozor Hornfels (see 8-115) smithed a replica of Zhorak’s ring in secrecy. He managed to switch the two rings, hoping to gain power or influence by possession of the ring. When Zhorak entered his sanctum using the false ring, he became trapped within. As no one else knew the location of the sanctum, Zhorak slowly died; Lozor, afraid of retribution, fled but was slain in the cavern of 8-115.

Zhorak, undead spirit (see new monsters): SZ M; AL NE; AC 1; MV 120’ flying (Class A); HD 9; HP 61; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12; MR 75%. Special attacks: energy drain; gaze instills hunger. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold and cold; cannot be turned while remains are intact.

Treasure:
Zhorak’s hammer (see new magic items); the seal of Zhorak (350 gp); Zhorak’s bracelet (see new magic items); a beautiful white and yellow gold ring with a 2” jade stone, i.e., the false ring of Zhorak (1,750 gp); assorted scraps of precious metal and stones (350 gp total); slippers of stealth (see new magic items); and Zhorak’s inert dwarven life-stone (see new magic items), which, due to his fame, would bring a reward of 10x its normal value if returned to Kazildor.

### 8-98: Zhorak’s Quarters

This chamber served as Zhorak’s private sanctum and living space. A patch of living mosaic (see new magic items) is set into the north wall; it is covered by a tattered bit of hanging cloth. This particular specimen is unusual, as it can call up images of most of the Archontean locations in the halls, provided the speaker issues commands in Dwarvish. It is possible to ‘zoom’ in on the mosaic by saying ‘closer’ in Dwarvish. The following table summarizes areas that may be viewed: 

Level Viewable Areas

Sub-Level 8 Only areas SL8-16 to SL8-24

The east wall features a fresco depicting an underground grotto – with pools, stalagmites, stalactites, flowstone in various colors, and so forth. An expert spelunker or dwarf will notice subtle touches of carving and shaping of the features of the grotto; in fact, the fresco is a scene from the famous (to dwarves) Grotto of Contemplation in Kazildor (see World of Archontos appendix). Dwarven PCs from that center of dwarven culture will recognize it immediately; others may just see the fresco as a dim, somewhat inert cavern-scape. Detect magic reveals that the fresco is enchanted. Those who know the command word (“Home” in Dwarvish) can use the fresco to travel directly to the Grotto by literally stepping into the 
scene. Knowledge of the command word was limited to Zhorak himself; short of random guessing, the word can only be revealed by powerful planar or divine magic.

Other than these features, the chamber is mundane. Furniture includes a bed frame, an armoire, a scroll case, a low table and three dwarf-sized chairs, all exquisitely made out of teak (2,500 gp for the lot). Long strips of torn bedclothes litter the area, and almost all personal items were looted in antiquity. Careful inspection of the table reveals a hidden compartment cleverly concealed on its underside. Inside the compartment is a square of parchment that reveals Zhorak’s doubts about his 2nd Tapper, Lozor Hornfels. It reads, in Dwarvish: “In case of my disappearance, Second Tapper Hornfels will undoubtedly be found to be responsible. He has been sniffing about my secrets for too long now. The color of his stone is off. As yet he does not know of my sanctum. Seek it to the southwest, and bring the true ring.” It is signed with the distinctive seal of Zhorak. The note refers to area 8-97, and to Zhorak’s (correct) suspicions that Lozor would betray him. Lozor’s body may be found at 8-115.

### 8-99: Gallery of Goods

This 12’-tall, barrel-arched hallway was used to display Zhorak’s finished items for visiting dignitaries. The floor is red marble. The walls are lined with 4’-tall ledges sheathed in blue marble. The ceiling was painted yellow, but most of the paint is flaking off in large strips. For obvious reasons, none of Zhorak’s goods remain, with one exception: his enchanted blade, feather (see new magic items). It lies in a pile of paint flakes on the east ledge, waiting for 
someone to speak the command word that activates it from super-heavy to ‘light as a feather’.

Treasure:
The magic sword, feather (see new magic items).

### 8-100: The Forge of Zhorak

The legendary forge of Zhorak is found in this tall (30’) chamber. The walls are sheathed in red granite up to 20’ in height, while the domed ceiling is covered in white marble tiles. A continual light spell cast at the peak of the dome provides light. Colossal (18’ tall) statues of dwarven smiths flank both the eastern and western exits. The dwarves carry the same tools as the statues in area 8-95 (hammer, tongs, fuller and swage) and are carved such that they stare at the forge proper. The north wall carries a colossal carved face of a dwarf, one that visitors always assumed to be in the likeness of Zhorak himself.

The center of the chamber holds the elements of the forge: an x-shaped stone basin with rancid water, two anvils, a bellows, a bin containing a pile of lava rocks, and a glowing, white-hot forge. 

Ten dwarves currently occupy the chamber. They are dressed in chain mail and carry weapons, and are busy inspecting the forge apparatus (although they do not appear to be operating it). See below for their reactions to visitors. GM Note: the dwarves are actually doppelgangers, a strike-force of special operatives taking part in the Endless War between dwarves and doppelgangers.

A pair of fresh corpses of human adventurers are piled against the northeast wall. They have been slain by weapons, and still bear some of their equipment.

Using the Forge: Basics

The solid elements of the forge – the basin and forge itself – are constructed of blocks of red granite, 3’ tall and carved with geometric forms and Dwarven Runes. A helmeted dwarven face is carved on the north side of the forge, with its mouth open in a round ‘o’ about 6” in diameter. 

The interior of the forge consists of a steel tray set into the granite. Scores of lava rocks litter the tray. Both tray and rocks are red hot with heat. Close inspection reveals that the tray is hinged, and could probably be opened downward once the mechanism were discovered. Inflicting 25 HP of damage on the tray will break it, spilling the rocks into the larger cavity below, a cavity in which a huge fire elemental has been imprisoned for millennia. Breaking 
the tray releases the fire elemental, which will attack furiously for 3-6 rounds before departing to the elemental plane of fire. 

In its base configuration (closed tray with lava rocks), the forge is eminently usable, provided suitable tools and materials are located (e.g., those in 8-101) and the water in the basin replaced. 

But to achieve more potent effects such as those for which Zhorak was famous, it is necessary to access the inner workings of the forge. To do so, one must procure Zhorak’s seal (8-97) and place it in the open mouth carved on the north side of the forge. Doing so causes the metal grate to fall open, revealing a deeper forge fueled by the fire elemental. Placing any other object in the open mouth activates the iron golem at 8-100A, which crashes through the wall to defend the forge. 

Using the Forge: Special Properties

What follows are special rules that modify and in some cases replace the standard rules for enchanting objects. Regular metallic equipment and jewelry may be imbued with magical effects in one of two ways. The first is for a competent smith to locate Zhorak’s hammer (see new magic items; currently in 8-97), a potent magical item that allows the smith to impart certain spell effects into his craft. It should be noted that, while slightly more limiting in terms of possible magical effects, this method is far easier and was, in fact, how Zhorak himself operated. Method one requires the following: arcanum (see new magic items), Zhorak’s hammer, and the appropriate items to be enchanted. The time needed for enchanting is a minimum of a week per effect (or plus). Any effects created with Zhorak’s hammer are permanent. Each effect requires a certain amount of arcanum be added to the forge during the smithing process. Finally, the materials to be enchanted must be of the highest quality, and the smith must be above average in skill; those with no smithing experience will fail dismally. For the effects that may be enchanted, as well as the accompanying arcanum cost, see the write-up of Zhorak’s hammer in the new magic items section.

The second method is more laborious, costly, and time-consuming, but allows a wider variety of magical effects to be enchanted. For method two, a smith and a magic user of at least 12th level (or a smith who is also a magic user of that level) must work together over the forge. The pair must possess the following: an object to be enchanted, arcanum, the spell enchant an item, the spell(s) appropriate to the effect to be created, and other 
ingredients worth 250 gp per level of spell to be created. This method requires substantial amounts of arcanum: 10 lb per spell level or plus to be created (e.g., 10 lb for a dagger +1; 20 lb for a detect evil ring, etc.). The time required for enchantment is two weeks per plus or equivalent spell level. Of course, to create permanent items the magic user must be higher level and have access to the 8th-level spell, permanency. 

It is possible to combine methods one and two, that is, for a smith to use Zhorak’s hammer in conjunction with a magic user of appropriate level. In so doing, one can create a wider array of effects than those native to the hammer itself, but at a faster and cheaper rate than if the hammer were not used. The cost and time for enchantment is halved when the hammer is used during method two.

The Doppelgangers

Ljots, a doppelgangers of exceptional power and intelligence, leads the expedition. His mission was to locate the forge of Zhorak, loot it of any valuables and intelligence usable in the Endless War, and then destroy it. The team has been operating in Arden Vul for 
many months, but only recently managed to ambush a dwarven party with a map to area 8-7; they have just used the teleportal there to access the forge. They have scouted areas 8-95 to 8-96 and 8-98 to 8-104, but have not (yet) entered the mines (8-94). Neither have they located areas 8-97 or 8-100A. While Ljots is content with his success in finding the forge, the other members of the team are growing restive, as they have become worried about how they will escape from the forge once their mission is completed. Ljots is unaware that other doppelgangers have infiltrated the Guild of Service (see 4-10).

The shape-changers are not necessarily hostile when encountering PCs. Ljots introduces himself as Arkose Scoria, a member of the famous clan Scoria. He speaks good Dwarvish and the common trade argot, but little Archontean; he apologizes that his brothers are nervous around non-dwarfs and thus probably won’t reply to questions. His cover story is that he has been sent by the Pyrite Council of Kazildor to locate Zhorak’s old forge and, hopefully, 
his remains; ‘Arkose’ is also to evaluate the risks and rewards for establishing a new dwarven colony in Arden Vul. He explains that the human corpses are of bandits who tried to prevent the ‘dwarves’ from reoccupying what should be dwarven property.

Ljots wears a silver chain around his neck of the sort typical for a dwarven life-stone (see new magic items), but if it were possible to look at the stone (and it is a serious cultural insult to ask to see a dwarf ’s life-stone), it would instantly be apparent that the stone is inert and thus not connected to the life force of Arkose/Ljots. Three of the other doppelgangers speak Dwarvish and wear similarly inert life-stones tucked into their shirts. The other six speak no Dwarvish and have no life-stones.

If an adventuring party has no dwarves in it, Ljots and his companions will be much more at ease, as they feel confident their disguises are sufficient to fool non-dwarves. In such cases, the doppelgangers may share food and swap stories and maps with the PCs, hoping that the PCs will locate an exit from the area. Only if a non-dwarven party is aggressive or exceptionally stupid (like sleeping without guards) will the doppelgangers attack. If a party 
contains dwarven PCs, however, Ljots and his band will become visibly nervous the longer the PCs stay in the area. A dwarven PC has a base 10% chance of noticing some incorrect detail of their speech or disguises; this chance rises by 5% for every hour the PCs spend with the shapeshifters. The base chance is also modified as follows: +25% to base if PCs somehow learn that a number of the ‘dwarves’ speak no Dwarvish; +75% to base if a PC manages to glimpse one of the inert life-stones; +50% to base if a PC is familiar with the Scoria clan, and +100% if a dwarven PC is a member of that clan. Once the doppelgangers think that the PCs 
are beginning to grow suspicious, they attack viciously. If combat of any sort breaks out, Ljots uses his potions of rock melting (see new magic items) on the forge, thus unwittingly causing the iron golem (8-100A) to activate.

The Iron Golem (8-100A)
Zhorak created the iron golem as the main defender of his forge. It waits behind the stone wall at 8-100A until circumstances cause it to activate and burst through the wall. See 8-100A for details.

The Forge after Initial Encounters
If the PCs never discover the nature of Ljots and his fellows and depart in peace, then Ljots will eventually accomplish his mission and destroy the forge. Subsequent visits will find the forge wrecked and cold; substantial scorch marks (from the fire elemental) will be visible all over the area, and the corpses of eight doppelgangers will be scattered about the floor (torn apart by the iron golem). In such cases the iron golem will be ready and waiting to smite any 
new desecrators.

1 fire elemental: SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 16; HP 114; #AT 1; Dmg 3-24. Special attacks: combustion. Special defenses: +2 weapons or better to hit.

Ljots, aka Arkose Scoria, more powerful doppelganger: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 52; #AT 1; Dmg 7-14 (battle axe +2) or 3-6 (light crossbow +2). Special attacks: surprise 4 
in 6. Special defenses: immune to charm and sleep; saves as a 10th-level fighter. Special: ESP. Possessions: dwarven-sized chain mail +2; helm of comprehend languages; a handy haversack; 4 potions of rock melting (see new magic items); a light crossbow +2 and 20 bolts; and a battle axe +2. Due to his natural doppelganger strength, he attacks with weapons like a human with STR 18/76 (i.e., +2 to hit, and +4 damage); these bonuses stack with the magic of his weapons.

9 doppelgangers: SZ M; AL N; AC 5 or see below; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 25, 24, 23, 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12 or see below. Special attacks: surprise 4 in 6. Special defenses: immune to charm and sleep; saves as a 10th-level fighter. Special: ESP. The three toughest doppelgangers wear dwarven-sized chain mail, giving them AC 4; these three also carry war hammers +1 (6-9 damage). Due to their natural strength, they are +2 to hit and +3 to damage with weapons (bonuses stack with the magic of the weapons). The other doppelgangers fight as regular instances of their race.

Treasure:
On the human corpses: studded leather armor +1, a suit of chain mail, a spear +1, a two-handed sword +1 with the name ‘Rex’ inscribed on the blade, and a large shield +1, missile deflector.

In a special pouch tied to Ljots’s belt: 4 potions of rock melting (see new magic items). He intends to use these four to destroy the forge.

On the doppelgangers, in addition to the worn equipment listed above: four inert dwarven life-stones (see new magic items), which could be returned to Kazildor for important favors; 3,472 sp; 3,954 gp; a coral statuette of a cephalopod, with quartz eyes (275 gp); a square of platinum stamped on both sides with the name ‘Ljots’ and yin-yang symbol (75 gp); 3 coils of silk rope; rations suitable for feeding ten persons for a week; two potions of poison; a potion of diminution; and six vials of concentrated acid.

They also have the map they used to locate Zhorak’s Forge: a rec-tangular piece of copper inscribed with an image (the map) and a set of Dwarven runes. The runes state: ‘Lord Zhorak 
made his home near the bottom of the chasm. Find the hall with the six basalt columns, then use the appropriate red circle.’ The image shows two rows of four circles each; the third circle in the top row has an ‘x’ scratched through it. [GM Note: the map refers, of course, to area 8-7, with its six pillars and eight teleportals. It correctly indicates the proper teleporter for Zhorak’s Forge (8-7C)]. 

### 8-100a: Iron Golem

Behind the northern wall of 8-100 stands a terrible iron golem, the creation of Zhorak the smith. The golem is a bit smaller than the ‘usual’ golem (10’ instead of 12’), but if anything is better built than most. The golem appears as an armored, trim-bearded dwarf with runes incised on its back and a grim, unsmiling face. The runes read ‘Zhorak’ and ‘Vengeance’. The golem carries a huge, two-handed stone hammer. It is inert until one of two circumstances occur: 1) if anything other than Zhorak’s seal is inserted into the open mouth carved on the north side of the forge in 8-100; or 2) if damage is inflicted on any of the sculptural elements of area 8-100 (i.e., the carved dwarven statues) or the forge itself (including breaking the steel tray – see above), whether intentionally or not. In either case, the golem activates, bursting through the south wall to smite the intruders.

1 iron golem: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 18; HP 80; #AT 1; Dmg 4-40. Special attacks: poison gas. Special defenses: +3 or better weapons to hit; immune to all magic except electricity, which slows it; healed by fire.

### 8-101: Forge Materials

Zhorak used this chamber to store basic materials for the forge. Much remains: 40 5-lb ingots of iron (5 cp per bar), 25 5-lb ingots of steel (5 sp per bar), 20 5-lb ingots of silver (250 sp per bar), and 2 5-lb ingots of gold (250 gp per bar). There is also a large, but very heavy (100 lb), spool of silver thread (250 gp) and a similar spool of solder (250 cp).

### 8-102: Teleport destination from 8-7c

A 6’-diameter circle of shiny lapis tile is set into the western ell of this intersection; those using the teleporter at 8-7C arrive on the lapis circle.

### 8-103: Vats

Two 4’-diameter, 4’-tall stone vats once used in metal preparations occupy this storage area. Two human skeletons are slumped against the vats, bereft of equipment. One of the vats contains 4” of water floating above oil; the other is filled with strong acid. A very large gray ooze waits on the ceiling for other victims; it (and not the acid) ate all of the equipment of these treasure hunters.

1 gray ooze: SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 10’; HD 3+3; HP 23; #AT 1; Dmg 2-16. Special attacks: corrode metal. Special defenses: impervious to spells; immune to heat and cold. 

### 8-104: Arcanum Mother Lode

This chamber holds one of the largest pieces of arcanum (see new magic items) discovered in Arden Vul, and is the reason why Zhorak built his forge in this location. The door to the chamber is locked, with the key lost long ago. The chamber within is hemispherical and approximately 40’ in diameter. The east end is dominated by an enormous pulsating orange rock, the arcanum source. A finely made set of chisels and hammers lie on the floor by the arcanum. Approximately 900 lb of usable arcanum may be harvested here. Of course, the usual side-effects for magic users are applicable.

## Level 8: 105 - 120

### 8-105: Trapped Cube

Trapped within the corridor fragment is a large and very hungry gelatinous cube. It prefers to wait immediately behind the door frame, hoping that incautious prey will step through the door and into its body. A pile of gold coins lies on the floor beyond the cube.

1 extra-large gelatinous cube: SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 39; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks; paralysis; surprise on 1-3. Special defenses: partial immunity to cold; immune to electricity, fear, hold, paralyzation, polymorph, and sleep.

Treasure:
33 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items).

### 8-106: Almost Empty Chamber

The walls of this former guardroom are covered with poorly-executed images of Archontean legionaries marching, advancing in line, and carousing. A 3’ layer of trash litters the floor and rises against the walls on all sides, with the important exception of a 10’-diameter circle in the exact center of the chamber. This circle is completely clean of dust and debris, except for a dwarf-sized skeleton that appears to be reaching for the object in the center of the circle. 

That object is a cylinder, about 6” in diameter and 18” tall, made of a yellow metallic substance. A red light blinks on the top face of the cylinder.

Despite the ominous impressions given by the cylinder, it is nothing more than a rudishva dust ionizer (see new technological items), a device that keeps 10’-diameter areas clean of dust. How the dust ionizer came to be present here is unknown. The skeleton is without equipment.

Secret Door (east): The door is normal to find and opens by pushing inwards with brute force.

### 8-107: Tomb of Sulla Bellator

The door to this area is locked. Within is the tomb of Sulla, nicknamed ‘the Battler’ (or Bellator), a famous Archontean military commander from antiquity.

The entrance hallway is covered on wall and ceiling by quarter-round reliefs showing an Archontean polemarch personally leading legionaries against goblins, varumani, and heqeti. The commander wears an archaic hair style, with tight, neck-length ringlets. He wields a battle axe in one hand, and displays his baculus of authority in the other.

The tomb proper is 20’ tall and dominated by impressive sculpture. A life-sized statue of Sulla Bellator stands against the west wall. Sulla stares with a half-smile and open eyes. Strangely, although his face and bottom inch of his hair are finely carved, the rest of his head is smooth, as if the sculptor did not finish his work or did not intend for it to be seen. The same is true of the body, which aside from the hands and shoes lacks any detail. 

An inscription in Mithric is carved on the wall to the right and left of the statue; it reads: “Sulla Bellator, fiercest of the fierce, bravest of the brave, who always led from the front. Beloved by his men, admired by the archons, he gave his image and spirit to the Myrmex.” [GM: the inscription refers to the fact that Zhorak modelled the infamous Myrmex – see SL6-22 – on Sulla.]

The north and south walls feature more of the quarter-round sculptures seen in the entrance hall.

The center of the chamber is dominated by a 15’-square platform. Four 8’-tall stone legionaries point their spears towards the center, where Sulla’s sarcophagus rests. The spearmen are Archontean animated constructs (see new monsters), who animate only under the circumstances listed below. 

The sarcophagus is simple black basalt, with the Mithric inscription ‘Sulla’ and an image of a battle axe. Resting on the sarcophagus are a polemarch’s helmet and cuirass, along with legionary greaves and arm guards. The workmanship of each piece is exceptional, and none of the set shows sign of rust or decay. In fact, the set is magical, the fabled armor of Sulla (see new magic items). Although a seam runs around the sarcophagus and thus appears to suggest that the lid is removable, this is a trick. Attempting to force open the ‘lid’ triggers the block trap and causes the animated spearmen to lurch into action. 

The only way to access the actual interior of the sarcophagus is to adorn the statue of Sulla on the west wall with his armor. Indeed, it is immediately apparent to those who bring the armor to the statue that the ‘unfinished’ portions of the statue are designed for the armor. Should the armor be placed on Sulla, the sarcophagus will grind to the north, revealing a shallow compartment. Inside the compartment are Sulla’s bones, plus his baculus of authority, a sunburst medallion of gold and platinum, and Sulla’s battle axe (see new magic items). Unfortunately for looters, adorning the statue properly also causes the statue of Sulla to animate as an imperial stone guardian (see new monsters). Once “Sulla” has been defeated, the armor and other loot are free for the taking.

Trap (stone block): Attempting to remove the lid of Sulla’s sarcophagus causes a rectangular stone block to drop from the ceiling in the entrance hallway. The block grinds downward, destroying the carvings on the walls and leaving only an 8” gap between the top of the block and the ceiling. The trap is normal to detect, but impossible to disarm.

6 Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 45, 40, 38, 37, 35, 33; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.

Sulla, the imperial stone guardian: (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 64; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

Treasure:
The armor of Sulla (see new magic items); Sulla’s battle axe (see new magic items); an archaic polemarch’s baculus, in ebony with silver chasings (1,550 gp to a collector); and a sunburst medallion in gold and platinum with the Archontean numeral ‘5’ (a ‘V’) set out in small rubies (4,500 gp). The medallion was given to Sulla to commemorate his command of the V Scutarii legion.

### 8-108: Blue Haze Lichen

This cavern is covered with a patch of psychotropic pale-blue lichen known as “blue haze” (see new flora). The lichen covers all the walls, floor and ceiling of this cave.

Secret Door (to 8-106): The door is easy to spot from this side (1 in 4), but must be pulled inward to open.

### 8-109: Cave with Pool

The center 20’x20’ section of this cavern is filled with 15’ of crystal clear water that has dripped from the walls over the ages. A skeleton in rotted leather armor can be glimpsed at the bottom of the pool. A strange, translucent ochre jelly floats atop the pool, ready to devour any who swim for the skeleton.

1 translucent ochre jelly: SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 30’; HD 6; HP 39; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special defenses: lightning divides into half-sized creatures.

Treasure:
Next to the dead adventurer at the bottom of the pool is a battered steel box containing four 100 gp pearls.

### 8-110: Tunnel down to 9-150

This tunnel corkscrews downward until it debouches at area 9-150.

### 8-111: Memory Trap

The floor of this large cavern is pitted with uneven dips and hummocks. Remnants of worked stone floor slabs are evident by the northwest exit. Seven stone figurines hang from strings in the northeastern section of the chamber; each figurine is about 18” tall, with arms and legs twined about an unrealistically-large, gaping mouth. They are painted bright primary colors. Approaching within 15’ of any of the figurines triggers a nasty magical trap (see below) that is set and maintained by the rakshasas nearby (see 8-125). 

Trap (memory loss): Anyone approaching within 15’ of any of the seven figurines must save vs. spells or have his/her memories erased. The trap is detectable as normal, but cannot be disarmed short of magical means (e.g., dispel magic by a 9th-level or greater spell caster). The trap causes the memories to be transferred to one of the empty vessels found in the rakshasas’ ‘trophy room’ (8-126). Each figurine can only erase one being’s memories before 
becoming inert; six of the figurines are still ‘charged’. Memories that are erased include the victim’s name, life story, friends, recent events, and so forth; anything considered to be ‘passive’ memory, such as language and knowledge of skills (including) combat, is not affected. A magic user affected by this trap thus would be able to memorize spells as usual, provided someone explained the process to him/her. Should PCs attempt to destroy the figurines from a distance with missiles or spells, they find that the figurines are immune to most attacks; only dispel magic (as stated above) is effective. Memories erased by a figurine can be restored by destroying the appropriate vessel in the trophy room. After three weeks, the rakshasas will have recharged any ‘used’ figurines and/or replaced any that have gone missing.

Secret Door (northeast): The door is normal to detect, and opens in one of two ways: either a rakshasa tooth must be inserted into a hidden hole, or a successful lift gates roll must be made to force it open.

GM Note: Most victims of the memory erasing trap end up as food for the rakshasas in 8-125, but a few manage to stumble away to other parts of Arden Vul. Four such victims are Hakreon (currently at 7-76), Kormak (currently at 8-132), Justine Two-Hands (currently at 9-130), and Niskim the goblin (8-114). The GM may wish to include other wanderers who have lost their memory. Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

### 8-112: Paranoid Adventurers

This strange worked chamber is protected by two locked steel doors with closable eye-slits. Inside are two adventurers who have lost their minds in the bliss pollen. The pair has holed up inside the chamber, fearful of the imaginary threats they perceive without. They talk furtively to any visitor through the eye-slit in either door before inevitably freaking out in a loud and possibly violent tantrum. Any conversation prior to the freakout is likely to be 
paranoid and weird. If the adventurers are somehow subdued and allowed to recuperate in a safe environment for 3-6 weeks, they are grateful to their rescuers and offer information about their route into the Halls. 

They entered at the pyramid (3-1), descended via 3-7 to the goblin caves on Level 5 (3-44A to 3-48), passed across the sundered span (5-35), descended the troll lift at 5-54 to Level 6 
(6-1), journeyed to the Arena (6-58 to 6-86) where they witnessed some bouts, descended to Level 7 (via 6-64 to 7-42), and located the tunnel at area 7-40 that led them to Level 8 (8-137). They can describe all these areas accurately, and can give useful advice on dealing with the neutral factions found en route. Their advice concerning Level 8 is a bit hazier: they descended the cliff at 8-137, paid tribute to the varumani at 8-136, and then wandered north, where the pollen took them. Their comrades are gone. In addition to this valuable information, the pair might be willing to join an appropriately aligned party.

If and when the chamber is eventually accessed, PCs will find it foul-smelling and devoid of much interest. A waste bucket, a small keg of water, a cold fire pit and two bedrolls constitute the entirety of the furnishings. In his madness Laertes has scrawled numerous cryptic phrases on the walls in Archontean. A sampling include: “They come! They come? Who are they? Latch the gate and do not let them in. The dwarf changes his shape – do not trust it!”

Keller, nicknamed ‘Killer Keller’, 6th-level male Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL CN; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 59; #AT 1; Dmg 3-8 (spear +1), 1-6 (long bow). Abilities: STR 16, INT 
8, WIS 8, DEX 10, CON 16, CHA 14. Possessions: chain mail +1 and shield +1; spear +1; long bow with 20 arrows; a pouch with 339 sp and 128 gp; a potion of healing.

Laertes the Lithe, 6th-level male Archontean magic user: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 18; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (staff +1). Abilities: STR 8, INT 16, WIS 7, DEX 15, CON 11, CHA 9. 
Possessions: bracers of defense (AC 6); staff +1; wand of magic missiles (21 charges); a sack of gold dust (375 gp); a purse with 251 sp and 37 gp; a potion of explosive acid and a potion of deafening light (see new magic items for both). Spells memorized: burning hands, charm person, hold portal, sleep; detect invisibility, stinking cloud; fireball, hold person.

Laertes’s Spell book: Burning hands, charm person, detect magic, friends, grease, hold portal, magic missile, sleep, spider climb, write; detect invisibility, ESP, levitate, locate object, rope trick, stinking cloud; dispel magic, fireball, hold person, lightning bolt, secret page, slow.

### 8-113: Ledge

This ledge is 40’ above the floor of the cavern of the bliss flowers (8-67), and provides access to other parts of the level. It is littered with the husks of dead giant bees.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

### 8-114: Confused Goblin

Niskim, the goblin commander of a failed expedition sent by Weskenim (SL4-22) to locate the fabled scepter of the goblins (see new magic items), wanders about here in a daze. In addition to having been affected by the bliss pollen, Niskim has had her memories erased by one of the figurines in 8-111. She is unable to provide any information about herself, her mission, or how/why she happens to be present in this cavern.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

Niskim, goblin sub-chief (as a hobgoblin): SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 1+1; HP 7; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8 (long sword). Possessions: long sword. She carries a pouch with six pieces of 
jasper (50 gp each) and a piece of dried human skin on which is drawn a crude sketch of a scepter along with the words “Find this!” in goblin. The sketch reflects the goblin court’s best guess as to what the scepter looks like, and bears little resemblance to the actual object, which may currently be found at 8-69.

### 8-115: Dead End with Skeleton

The skeleton of a dwarf lies crushed under a large piece of stone in the northeast extension. This is Lozor Hornfels, 2nd Tapper under Zhorak the Smith (see 8-97). Lozor fled the forge area in antiquity but got lost in the pollen haze and was killed in a freak accident here. He carries the true ring of Zhorak (see new magic items), which he stole from Zhorak and which is necessary to open the secret door to 8-97.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

Treasure: 
The ring of Zhorak (see new magic items); Lozor’s inert dwarven life-stone (see new magic items).

### 8-116: Knights’ Rest

Secret Doors (north and east): The stone doors are identical. They are normal to find, but difficult to open. The doors only open after a 1”-diameter object is inserted into a small hole in the ceiling; the holes are perfectly sized for the tip of a sun lance carried by a Sun-Scarred Knight (see new monsters). Of course, destructive magic or a successful lift gates roll will also open either door.

The chamber was claimed by the Sun-Scarred Knights as a safe house in which wandering knights could rest, recuperate, and resupply. Two thick, plush carpets, one with geometric patterns and the other displaying an octagonal tower rising out of a cavern (a representation of SL10A-14), cover the floor. Two hammocks slung in the corners, two simple wooden chairs, a low table, a water keg, a tripod of heating (see new magic items), and an unlocked wooden chest complete the furnishings. 

The chest contains dried rations suitable for one person for four weeks, 500 gp (several hundred years old, but not yet ‘ancient’), 10 ancient octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items), a silk pouch with seven carnelians (50 gp each), twenty flasks of oil, a tinder box, a hammer, a scribe’s case with ink and parchment, and three well-worn codices bound in blue leather. The titles of the codices are: the Secret Courtship of Julius the Exarch, The Thirty-seven Quips of Balak the Sage, and the Lives of the Noble Founders, Arden and Vul (see appendix of Arden Vul books).

The Sun-Scarred Knight, Sir Discord, along with his varlet, Rorgo, are currently resting here (see new monsters). Sir Discord is one of the few knights who cares little for those he encounters while on his missions; he is just as likely to attack and overcome those in his path as he is to converse with them. Should PCs penetrate this chamber while Discord is still present, he will certainly take it as an offense and will attack with all his resources. If Discord and Rorgo have already been encountered at 8-117 (see text there), they will not be present here.

Sir Discord’s mission is to locate the scepter of the goblins (see new magic items). To this end he has cultivated the fantasies of the goblin mystic, Gislu (4-2). In so doing he has annoyed his colleague, Sir Sorrow (SL4-19), who is attempting to prop up the powers of the goblin king. Discord and Rorgo are hunting for the scepter (found at 8-69), which they rightly believe to be in the Nether Reaches.

Sir Discord, the Sun-Scarred Knight (see new monsters), 11th-level male Wiskin fighter: SZ M; AL LE; AC -2; MV 120’; HD 11; HP 97; #AT 3/2; Dmg 7-13 (bastard sword +2), or 4-7 (dagger), or 3-6 (light crossbow and bolts +2). Abilities: STR 18/25, INT 9, WIS 11, DEX 10, CON 17, CHA 12. Possessions: key to SL10A-16, gothic armor and sun lance (see new technological items); solar ring, circlet of command, and backpack of capacity (see new magic items for all three); bastard sword +2; dagger, light crossbow and 20 bolts +2; a purse with 77 sp, 61 gp, and 111 ancient copper bits (see Arden Vul items). 

Rorgo, varlet to Sir Discord, and a 5th-level male Thorcin fighter: SZ M; AL CN; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 5; HP 48; #AT 1; Dmg 6-13 (long sword +2) or 1-6 (short bow). Abilities: STR 
18/47, INT 11, WIS 10, DEX 12, CON 16, CHA 14. Possessions: chain mail +2 and shield; long sword +2; short bow with 18 arrows; 2 potions of heroism.

### 8-117: Wet Cave

This cave drips with moisture. For every two turns spent here, there is a 20% (noncumulative) chance that Sir Discord and Rorgo will emerge into the cave from the secret door to 8-116. In such circumstances, Discord takes lethal action immediately in order to preserve the secret location of the knights’ rest hall. Discord will pursue to the death those who flee from him.

20% chance every two turns for Sir Discord and Rorgo (see stats at 8-116).

### 8-118: Table Rock Cave

A 15’-diameter rock formation in the center of this cave is flattened and resembles a round table. On it rest three tarnished silver cups, upside down (20 gp each). One cup pins a note to the rock: “Discord – return to the Citadel at once. The Master needs you.” It is sealed with an image of a sunburst. 

GM Note: The note refers to Sir Discord, currently in 8-116; the Master is Malachite, aka the leader of the Sun-Scarred Knights SL10A-32).

### 8-118a: Trap! Hole in the Floor

To the east of the large cave at 8-118 is a jagged, 6’-diameter hole in the tunnel floor. It leads through 3’ of rock, through the ceiling of area 8-124, and then drops 10’ to the floor. Due to the light and uneven conditions of the tunnel, the hole should be treated as a pit 
trap, albeit with a bonus for discovery (+10% to detect traps). Those falling through the hole take 2-7 HP damage, and are immediately confronted by the denizens of 8-124.

### 8-119: Temple of Besa: Entrance

The original entrance to the Archontean temple of Besa is found here. Although one of the Twelve and hence an official deity of the ancient Archonteans, Besa’s portfolio – potency, pleasure, violence and hedonism – ensured that worship of the Sloe-Eyed Lady would be relegated to hidden and often secret locations within the empire. In Arden Vul, her temple was located deep within the Nether Reaches, accessible to those who knew where to look but suitably removed from the more proper grand temples of Thoth and Set.

The entrance hall gives a taste of what is to come: three pillars carved with scenes of the grinning goddess alternating between acts of love and acts of violence, and walls featuring badly worn frescoes depict cavorting men and women, the women voluptuous and the men priapic. Their activities include both pleasure and pain. 

An invisible glyph is inscribed on the west wall; it is instantly apparent to illusionists, but invisible to all others. The glyph simply states, in Archontean, “Danger.” The existence of the glyph is revealed by detect magic, although non-illusionists who attempt to render it visible (by spells such as detect illusion or true seeing) must save vs spells or suffer confusion for 2-8 turns. 

To the east is a niche containing a 5’-diameter circle of rose quartz set in the floor. This is the destination point for the teleporter at 8-7D.

A tunnel carved out of the ruined corridor leads downward to Level 9 (9-147).

The curved hallways leading downward to area 8-120 feature more of the same frescoes – voluptuous and priapic young men and women engaged in a variety of unusual acts. Despite the fading to the wall art, the floor is clear of dust and debris.

### 8-120: Temple of Besa: Main Temple 

The site of many debaucheries in antiquity, the main temple of Besa is currently quiet, if remarkably well preserved. Soft red light emerges from sconces set into the walls, illuminating the boudoir-like qualities of the temple. Eight slim columns rise to the 20’ ceiling; they are carved like the pillars at 8-119, with erotic images. 

Between the pillars is a sunken area, from which arises the cult statue of Besa. The floor around the pillars is covered with thick, plush red carpeting. Low platforms covered with red silk sheets and red pillows occupy the north, east and west points of the chamber. In these three locations, tapestries hang behind the platforms: one shows a surprisingly modest version of the well-known tale, the Ravishing of Besa; a second depicts Besa presiding over a scene of torture; and the third depicts a number of naked men writhing on imperial impaling spikes. The remainder of the walls display a mix of erotic and violent frescoes. Doors are concealed behind the east and west tapestries.

A rudishva, clad in an orange jumpsuit, is busily taking rubbings of the pillar carvings on a large piece of parchment. He introduces himself casually in accented Archontean as “Vatapi, 
one of the few survivors of the crash.” Vatapi is not aggressive, and seems content to negotiate and converse with visitors. If treated well, he chats happily and may invite visitors to meet his fellow survivor, Tataka, for a meal (in 8-124). If treated in a hostile manner, he responds with ‘hurt’ and disappointment before drinking his invisibility potion and attempting to join his friends in 8-125. 

Vatapi’s Story and Information: Vatapi reveals the following to friendly visitors: he and another rudishva lived throughout the Archontean era with the help of key technology that they had squirreled away. When the Archonteans abandoned Arden Vul, they sought a safe location far from the politics and warfare of the new factions. They found it here, in this ‘strange human temple dedicated to the pleasure/pain principles.’ Here they have lived 
in harmony for millennia, waiting rescue from the stars. Vatapi can provide the following information: he knows the forge of Zhorak is nearby, to the northwest; he knows of the bliss pollen and its effects (8-69), and might be willing to trade some rudishva breathing technology to the PCs in return for ‘stories of adventure’; several groups of goblins have come through, looking for a scepter, but Vatapi had to disappoint them, and they left via the tunnel at 8-119; he knows of two other rudishva survivors, the Lord of the Arena (6-85) and Psalor-Ki (5-75), although Vatapi considers both of them to be insane criminals; the occasional wandering monster appears in their domain, having unwittingly used the teleporter at 8-7, but Vatapi and his companion have been able to defeat or repel them all. 

Vatapi’s True Nature and Agenda: In fact, Vatapi is the leader of a trio of rakshasas that has occupied this area for many hundreds of years. He uses his illusion powers to appear as a rudishva and to make the ancient temple appear to be fresh and clean. Vatapi’s real plan, however, is to lower the PCs’ inhibitions, invite them to share a meal with him in area 8-124 (allegedly so the ‘rudishva’ can learn about the PCs’ adventures), and then launch a surprise attack.

Statue of Besa: This impressive statue is 17’ tall and composed of ivory with accents in colored stone and other natural materials. It depicts Besa, the Sloe-Eyed Lady, in the midst of her famous erotic dance. She is naked, with arms upraised, and long black hair whirled around her body (the hair is actual human hair affixed cleverly to the ivory). Her face is strangely impersonal, almost like a kouros, with almond eyes and a fixed, grinning mouth. 

Despite the long habitation of the rakshasas in this region, the spirit of Besa still inhabits her statue. Touching either of her breasts conveys a magical blessing, and those who engage in vigorous sexual or violent behavior in the statue’s presence have a 5% chance per day (and per act) to open a direct channel to Besa herself. The blessing takes the form of increased attractiveness to objects of desire for a month; practically, this adds +50% to reaction rolls 
when the blessed person encounters those he/she finds attractive. The direct channel to Besa can result in one of four ‘gifts’. Each gift comes with a side-effect. Besa can only appear directly once per month, regardless of how many petitioners seek to summon her.

D4 Gift Side Effect

1

Magical Protection: petitioner receives spell immunity for 1-4 hours

Increased libido; petitioner must save vs. spells each time he/she encounters an attractive person. The side effect lasts for 1 month.

2

Information: Besa truthfully and fully answers three questions posed by the petitioner

Increased bloodthirstiness: petitioner must save vs spells or actively seek to bloodily dismember all enemies, regardless of risk. Effect lasts for a month.

3

Beauty: petitioner’s CHA is increased. For those with CHA 15 or above, the increase is +1; for 
those with CHA less than 15, the increase is +2. 

Loss of wisdom: petitioner’s WIS is reduced by two for a month.

4 A pure gift: Besa grants a wish to the petitioner

Geas: Besa imposes a geas on the petitioner, either to restore one of her temples here or elsewhere, to achieve 20 sexual conquests in two months, or to slaughter bloodily and publicly ten powerful foes (at GM’s wish) within four months. 

The statue is immensely valuable (20,000 gp), both in terms of materials and historical significance, but removing it from her shrine incurs Besa’s wrath. Among the punishments meted out to desecrators include a permanent lowering of CHA by 2, the permanent disappearance of libido, and a permanent reduction of -20% to all reaction rolls. Should desecrators realize the errors of their ways and restore the statue, the curses will be lifted. Otherwise only the highest level divine intervention or high level magic (e.g., a wish spell) can remove the curses.

Vatapi, the ‘rudishva’ (actually a rakshasa): SZ M; AL LE; AC -4; MV 150’; HD 7; HP 49; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/2-5. Special defenses: ESP; affected only by 8th-level spells or greater; 
immune to normal weapons; half damage from +1 and +2 weapons. Cleric spells: curse, light, fear. Magic user spells: charm person, jump, magic missile, sleep; audible glamer, darkness 15’ radius, mirror image; dispel magic, suggestion. Possessions: rudishva jump suit; rudishva breather (see new technological items); potion of invisibility; wand of frost (22 charges); and one half of a pair of amulets of return (see new magic items).

Treasure:
The statue of Besa (20,000 gp), removal of which bears heavy consequences as described above.

## Level 8: 121 - 135

### 8-121: Temple of Besa: Cubicles

The entrance to each of these five cubicles appears to be covered by a thick, luxurious black-velvet drape. Inside each cubicle is a 3’-tall stone platform strewn with red, yellow, and black silk pillows. In antiquity these cubicles served as private rooms for the depravities of the followers of Besa. The luxurious appearance of these cubicles is the product of an illusion cast and maintained by the rakshasas (see 8-120, 8-124, and 8-125). In reality, the drapes and pillows are rotting and tattered. 

### 8-122: Temple of Besa: Inner Fane

This area was the site of the most secret and perverse rituals of the inner cult of Besa. Five more cubicles line the north wall, each equipped with restraints, low beds, and luxurious black silken sheets and pillows. As with the neighboring cubicles, the luxurious appearance is the product of an illusion; in reality the sheets and pillows are tattered and decrepit.

Another invisible phrase is inscribed on the south wall; it is instantly apparent to illusionists, but invisible to all others. It states the following, in Archontean: ‘Flee now, lest the ghost of the priestess consume you!’ The existence of the glyph is revealed by detect magic, although non-illusionists who attempt to render it visible (by spells such as detect illusion or true seeing) must save vs spells or suffer confusion for 2-8 turns. 

A 70’-long freestanding wall runs across the center of the chamber, blocking sight of the cubicles. The floor south of the wall is sheathed in purple marble, while floor-length black velvet drapes conceal the niche containing the 10’-tall marble cult statue of Besa. The beauty of her naked body is slightly marred by the numerous cuts and bruises that cover her marble flesh, and by the fact that her left leg and right arm seem to have been carved as if they had been broken. Besa’s face shows a smile, but a grim, humorless smile. The whiteness of the marble has been marred by a strange glyph inscribed in a circle with black paint across her 
chest and abdomen. In her left hand, Besa clutches a gold djed amulet (see new magic items); it could be removed by breaking the statue’s hand or through a slow (2-4 turns) and careful process of jimmying it free.

The glyph is demonic in origin, and serves to deny spirits entrance to an object or location; the rakshasas have used it to prevent Besa from manifesting in her cult statue. Should the 
glyph be erased, through the use of holy water, and a ceremony of hallowing performed, Besa’s spirit will return to the statue within 1-100 hours. Once she has returned, the same effects found at 8-120 can be produced through the same actions.

The spirit of Besa’s last high priestess, a certain Bunefer, haunts the cubicles in the north part of the chamber as a spectre. The spectre attacks mortal intruders within 4-7 round of their arrival. It does not molest the rakshasas, however, for reasons explained below. Should the spirit of Besa be restored to her statue, Bunefer the spectre will be transformed into a wraith.

Bunefer’s Story: As the Archontean hegemony crumbled, Bunefer attempted to maintain the usual ceremonies of the temple. But the demand for pleasure and pain waned in the face of more pressing issues, and both worshippers and lesser priestesses drained away. When Bunefer sought permission from Besa to close the temple, even temporarily, the goddess was irate, and punished Bunefer by slaying her and raising her as a wraith. She haunted the temple for hundreds of years until the rakshasas arrived. Vatapi convinced the wraith that they could help Bunefer repair her relationship with Besa, and even hinted that Bunefer could be restored to life. 

The first step in this process, according to the duplicitous Vatapi, was to conduct rituals on the cult statue of Besa. This ritual, which banished Besa, increased Bunefer’s power by making her a spectre, but did not bring her back to life. The rakshasas have convinced 
the rather dim Bunefer that the devouring of a certain number of souls is necessary to accomplish her goals. Although they are clearly using her to attract prey, Bunefer is not smart enough to realize it; she continues to aid the rakshasas in the vain hope that this will abet her condition.

Bunefer, a spectre: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 7+3; HP 53; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis. In some circumstances, Bunefer will become a wraith: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 120’, 240’ flying (Class B); HD 5+3; HP 32; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

Treasure:
A djed amulet (see new magic items), in the left hand of the statue of Besa. The velvet curtain was ensorcelled in antiquity to prevent decay; it could be sold for 250 gp. 

### 8-123: Temple of Besa: Cubicles

These five cubicles are identical to those at 8-121, with drapes, pillows and low platforms. The furnishings appear luxurious, but are in fact the product of illusions produced by the rakshasas.

### 8-124: Temple of Besa: Common Room

A wooden trestle some 20’ in length table stands in the center of this chamber. Four 5’-long benches encircle it. The table groans with delicious, but exotic food set in simple wooden and copper serving vessels. There are spicy vegetable dishes, a succulent-smelling roast, cups of wine, and a quivering sweet pudding. The walls are decorated with ancient and faded frescoes showing naked diners at a feast enjoying both a variety of Archontean dishes and each other.

If Vatapi (8-120) has been encountered previously and the PCs are on neutral terms with him, then he will likely be present here, attempting to get the PCs to join him at the feast and trade stories. His cover story, as recounted at 8-120, is that he and his companion, Tataka, possess a rudishva food processor which allows them to live and dine well. If the PCs agree to dine with him and share stories, he begs a few rounds (1-6) to fetch his companion, Tataka, from their home. If the PCs somehow have not encountered Vatapi previously, have slain him, or have through their actions caused him to flee from 8-120, then the chamber appears empty of inhabitants (although the food is still present).

In fact, the food is far simpler than it appears, having been enhanced by the rakshasas’ illusion powers: the vegetable dishes are moldy mushrooms, the wine is water, and the desserts are lichen patched together with water and mud. 

But the true horror of the meal is the roast, for the meat is actually the body of Ilvala, the third of the rakshasas dwelling here. The rakshasas’ evil plan is to get visitors to consume the 
apparently innocuous meat, not knowing that it is in fact the temporarily dismembered body of their comrade. Once Ilvala has been consumed, Vatapi can magically reconstitute Ilvala’s body thanks to their possession of a pair of amulets of return (see new magic items). When Ilvala is reconstituted within a diner’s stomach, the reconstitution effectively kills the diner as the pieces of meat transform into a full-sized rakshasa. Death occurs in 1-4 rounds. Vatapi commences the reconstitution by introducing the concept of his long lost sister to the conversation, and then ritually summoning Ilvala by name. Ilvala can only be reconstituted in one diner’s stomach, so if more than one visitor consumes the meat, the GM should roll randomly to determine which diner suffers this horrible fate. There are a few ways to avoid the rakshasas’ foul trick: one is to slay Vatapi before he can summon his sister by name; another is to prevent him from uttering his sister’s name through the imposition of silence. Should Vatapi and Tataka (see 8-125) be slain before the meat is consumed, moreover, Ilvala will have no way to return and will effectively rot into nothingness.

Hole in Ceiling: A ragged, 6’-diameter hole in the ceiling leads to area 8-118A in the tunnel network that snakes around the old Besa complex. The rakshasas are aware of the hole, but view it more as a potential source of food than as a danger point.

Ilvala, a rakshasa initially disguised as cooked meat: SZ M; AL LE; AC -4; MV 150’; HD 7; HP 45; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/2-5. Special defenses: ESP; affected only by 8th-level spells or greater; immune to normal weapons; half damage from +1 and +2 weapons. Cleric spells: curse, light, fear. Magic User spells: charm person, jump, magic missile, sleep; audible glamer, darkness 15’ radius, mirror image; dispel magic, suggestion. Possessions: rudishva jump suit; rudishva breather (see new technological items); potion of invisibility; half of a pair of amulets of return (see new magic items).

Vatapi (possibly present; see text): for stats, see 8-120.

Tataka, also possibly present; for stats, see 8-125.

Treasure:
There is no treasure here save the personal equipment borne by the rakshasas.

### 8-125: Temple of Besa: Rakshasa Lair

The rakshasas have converted the ancient quarters of the high priestess of Besa into their sanctum. It is dimly lit by four smokeless torches (see new magic items), and includes a riot of exotic and sumptuous items. Unless he has already been encountered in 8-124, Tataka the rakshasa will be found here; if Vatapi has been chased from 8-120 or 8-124, he too will be present here.

The chamber includes four elaborate day beds carved of teak (950 gp each) and set with brightly colored silk sheets and pillows. Six oriental carpets cover the floor, each a masterpiece of geometric and animal pattern (800 gp each). Four more carpets hang on the north and south walls, covering badly damaged frescoes that depict the debased rituals of Besa’s cult; these carpets are figural, and depict strangely-accoutered warriors with spears 
and curved swords. One of the four is, in fact, a porter’s carpet (see new magic items). A welter of small tables occupies the rest of the floor space; there are ten, ranging from a pair of 4’-tall, 2’-diameter tables of solid ivory (1,800 gp each), to a set of five oval tea tables in teak and ivory, a pair of mahogany end tables (400 gp each), and a magnificent sandalwood gaming table inset with ivory and gold (2,250 gp), on which the rakshasas play endless 
games of backgammon while awaiting victims (the ivory pieces are worth another 200 gp). A low bookcase holds the following tomes: Laelius Praetor’s the Ancient Ones; Archons of Arden Vul; the Book of Night Maneuvers; A Canticle of Arcane Knowledge; Elements of Animal Reproduction; Green are My Lover’s Eyes; the Highly Impressive Story of Frigg the Fabulous; Locomotion in Animals and Humanoids; Sorcerous Properties of Gems; and the Twelve Labors of Arden (see Arden Vul books for all). In the northeast corner is a 
jumble of brightly colored plasteel equipment, which (if PCs ever were to peacefully enter this chamber) the rakshasas represent as their all-important rudishva technology; the equipment is indeed rudishva in origin, but it is broken and useless. 

On either side of the secret door on the west wall stand two 6’-tall statues carved out of ironwood. Each depicts a grimacing demon warrior holding a glaive; the face of each warrior has tusks and wild eyes. Each statue is decorated with an Khumus-style bronze helmet (50 gp each), a set of four gold arm rings shaped like snakes (300 gp each), a steel breastplate, a pair of steel greaves, and four gold finger rings set with black pearls (800 gp each). 

Each pair of breastplate and greaves is actually a set of abyssal armor (see new magic items). One of the glaives is normal, but the other is a powerful sentient magic item, named Bhima (see new magic items). The northern statue also bears an exotic silver necklace from which dangle thirteen 4”-long curved fangs; these are rakshasa fangs, which may be used to open the secret doors here and in 8-111. The necklace of fangs could be sold for 600 gp.

Scattered among the tea tables are the following magical items: a set of eyes of Pol, a bag of efreeti sand, an insidious bone flute, and a set of predictive tokens (see new magic items for all).Secret Door (west): The door is normal to detect, and opens in one of two ways: either a rakshasa tooth must be inserted into a hidden hole, or a successful lift gates roll must be made to force it open.

Tataka the rakshasa SZ M; AL LE; AC -4; MV 150’; HD 7; HP 41; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/2-5. Special defenses: ESP; affected only by 8th-level spells or greater; immune to normal weapons; half damage from +1 and +2 weapons. Cleric spells: curse, light, fear. Magic User spells: charm person, jump, magic missile, sleep; audible glamer, darkness 15’ radius, mirror image; dispel magic, suggestion. Possessions: rudishva jump suit; rudishva breather (see new technological items); potion of invisibility; wand of fire (11 charges).

Vatapi the rakshasa (see stats at 8-120)

### 8-126: Trophy Room

If the rakshasas’ living quarters reflect a certain raffish opulence and civilization, their trophy room bears witness to their evil and their monstrous nature, for it is here that the rakshasas devour their victims. Gouts of dried blood stain the walls, while two piles of human and other bones occupy the northeastern and south-eastern corners. Two scorched varumani corpses hang from hooks, dripping blood onto the floor. 

The west wall features shelves built into the stone; these shelves contain twenty-one life-sized heads made of clay, modeled to reflect different types of creatures (some human, some humanoid, some varumani, and some utterly exotic). These clay heads are connected to the memory trap in 8-111; the memories of those affected by the trap are transferred here, to one of the ‘empty’ heads appropriate to their race. Smashing a skull releases a trapped memory to its owner, regardless of where that being may be. A dull yellow glow in the eyes of a head reveals the fact that it is ‘occupied’ by a being’s memory. Currently six of the twenty-one heads are occupied. Four of those whose memories have been stolen are 
Hakreon (7-76), Kormak (8-132), Justine Two-Hands (9-130), and Niskim the goblin (8-114). It is up to the GM to decide the nature of the other stored memories. 

Treasure:
On one of the shelves among the clay heads is a platinum key to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D). The rakshasas know it’s enchanted but never figured out what it is used for, and have forgotten about it.

### 8-127: Goat Pen

The rakshasas (8-125) keep a small herd of six goats penned up in this crumbling corridor fragment. They use the goats for meat if they are unable to acquire other victims, but might also use the goats as part of a longer term plan to trick unwary PCs who accept the premise of their habitation. Half of a wine cask filled with musty water sits at the south end of the fragment.

### 8-128: Empty Cave 

This cave contains nothing of note save the bliss pollen. The tunnel connecting it to 8-68 is blocked by creepers; it takes 1-2 rounds to force one’s way through the creepers.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

### 8-129: Cave with Tunnel up to 6-60

This nondescript cave connects to a thoqqua tunnel that leads up to the Arena area of Level 6 (area 6-60). The tunnel is steep and quite smooth, and reduces movement by half. Two extremely large thoqqua are still rooting around in the rock surrounding this cave. 

The tunnel connecting it to 8-68 is blocked by creepers; it takes 1-2 rounds to force one’s way through the creepers.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

2 large thoqqua: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 120’, 30’ burrowing through rock; HD 4; HP 28, 24; #AT 1 and 1; Dmg 4-32/2-12. Special attacks: heat. Special defenses: healed by fire.

### 8-130: Cave with Glyph

This cave features several impressive bits of flowstone in beautiful caramel colors. One of the flows emerges from the northern niche, which is naturally quite damp. The source of this flow has almost (but not quite) obscured a glowing green wizard mark featuring the entwined letters “K” and “B” (for Kel Bormol; see SL3-2A). The glyph is a wizard’s cache (see new spells), place here by Kel Bormol as a way to secure the key to his secret lair (8-133). 

The password to the cache is, unsurprisingly, “Kel Bormol”; only by reciting this password or casting dispel magic at level 19 or above can the cache be opened.

The cache contains a very large, cartoonish key that fits the lock on the door to 8-133. It also contains a bag of powdered platinum (1,000 gp) and a scroll of passwall.

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

### 8-131: Cave with Pit

In the center of this crossroads cave is a 15’-diameter, 40’-deep shaft, bored in the distant past by Kel Bormol (SL3-2A) as part of his failed initial effort to construct a hidden sanctum. More recently some cruel adventurers have covered the opening with a mat of reeds sprinkled with rock dust and sand. 

Trap: Pit trap with obscured reed-mat cover. Anyone crossing the mat has a 75% chance of falling through into the pit, thus taking 4-24 HP damage. 

Note: This area is occluded by a thick cloud of bliss pollen (see new flora).

Treasure:
At the bottom of the pit is a sack holding three doses of varumani knock-out juice (see Arden Vul items).

### 8-132: Cave with a Weeping Warrior

In this pollen-free cave, a tough Wiskin warrior is slowly banging his head against the south wall, weeping uncontrollably. He wears a Norman helmet and a chain mail byrnie on which is painted a yellow snake, and bears a serrated long sword. He is Kormak the Snake, and he fell victim to the memory trap in 8-111. Desolate and lost, he is barely functional, and greets all visitors with suspicion (-10% to reaction rolls). If Kormak grows hostile, he shouts simple insults in Wiskin and, if the PCS respond with aggression, attacks.

Should he somehow be befriended, and his memory restored (see 8-126), he will be grateful and will be able to pass on the following bits of information: he talked to Olaf the Bee-Whisperer (8-73) and learned that a strange scepter is lodged in one of the bee hives (see 8-69). This object is the lost scepter of the goblins (see new magic items) which is greatly desired by King Weskenim (SL4-22). Kormak has also visited the temple of Bastet (8-38) and 
can give advice on how best to reach the temple and negotiate with the priestesses there. Finally, he also knows that the Forge of Zhorak (8-120) is quite close, only a few hours march to the west and north, even though he has never been there.

The door on the south wall is wizard locked (18th level), but also boasts an exaggeratedly-large keyhole. The wizard lock can be bypassed by use of the correct key (see 8-130).

Kormak the Snake, 8th-level male Wiskin fighter: SZ M; AL N; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 88; #AT 3/2; Dmg 4-11 (Lithast). Abilities: STR 17, INT 9, WIS 10, DEX 8, CON 17, CHA 14. 
Possessions: the enchanted long sword, Lithast (see new magic items); a chain mail +2; a purse with 275 gp and 148 sp; and a potion of superheroism.

### 8-133: Kel Bormol’s Hidden Lair 

The late-Archontean-era archmage, Kel Bormol (see SL3-2A), converted this tomb into one of the hidden refuges that he prepared in and around Arden Vul as he watched the city devolve into chaos. The door to the lair (in 8-132) is wizard locked (18th level), and can only be opened by magic or by locating the key (8-130).

The tomb was that of Liskon the Mad, the 8th archon of Arden Vul, and a lesser figure in Archontean lore. Liskon was paranoid, and ordered his resting place built in this then-obscure location, far from the growing court. The walls are decorated with shallow carvings of imperial officials in archaic togas and costumes performing administrative and judicial functions. At the center of the scene is a bearded archon (Liskon). When he claimed the 
tomb, Kel Bormol covered up the earlier art with a set of three large ‘modern’ tapestries; one showing the signing of the Compact of Ennius (see World of Archontos appendix), one depicting the great victory of the imperial legions at Trenner’s Rock (see World of Archontos appendix), and the third displaying the grim court held by Emperor Maurikios IV Sanguinator in the smoking rubble of Arden Vul after its sacking. Each tapestry is worth 750 gp.

The northern section of the sanctum contains a trio of leather easy chairs (65 gp each), a low oak table (25 gp), a wine rack (with six ultra-rare, and still drinkable, Archontean whites that are 1,300 years old and worth 950 gp each), a daybed with satin sheets (covered in dust), an oak scroll cabinet, and a staff rack with six walking staffs (two of polished oak, one of ebony, one of natural pine, and the last a staff of withering with 9 charges).

The scroll cabinet contains eleven items, all cheesy light fiction and soft-core pornography, with titles like the Whispering Widow, Legionary Rex and the Celadon Shipment, Paulus and the Goblin King, The Night Urges, Euphronia’s Awakening, and Meson’s Guide to the Brothels of Archontos (see Arden Vul books for all). In addition to these well-thumbed items, copies of Kel Bormol’s eleven spell books are hidden in a secret compartment at the base of the cabinet. The compartment detects normally and opens by inserting a quill-sized item into a small hole on the left side of the cabinet.

The southern portion of the chamber still holds Liskon’s tomb, a 10’x8’x4’ block of granite carved with an image of the archon (the bearded man with the cylindrical hat from the walls). Kel Bormol has draped a now-rotted cotton tablecloth across the tomb, and a sixteen-piece set of silver tableware rests atop it (425 gp for the set). A pair of the silver cups hold a map open on the tablecloth. The map shows a substantial section of the precincts of Set, in full detail (including secret doors): areas 4-1 to 4-58 and 4-101 to 4-105. The map was annotated by Kel Bormol, indicating the function and/or residents of each area. Along the south wall are three crates that contain long spoiled foodstuffs.

If Kel Bormol has been released (see SL3-2A), then the entire area will be cleaned, the table-cloth replaced with a new one, and a fresh set of food items will be present. In such circumstances there is a 20% chance Kel Bormol himself will be present in the chamber.

A pair of invisible stalkers wait patiently in the chamber, tasked a millennium ago to ensure that no one but Kel Bormol enters the chamber. Although their long servitude has rendered them insane, Kel Bormol’s binding still holds. They do not pursue outside the sanctum.

2 invisible stalkers: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 61, 50; #AT 1; Dmg 4-16; MR 30%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-5. Special defenses: invisibility.

Kel Bormol’s Spell Books (in eleven large volumes): All 1st-level spells plus Basil’s torch treatment, Cleophalus’s look-away spell, and friend of the Hekate (see new spells for all three); all 2nd-level spells plus the Bracteros effect, locate place, Pol’s endless sneezes, pummeling fists of Arak-Zhorr, and wizard’s cache (see new spells for all five); all 3rd-level spells plus garrulous mouth (see new spells); all 4th-level spells plus Dameon’s shadow spell book (see new spells); all 5th-level spells plus harnessing the chaos, the hekate’s bonds, and 
Pol’s improved eye (see new spells for all three); anti-magic shell, curse item (see new spells), death spell, disintegrate, enchant an item, extension III, forceful hand, geas, globe of invulnerability, invisible stalker, legend lore, monster summoning IV, project image, reincarnation, repulsion, stone to flesh, transformation; cacodemon, delayed blast 
fireball, duo-dimension, grasping hand, limited wish, mass invisibility, monster summoning V, Pol’s recall (see new spells), power word stun, vanish, warding chain of glyphs (see new 
spells); clenched fist, incendiary cloud, irresistible dance, mass charm, mind blank, mindshift (see new spells), monster summoning VI, permanency, polymorph object, power word blind, spell immunity, symbol; astral spell, crushing hand, gate, meteor swarm, power word kill, prismatic sphere, time stop.

### 8-134: Concealed Cave with Rock Formations 

The entrance to this cave is concealed behind the mat of vines and creepers that fills area 8-68; it takes 1-3 rounds to push through the creepers. The cave is 25’ tall and is surprisingly devoid of bliss pollen; it is cool and damp. Three large rock formations stand in the center of the sandy floor; the northern two extend all the way to the ceiling, but the southern formation is only 20’ tall. Atop the southern formation is a fire ring besides which lies the skeleton of a long-dead dwarven adventurer, still wearing equipment. Also atop the southern formation is a small patch of aqua vitae mushrooms, enough for 6 doses (see new flora).

Treasure:
Six doses of aqua vitae mushrooms (see new flora), and on the skeleton: a dwarf-sized suit of banded mail +3; an inert dwarven life-stone (see new magic items) bearing the name in Dwarven Runic of Gypsum Hornfels; a fine but non-magical war hammer inscribed with the clan ‘Hornfels’ insignia; a silver belt (250 gp); and a backpack with a coil of rope, six spikes, a hammer, two flasks of oil, and a bag of carefully polished marbles.

### 8-135: Cave with Warning Signs 

Three thick spears are thrust into the sand that covers the floor of this cave; a varumani skull is perched atop each one. The skulls have been there for a long time (hundreds of years), and the purpose for their placement has been long forgotten. Jammed into one of the skulls is a piece of parchment that provides the following bit of advice in Archontean: “the tomb of Marius the Great is now inaccessible, save through the hidden door in the propagandistic 
‘shrine’ to the archon. One must still placate the guardians.” [GM: the note refers to the shrine of Marius (6-145) with its ceiling exit that leads eventually to the tomb of Marius (6-154)].

## Level 8: 136 - 150

### 8-136: Renegade Varumani

A band of renegade lesser and bestial varumani have abandoned the domain of the thegn (see much of Level 7, including, e.g., 7-2 and 7-8 to 7-38) and set themselves up as robbers in this cave. 

The gang is led by Lugo, and contains a total of eight members. The bestial varumani are growing restless with Lugo’s leadership, however, as they (rightly) blame him for failing to procure suitable meat. Familiar with stories of ‘civilized robbers’, however, Lugo has to date restrained his followers and convinced them that extortion is better than murder. He has them all wearing ‘stylish’ green berets.

The gang has built a low rock wall (4’ tall) across the mouth of the cave, giving their members 50% cover (and serving to deter the rust monsters (see 8-140). They have also placed torches in the passageway to 8-137. They loudly demand ‘tribute’ of any who pass, in the form of silver coins (50 sp per head) or pretty rocks (gemstones, of any sort). If the tribute is paid, Lugo will most likely restrain his fellows from attacking (75%). The gang attacks if one of the following occurs: 1) the tribute is not paid; 2) the victims pay, but are not suitably humble; or 3) the bestial varumani simply decide to attack regardless of Lugo’s orders (25%).

Inside their cave, the gang has accumulated three hammocks, two kegs of Hak’s ale (see 7-94), three dead goats, two recently slain adventurers hanging from hooks, a sack of dried edible mushrooms; two shields; five spears; and a wooden chest with their loot.

The varumani feed all metal except coins (e.g., the armor of the dead adventurers) to the rust monsters in 8-140. There is a 15% chance that noisy combat here draws the rust monsters within three rounds; the chance rises by 5% for every round starting with the fourth.

Lugo, a lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 57; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (mace, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-
affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: stone club (as mace); shield.

2 more lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 57, 53; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

5 bestial varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58, 57, 55, 53, 49; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; immune to poison.

Treasure:
In addition to the mundane equipment, the loot chest contains: 793 sp; 174 gp; 101 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items); 3 citrines (55 gp each), 4 zircons (45 gp each), 2 peridots (500 gp each), and an orange jacinth (5,000 gp); a set of six throwing daggers +1; a set of Banion’s dice made of bone (see new magic items); and a pair of boots of the ogre (see new magic items).

### 8-137: Cave with Cliff and Tunnel Up to 7-40

This large, 60’-tall cavern has a particularly uneven floor, with lots of small holes and ridges. Movement is reduced by half, or else explorers risk a 25% chance per round of taking 1-4 damage from tripping on the terrain. The cavern is dominated by an imposing, 40’-tall cliff that runs along its southern edge. The cliff face is relatively smooth, and can be climbed with some difficulty by thieves (-10% to climb walls). A shelf extends along the south wall above the cliff, beyond which is a steeply rising tunnel that leads to area 7-40.

Two patches of worked stone exist, one at the bottom of the cliff by the eastern edge, and the other at the top of the cliff in the same location. At each location the rock floor has been smoothed flat in a 15’-diameter circle, and a short piece of doggerel has been inscribed on the flattened rock. An oaken shepherd’s crook some 10’ high is firmly inserted into the rock in the exact center of each location; from each crook hangs a copper bell about 3’ in diameter. 

The doggerel is written in Mithric, and reads as follows:

Five for the furious
Four for some fun
Three for trouble
Two to be spun
And One? One is for the lonely

The doggerel provides a clue to using the bells. Each number in the verse refers to a number of rings of one of the bells, and provides a cryptic clue to the effects wrought by ringing the bell that many times. The only safe solution is to ring the bell twice (‘to be spun’). 

All of the effects are summarized as follows:

Num of Rings Effect
Five

Fury: All within 20’ must save versus spells or attack someone nearby for 1-4 rounds

Four

Fun: Three imps dressed as clowns are summoned. The imps perform card tricks and sleight of hand for one turn. At the end of the show, one passes his bowler hat: if at least 10 gp are placed in the hat, the imps leave without incident. If no tip is offered, or it is less than 10 gp, or if they are interrupted during the show, the imps attack for 4-5 rounds before returning 
to their home plane. 3 imps: SZ S; AL LE; AC 2; MV 60’, 180’ flying (Class C); HD 2+2; HP 16, 14, 13; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4; MR 25%. Special attacks: poison. Special defenses: silver, or +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire, cold and electricity; save vs magic as 7 HD creatures. Special: polymorph self (to animal form); detect magic; detect good; detect magic; invisibility; regenerate 1 hp/round, suggestion 1/day

Three

Trouble: An aerial servant is summoned. It attacks immediately, with a 50% chance of seeking to grab victims, flying to the roof of the cave, and dropping them for 6d6 damage. Aerial servant: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 240’; HD 16; HP 101; #AT 1; Dmg 8-32; surprise on 1-4; grab attack; surprise foes with4 in 6 chance.

Two

To be Spun: The bell ringers is spun in a circle three times, and then teleported to the flattened rock on the other side of the cliff (i.e., from the foot ofthe cliff to the top, or vice versa)

One

Lonely: The bell ringer is teleported to a random location in Arden Vul. To determine, roll d8:
1= area AV-27
2= area 4-163
3= area 6-55
4= area 7-130
5= area 8-84
6= SL3-5
7= SL4-53
8= SL7-39 

### 8-138: Caves with Iron Ore 

A vein of iron ore runs east from this crossroads in the cave network. The rust monsters from 8-140 use the vein as a primary source of nutrition and, as a result, there is a 20% chance for the pair to be present here. A pair of pick handles lie in the intersection; the rust monsters corroded and ate the metal heads.

2 rust monsters (20%): see stats in 8-140.

### 8-139: Cave 

A pile of wooden boards and two wooden wheels stand in the center of this chamber; formerly a cart, the rust monsters who live in 8-140 ate away the metal fittings that held it together. The circular knob to the east has a deep (30’) well of cold, clear spring water. There is a 20% chance that the rust monsters are here, poking around the cart remnants or drinking water. A beautifully carved, 3’-tall, jade statuette of a warrior turning to fire an arrow over his shoulder rests at the bottom of the well. The warrior wears his long hair in two topknots that drop down his back, has a long, droopy mustache, and wears lacquered armor; all of these features mark him as a Khumus nomad from the west, and not an Archontean.

2 rust monsters (20%): see stats in 8-140.

Treasure:
Jade statuette of a western nomad, worth 4,000 gp

### 8-140: Rust Monster Lair 

A pair of mated rust monsters has made this cave their lair. It is scattered with broken stalagmites and small remnants of oxidized and digested metals. The rust monsters are quite agile, and are adept at jumping from the cave floor to the stalagmite fragments, and from there to any source of metal.

The western niche has their nest, in which are three rust monster eggs (worth 450 gp to a dealer in a large town). Tucked among the eggs are two spell scrolls.

The rust monsters are familiar with the varumani gang at 8-136, and occasionally visit that area seeking handouts of metal. 

The sound of combat at 8-136 will eventually draw the rust monsters (15% for first three rounds of combat; chances rises by 5% per subsequent round). If not already encountered at 8-136, there is a 20% chance the pair will be scrounging in 8-138, a 20% chance they will be in 8-139, a 10% chance they will be in 8-141, and a 50% chance they will be present in this, their lair. Loud noise in any of the neighboring caves (8-138, 8-139, or 8-141) draws them in 1-4 rounds.

2 rust monsters: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 180’; HD 5; HP 36, 29; #AT 2; Dmg nil. Special attacks: corrode metal.

Treasure:
A clerical scroll with hallow on it, and a magic user scroll with the spell harnessing the chaos on it (see new spells for each). Also three rust monster eggs (450 gp each).

### 8-141: Lurker Cave

This broad cave is 40’ tall at its northwestern, open end, but thanks to a large flowstone drift the southeastern end is only 15’ tall. The flowstone is a beautiful caramel color, and is slightly wet. Scattered about the flowstone are four piles of cleaned bones, including a recent pile that seems to have been a 5’-tall quadruped (a rust monster).

The tunnel to the south leads to a locked stone door, on which is inscribed an Archontean seal. Only those with a previously-demonstrated dedication to ancient history or architecture have a chance (15%) to recognize the seal as that of Phocion the Builder, the famous architect (see his statue at SL7-22). Before the door is another pile of bones, this time of a human adventurer; thanks to the lurkers above, the rust monsters have not yet been able to 
devour the adventurer’s gear.

Two lurkers above make the cave their home. One typically is found in the large open area, while the other lurks in the tunnel, just above the door to 8-142.

As the lurkers have recently slain one of their number, the rust monsters are hesitant to visit this cave, even though they can smell the metallic treasure to the south. As a result, there is only a 10% chance for the rust monsters to be present here.

2 lurkers above: SZ L; AL N; AC 6; MV 10’, 90’ flying (Class D); HD 10; HP 68, 64; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: surprise 4 in 6; constriction; suffocation. Special defenses: 90% undetectable against stone.

2 rust monsters (10%): see stats at 8-140.

Treasure:
Near the bones of the adventurer: banded mail +2; glaive-guisarme +1; a crossbow with 15 bolts; 1,741 gp scattered on the floor; and a gold ring (450 gp).

### 8-142: False Tomb of Phocion the Builder

The tomb of the famed Arden Vul architect, Phocion the Builder, lies in this forgotten corner of Level 8. Responsible for designing most of the public spaces in the city, as well as the main temples of Thoth and Set, Phocion was a major figure in the glory days of Arden Vul. 

The stone door to this false tomb is locked, and marked with the seal of Phocion (see 8-141). It can be opened by picking the lock (-15% chance) or breaking down the door (3-6 turns).

The chamber within is 15’ tall, with walls simply decorated with a single word inscribed in Mithric. To the east, the word is ‘beauty’, to the south ‘strength, and to the west ‘utility’. The 
inscriptions stand out from the bare granite because they are filled with silver (150 gp total). 

Sarcophagus: The chamber is dominated by a 12’x5’x4’ sarcophagus made of stone. Atop the sarcophagus is a fine gisant of Phocion, dressed simply in a tunic with a belt pouch, and carrying a level and a set of architect’s dividers. The lid of the sarcophagus can be removed by making a successful bend bars roll. Within is a 6’x3’x2’ compartment, in which a set of human bones rest. A scattering of 53 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items) and 157 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) carpets the inner compartment.

In addition, a tightly rolled scroll rests within: it bears the title Testament of Phocion the Builder (see Arden Vul books). The scroll contains an acrostic that hints at the location of the secret door on the south wall; the door is located under the ‘S’ in the inscription (‘strength’) found on that wall.

False Door: To the west is a small (only 4’x3’) stone door. Despite its inviting nature, it is impossible to open.

Secret Door (south): This door is quite small (3’x3’) and difficult to detect (1 in 8). It can only be opened by sheer physical force (i.e., by succeeding at a bend bars roll, or by spending six turns noisily destroying it with suitable tools).

### 8-143: Tomb of Phocion the Builder

The tomb of Phocion is a striking epitome of the artistry of a gifted designer and his workmen. The ceiling is 15’ tall, and carved so as to suggest a wooden beamed ceiling. Two 10’x4’x4’ stone sarcophagi and two tall bronze statues provide a natural focus to those entering. Large, silver-filled inscriptions occupy the diagonal walls of the northern and southern niches. A 20’-diameter mosaic, surrounded by another silver inscription, occupies the floor in the center of the chamber. 

Inscriptions: The letters are in Mithric and filled with silver. It takes a turn to scrape the silver out of each inscription, earning the thief 65 gp per inscription. Clockwise from the northwest, the inscriptions read:

Northwest: Theory and practice are the sires of art.

Northeast: Strength means locating a solid foundation and choosing proper materials. 

Southeast: Utility requires a judicious distribution of the parts, with each in its proper place serving its proper purpose. 

Southwest: Beauty derives from a proper sense of proportion and from the pleasing appearance and good taste of the whole.

Mosaic: The mosaic is beautiful, with tesserae of brightly colored stone forming four quadrants. In a separate circular band around the mosaic proper are the word Proportion, Uniformity, Consistency, Economy. The quadrant by the word ‘proportion’ shows a rectangle made of silver tesserae surrounded by azure blue tiles; if measured, it appears that the long side is twice as long as the short side [this is not quite the golden ratio, but it comes close]. 

The quadrant next to the word ‘uniformity’ shows an elevation of a building front, in ivory tesserae with thin black onyx edges, with three columns on either side of a central door. The third quadrant, next to the word ‘consistency’, features the front and side of a dwelling in one-point perspective, as well as a rose compass; the building is in ivory tesserae with edges marked out in thin pieces of black onyx. The columns at the front are simple (doric), and 
there is a window in the side wall. The rose compass indicates that the window is to the east. The final quadrant has a small person (in blue quartz) inspecting pieces of granite, silver and marble; close inspection shows the figure is pointing to the granite piece. 

If the mosaic is destroyed, the value of the tesserae is 500 gp; if the mosaic is somehow excavated and brought to civilization (it weighs 600 lb), it would be worth 10,500 gp. 

Statues: The eastern and western niches contain 8’-tall bronze statues of Phocion. The eastern statue shows Phocion as a typical Archontean aristocrat, dressed in a toga and gesturing into the center of the room. The other statue depicts him as an architect, wearing a simple tunic and belt pouch and holding forth his dividers and level. Both show him with closely trimmed beard and hair, and with a naturalistic face (large nose, several warts, and 
kind eyes). Although tarnished by age and humidity, the statues are great works of art and could fetch 2,500 gp each from an Archontean collector.

Sarcophagi: The sarcophagus to the north is a plain rectangle some 12’x8’x4’ in dimensions. The word “Phocion” is inscribed on the lid and a continuous mid-relief sculpture runs along its side. The images represent the builder at work, directing men raising stone blocks, carving out caverns, and erecting a pyramid. The lid may easily be prised open; within are the mummified remains of Phocion, surrounded by desiccated flowers, pure white sand, and 
several valuable objects: a ring of fire resistance (actually a ring of delusion); a heavy signet ring with the letter ‘P’ (450 gp); a rod of beguiling (19 charges); a rudishva repli-cube and a partly-full rudishva lesser power supply (see new technological items); and a platinum cloak pin set with lapis (850 gp). 

If activated, the repli-cube immediately projects an image of Phocion as an old man; the aged architect speaks in Mithric for 8 minutes about several matters. First, he speaks for 4 minutes about the principles of proper architectural design, emphasizing the four key components of proportion, uniformity, consistency, and economy. The second portion of the recording is more confessional; Phocion modestly describes his dividers (see 8-144), gliding quickly over their properties before lamenting the greed and deception he could see in his comrades’ eyes as Phocion himself grew closer to death. Phocion then becomes slightly 
opaque, noting that he devised one last ‘great work’ meant to keep the dividers secret until ‘one who was worthy’ proved capable of understanding Phocion’s life work and the ‘proper combination of beauty, function, and strength’ (a reference to the puzzle here in 8-143, and the hidden room where the dividers rest to this day). The charge on the power supply only allows the recording to be played twice before it is exhausted; of course those with their own 
power supplies and knowledge of how to use them could easily replay the image (or even record over it).

The second ‘sarcophagus’ is actually a stone table, carved on its side in the same scheme as the northern sarcophagus. It detects strongly of magic. A grid of ½”-square holes and a rose compass is carved into the top of the table; there are nineteen holes in each row/column, each 1” from its neighbor. This means that each side of the grid is 26.5” wide from corner to corner, and that there are a total of 361 holes. 

Arranged around the grid are neat piles of appropriately sized building materials made of different substances. There are three piles of 3 ½”-wide, 7”-tall wall segments, each cut so as to have ½”-square pegs spaced 1” apart on its base and inset along its height so as to allow the insertion of up to three pillars along the front of the wall segment. The piles are divided by material: one of 15 wall segments in silver, one of 15 in granite, and one of 15 in white marble. A fourth pile contains wall segments with windows; there are four segments in silver, four in granite, and four in white marble. Another six piles contain pillars that can be inserted into wall segments. There are piles of oak, ebony, silver, gold, white marble, and granite pillars; each pile contains 48 pillars. Finally there are three piles of roof pieces, with each pile distinguished by size and material. One of the roof piles has six pieces, 2 ends and four interior pieces; each piece is 3 ½” by 3 ½”, and is made of silver. The second pile of roof pieces contains granite pieces 7” by x 3 ½” in size; there are two end pieces and six interior pieces. The last pile of roof pieces is in white marble, with pieces measuring 10 ½” by 3 ½”; there are two end pieces and eight interior pieces. All roof pieces are gabled roofs; end pieces have a pediment on one side, while interior pieces are just the roof itself. The roof pieces are clearly suited to laying across the wall pieces. Regardless of what explorers do with the building pieces, the entire set could be sold for 5,000 gp.

Puzzle: Clearly the ‘building blocks’ are a puzzle. If a Greek-style building is constructed following the principles hinted at in the mosaic and inscriptions, the secret door to area 8-144 opens with an audible click. To activate this magical trigger, the following principles must be followed:

1. A structure must be built, using the grid on the table top, using wall segments, pillars, and roof pieces
2. The proportions of the structure must be 2:1 (per the mosaic hint). Although buildings of any size could be constructed in this proportion, the size of the roof pieces (either 3 ½”, 7”, or 10 ½”) functionally limits a builder’s choices to one of the following: a building with one wall segment on the short side and two on the long side, or a structure with two wall segments on the short side and four on the long side, or a building with three wall segments on the short side and six segments on the long side. Building in any of these ways satisfies Phocion’s requirement of ‘proportion’, although only one of the three choices satisfies the principle of ‘economy’ (see below).
3. The eastern wall of the structure must contain at least one window; the rose compass determines which side is east. This satisfies the principle of ‘consistency’.
4. The materials used must be uniform, that is, the entire building must be composed of granite, silver, or white marble (but see point 5). Adding pillars of any of the ‘odd’ materials is unacceptable. Building in this way satisfies the principle of ‘uniformity’.
5. The building must be constructed using granite, not silver or white marble. This satisfies Phocion’s principle of ‘economy’. This requirement effectively limits the size of the structure to be built because only one of the three sizes of roofing comes in granite (the 7” x 3 ½” size). 

By following all these principles, it will become evident that the only solution to the puzzle is as follows: use two granite wall segments on each short sides and four granite wall segments on each long side; on the eastern long side, include at least one window; use granite pillars throughout; and use the granite roof pieces.Secret Door (west wall): The door on the west wall is normal to detect, but is magically held. Only solving the architectural puzzle (see above) will cause the door to open with an audible click. Other than this method, only very powerful magic allows access to 8-144.

Treasure:
1. In Phocion’s sarcophagus: ring of fire resistance (actually ring of delusion), a signet ring (450 gp), rod of beguiling, a rudishva repli-cube and lesser power supply (see new technological items), and a platinum cloak pin (850 gp).
2. Statues: 2,500 gp each, if a way to move them is found.
3. Mosaic: 500 gp if destroyed, 10,500 gp if somehow transported intact.
4. Building set: up to 5,000 gp to a collector of curiosities.

### 8-144: Phocion’s Dividers

Phocion’s most valued item is hidden in this secret chamber. 

The secret door that leads to the chamber can only be opened by solving the puzzle in 8-144 or by employing very powerful magic (passwall, etc.).

The chamber within is simple and undecorated. A stone pedestal stands in the center of the chamber, surrounded by four simple stone benches. Atop the pedestal, wrapped in a piece of yellow silk, are Phocion’s dividers, a potent magical artifact (see new magic items).

Treasure:
Phocion’s dividers (see new magic items).

### 8-145: Broken Hall 

This worked chamber has suffered badly from the deprivations of time. Two corridor fragments end in cave-ins. Strands of plaster hang from the ceiling, and mounds of broken tiling dot the floor. In the northeast corner stands a striking statue in basalt, with ivory accents (hair, clothing, sandals). The pediment reads “Eustachius the cantor, who located the Singing Grotto.” Strangely, Eustachius appears in this guise without ornate Thothian decoration, merely as a handsome man of middle age dressed in a tunic. He points to the south with one arm, and holds a cithara in the other. The statue is of high quality, and despite weighing 550 lb, could bring 900 gp if sold. [GM Note: one of Eustachius’s personal books may be found at 3-57].

### 8-146: Entrance to the Singing Grotto

Amid the collapsed stonework of this ruined hallway sits the still-functional destination for the teleporter at 8-7E. That destination is marked by a 5’-diameter circle of rose quartz set in the floor. Next to the circle are three backpacks containing some functional adventuring items.

Treasure:
The backpacks contain three 50’ coils of rope; a dozen caltrops; a hammer and chisel; a sack with 549 sp; a fish-shaped control rod for the eggs at 4-85; a functional rudishva lesser power supply (see new technological items); four wax candles; a small silver mirror; and six days of still-edible iron rations.

### 8-147: Antechamber to Singing Grotto 

A 20’-diameter mosaic sits in the center of this 15’-tall antechamber, and seven oversized (10’ tall) stone doors line the walls. Six relatively recent corpses are strewn about the floor. 

Mosaic: The mosaic shows at its center a Thothian cleric, singing sweetly. In the first circular register around him are some unusual, tribal-looking heads with open mouths, each with a letter from A to G under it. The outer register shows various creatures, some recognizable but others alien. The clever may notice that a head and letter are associated with a particular figure in the outer register, in the manner indicated by this table (see areas 8-147A to 8-147G for explanations):

Head and Letter Creature
A A butterfly-like creature with open mouth
B A baboon-headed biped with four arms
C A cleric of Thoth in formal, orange, ceremonial garb
D A pair of black birds (starlings)
E Another butterfly-like creature with open mouth
F A fire-breathing dog
G A blocky, golem-like entity

Doors: The doors are 10’x4’ in size, and cannot be opened from 8-147 (they are magically held). Only by manipulation of the horns at 8-148 (q.v.) may a door be opened. Once opened, a door may be spiked or otherwise held open for up to 6 hours, during which time the contents of its chamber do not replenish. Otherwise, once a door opens and shuts, the contents of the room to which it leads are instantly replenished.

Corpses: Two of the corpses appear to have been scorched, two more have been badly cut up, and the final two have no visible wounds save for blood in their ears. The equipment of some of the corpses is still usable (see below).

Backstory: Eustachius designed these doors and the summoning chambers to which they lead both for security and as a way of delighting his visitors. They were linked to specific songs and melodic moods as played by the horns and heads in 8-148. Although he initially changed the contents of the magical chambers on a regular basis, as he grew closer to death he tended to favor security (i.e., summoned entities) over entertainments.

On the corpses: leather armor +2, studded leather armor +1, banded mail +1, a shield +2, a two-handed sword, a long sword +1, a mace, six throwing axes, a guard cap (see new magic items), a pair of bracers of defenselessness, a bag of beans, two gold statuettes of Khumus warriors (450 gp each), an ebony and ivory lyre (800 gp), a scorched and useless spell book, a metal scroll case containing a protection from magic scroll, 479 gp and 563 sp. 

Next to one of the corpses: a shattered antique black-ware vase. If reassembled it shows a scene of a Thothian priest standing next to the Great Head, with the inscription (in Mithric) “Eustachius sings his lament to open the door” below it.

##### 8-147a: A is for Aerodis

When this door is opened, 1-3 hostile aerodes (see new monsters) are released. 

1-3 aerodes (see new monsters): SZ M; AC 0 or 6; MV 350’ flying (Class A); HD 6; HP 42, 41, 34; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: beneficial or detrimental songs. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; healed by fire; immune to magic missile, charm, confusion, hold, and mind-affecting spells.

##### 8-147b: B is for Baboons

When opened, this door releases a greater guardian of Thoth. The guardian allows those it confronts here or in 8-148 three rounds to recite the Litany of Light (see Arden Vul books) or else it attacks.

1 greater guardian of Thoth (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 0; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 55; #AT 4 or 1; Dmg 1-8/1-8/1-8/1-8 or 1-12; MR 20%. Special attacks: fear, stun. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; teleport without error 2/day.

##### 8-147c: C is for Care

Opening the door causes a helpful manifestation of Thoth to appear in the guise of a cleric of Thoth, complete with full ceremonial garb. The ‘cleric’ offers healing and succor to any who invoke Thoth: it can cast cure light wounds x3; cure serious wounds x2; cure deafness (reverse of the illusionist spell deafness); cure blindness; neutralize poison; and remove curse.

“Cleric” manifestation of Thoth, immune to attacks.

##### 8-147d: D is for Delight

Opening this door causes a flight of some 500 starlings to burst down the hallway to 8-148, where they circle, form a murmuration in the shape of an ibis, and then dart through the sinkhole at 8-148G and thence into the far reaches of Arden Vul. If summoned again, the flock may take other forms at the GM’s wish.

##### 8-147e: E is for Entertainment

Opening this door releases a peaceful aerodis (see new monsters). Unless attacked, the aerodis spends 1-4 turns singing beautiful, six-part melodies. In this period it runs through 1-2 of its ‘good’ songs. If attacked it functions as a hostile aerodis.

1 aerodis (see new monsters): SZ M; AC 0 or 6; MV 350’ flying (Class A); HD 6; HP 39; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12. Special attacks: beneficial or detrimental songs. Special defenses: +2 or better 
weapons to hit; healed by fire; immune to magic missile, charm, confusion, hold, and mind-affecting spells.

##### 8-147f: F is for Fire

Opening this door releases a pack of hell hounds.

8 hell hounds: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 5; HP 37, 35, 34, 33, 33, 32, 32, 30; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10. Special attacks: breathe fire; surprise on 1-4 in 6. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 2. Special: 50% to spot hidden or invisible.

##### 8-147g: G is for Guardians 

When opened, this door releases an imperial stone guardian. Since Eustachius is not present, the guardian immediately attacks. Once one guardian has been summoned, subsequent results for this chamber produce nothing (that is, only 1 imperial stone guardian may be summoned).

1 imperial stone guardian (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 58; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to 
missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

### 8-148: The Singing Grotto 

This large grotto was discovered by the cantor of the cult of Thoth, Eustachius. He developed it into one of the marvels of ancient Arden Vul, one known and appreciated by the elites whom Eustachius permitted to visit. The cave has a 35’ ceiling. Several pillars of rock extend from floor to ceiling (one also descends into a sinkhole). A light breeze circulates through the chamber in a counter-clockwise direction commencing from the natural pillar marked G. 

All of the natural stone – but not the shaped areas - is covered with whispering fungus (see new flora), a pale yellow, phosphorescent, and slightly furry fungus that ripples in the 
moving air. The fungus possesses a basic collective sentience in patches of 20 square feet or more, and one of its acts of volition is to ripple the air so as to create the breeze. 

The lightly sanded floor may appear to be natural, too, but dwarves will know immediately that it has been carefully shaped. 

The wall to the southeast has been worked; it was known as the wall of songs, where Eustachius recorded the most successful of his compositions. To the west are seven looping horns carved into the stone and enhanced with bronze mouthpieces. Carved into one side of each of the seven main stone pillars is a 3’-tall, tiki-like stone head. The southern niche, moreover, contains an enormous boulder (15’x15’x15’) that has been entirely shaped to resemble a huge stone head. 

GM Note: This puzzle chamber allows the curious and clever to interact with Eustachius’s great creation, the Singing Grotto. The basic idea is that each of the seven horns is connected to one of the lesser stone heads; sounding a horn produces a distinct note, which echoes forth from the appropriate stone head (sounding the A horn produces an A note from the head marked A). If one sounds the horn in a certain sequence, certain effects may be triggered, including the release of the creatures bound in area 8-147A to 8-147G. Once one is done sounding individual notes through the horns (via a delay of 3 rounds after the last note played), the Great Head sings the sequence out in a beautiful, sonorous bass. 
Replicating the sequence known as the Cantor’s Lament (see below, Table 1) not only causes the Great Head to sing its mournful lament, it also causes the Great Head to grind forward, revealing the staircase to 8-149. 

The Horns: The sounding horns are built into a carefully shaped ledge of rock that circles the western portion of the cave. Each ‘horn’ is in fact a careful piece of craftsmanship that incorporates an actual tusk or horn into cleverly and magically carved stone channels in the cave wall. Each horn is slightly different, with apertures/mouthpieces of varying size and material. In addition, each horn ‘plays’ a distinct note, although the note sounds from 
the appropriate lesser head. Working counter-clockwise from the upper right, the notes played by the horns are C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. For true music fans, it is possible to achieve a flatted or sharped tone by varying the embouchure used when sounding a horn.

The Wall of Songs: A 40’x10’ portion of southeastern wall of the cave was flattened by Eustachius, who used it as a sort of blackboard on which to experiment with ‘compositions’ or note sequences. Two lumps of whitish chalk lie invitingly on the floor by the wall, and a long-decayed step ladder sits nearby. Some remnants of Eustachius’s composing process are still legible on the wall. Two are notes written in a spidery Mithric hand: “Compose swiftly, or 
face appropriate action!” and “Repetition does not equal music.” One tonal sequence, named ‘Restorative’, is also fully indicated: EEF+EAA-. The start of a second sequence, tantalizing entitled “Eustachius’s Lament” is also present, although most has been erased: B-D-. For the effects of these sequences, see below. Full transcriptions of Eustachius’s Lament (aka the Cantor’s Lament) may be found at areas 3-57, 7-22, and 8-53.

The Lesser Heads: Each of the lesser heads is carved into one side of a rock pillar in the main cave. The heads vary in size, from 2’ (the G-head) to 5’ (the E-head) in height. Each is distinct in its facial features and expression, but all share a few features: 1) they do not resemble ‘normal’ Archontean sculpture, but instead appear more like the Olmec Colossal Heads (flat noses, wide eyes, thick lips); 2) whatever their expression, the lips of each are slightly pursed, allowing sound to emanate from within; 3) all are placed at a level 5’ above the cave floor. Each head is connected by magic to one of the horns, and, as a result, each head only sings a single note. 

Two of the lesser heads differ slightly from the others. The ‘F-head’ is not found on a free-standing pillar, but rather is carved onto an outcropping of the north wall of the cave. The ‘G-head’ is the most unusual, as it is carved into a pillar that rises from the center of a sinkhole extending 10’ below the level of the cavern floor (cf. the sinkhole below).

The Great Head: This colossal boulder located in the southern portion of the cavern has been entirely shaped into another Olmec-style head. It has two oval eyes, a flattened nose, broad cheeks, and thick lips open in an ‘o’. A band of some sort surrounds its head. The 
top of the boulder is flat. Via his sonic magic, Eustachius arranged it so that sequences of notes played by the horns and sounded by the lesser heads are sung forth in a melody by the Great Head. The great head’s melodies vary slightly, but are typically mournful. It sings in a deep but sonorous bass tone. Should the Cantor’s Lament be ‘played’ on the horns, the Great Head grinds forward, revealing the stairs to 8-149. The Great Head encases a giant chunk of arcanum (see new magic items); 3-12 turns of serious excavation on the head will reveal the arcanum.

The Sinkhole: The sinkhole around the G-tone lesser head is about 15’ in diameter and 10’ deep. The walls of the sinkhole are fairly sheer. At its base it opens into the tunnel network leading between 8-145 and 8-156. A noticeable breeze may be felt on the sinkhole floor, one that rises into the main cavern and helps activate the whispering fungus.

Effects Produced by Tone Sequences: As indicated above, sounding the horns in certain patterns produces ‘songs’ sung by the Great Head. As the possibilities for such composition are infinite, some guidelines for the GM are presented here. A few sequences are fixed, and produce the fixed effect noted below on Table 1. For all other note sequences, the GM must use some judgment. In general terms, Eustachius designed the system such that note sequences in major or ‘happy’ scales or modes produce positive effects, while those that are discordant or in minor keys/modes produce ‘negative’ effects. As players may not have much musical training or inclination, however, the GM has two ways to proceed when PCs produce a set of tones. If PCs hum a melody or even a specific song, the GM should judge whether that melody/song fragment is ‘positive’ or ‘negative’; the GM can then select whichever effect seems appropriate from Table 2. If the players don’t indicate a melody or song, or if they show little inclination to engage with the musical component, the GM can simply roll randomly to determine the effect produced by the PCs’ composition. 

Note: In Archontean notation, F+ is the same as the modern western F-sharp, while A- is the same as our A-flat.

Table 1: Fixed Effects of Certain Tone Sequences

The following effects are fixed (i.e., playing any of these sequences only produces the associated effect).

12 [HaEEF+EAA-ppy Birthday]

The Great Head chants a pleasing simple melody; all in hearing have 1-8 HP restored

13 [YCCDECED ankee doodle]

The Great Head hums a fast jaunty melody; marching speed of all increased by 30’ (i.e., from 90’ to 120’, or 120’ to 150’) for 2-4 hours

The Great Head sings a triumphant song for 10 minutes; all in hearing receive +2 to saves for 2-4 hours.

16 BABCDEC [So What]

The Great Head sings a repetitive loop that is highly syncopated. For the next 1-4 hours, whenever the PCs make a decision about which direction to take, the GM rolls it randomly as the characters ‘naturally’ don’t seem to care. No mapping is possible, either.

17 CBAGGCBCGG [Don’t Fear the Reaper]

The Great Head intones slow ominous tones. A pair of type III demons gate in to answer the

All doors in 8-147 open simultaneously

GM Note: The sequence called the Cantor’s Lament may be discovered elsewhere, at areas 3-57, 7-22, and 8-53.

There is a 25% chance that the phase spider in 8-156 comes to investigate sounds of human activity, but only if more than six rounds have passed without music from the heads. For stats, see 8-156.

Treasure:
The arcanum (see new magic items) within the Great Head is 5’ in diameter and weighs about 11,000 lb.

### 8-149: The Cantor’s Rest 

This cavern may only be accessed by playing the Cantor’s Lament on the horns/heads in area 8-148; doing so causes the Great Head to grind forward, revealing the stairs down to this area.

The square cave within was Eustachius the cantor’s private study and retreat. The walls are decorated with frescoes showing representations of aerodes (see new monsters), largely as shim-mering butterflies in iridescent colors. An oak desk carved to make it look as if it were made of actual branches sits against the south wall; on it are sheaves of sheet music. A hammock has rotted in place along the east wall, and a set of simple pine chairs and tables 
lies in the center of the chamber. The west wall boasts a rack with several musical instruments: three buccinae, a pair of cithara, three lyres, and two auloi. One of the cithara is Eustachius’s cithara (see new magic items), and one of the auloi is an aulos of frenzy (see new magic items). By the entrance hallway is a stone chest: inside the chest are the following: a pouch with eight golden yellow topaz gems (500 gp each); an unusual set of ebony Archontean chess pieces, in which each of the usual figures carries a tiny gold instrument (cithara, lyre, aulos, etc.) (the set is worth 4,000 gp); a stack of twelve ancient octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items); and a set of erotic earrings made of ivory and platinum (450 gp).

### 8-150: Leather-Making Cave

This cave smells strongly of decaying animal tissue. Four natural pools are found along its walls. In its center are four frames made of bone and wood. Muq (8-151) stretches animal skins on the frames after working them over in the pools. As a result the pools are rather filthy and smell quite badly. At the far end of the cave is a pile of bones and rotting viscera; most of the bones are those of small animals like goats, lizards, and snakes.

Treasure:
One of the skins stretching on the rack is a basilisk skin that Muq is preparing for Cinna Minux (7-122); that skin is worth 325 gp. The other three skins are more mundane, and might fetch 25-75 gp each.

## Level 8: 151 - 171

### 8-151: Muq’s Cave

The western corridor is blocked by a latticework of wooden sticks, vines, and bits of debris (so as to deny the rust monsters at 8-140 entrance to this cave). 

This cave is the home of an exiled lesser varumani (see new monsters) named Muq. More than fifteen ledges and niches are set into the walls of the cave, and Muq is adept at leaping between them (or from them!). He has two goats curing from hooks in the ceiling, and a pool of clear water in the northern niche. Hidden beneath a rock at the bottom of the pool is an iron box sealed with wax; in it are Muq’s few valuables. 

Muq lurks in the shadows on the wall, preferring to hide if visitors look dangerous. If discovered, he proves to be anxious and shifty, attempting to placate visitors with whatever information – even invented information – will get them to leave. He only fights if cornered.

Muq is a clan-brother and former friend of Gog (5-2); he provided false evidence to Varboka the thegn (7-30) implicating Gog in treason. Gog was duly exiled, but swiftly Muq was forced to flee as varumani public opinion turned against the snitch. Fearing for his life, Muq survives by spying for the vampire, Cinna Minux (7-122), who has charmed him and who brings him food and bits of information. Both Gog and Varboka would pay well for information about Muq’s location (or news of his death). 

Muq is afraid of Lugo and company (8-136), and would like to avoid them if possible.

Muq, the lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 56; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

Treasure:
In Muq’s sealed box are the following: a choker made of gold inset with onyx (2,200 gp); a pair of white pearls (100 gp each); a map of areas 7-10 to 7-33 etched on the back of a piece of leather, with area 7-31 marked with an ‘X’ and noted as ‘treasure’; a tightly-wrapped packet of documents that prove Gog’s innocence and Muq’s culpability. The documents would exculpate Gog in the eyes of Varboka, and are thus valuable: Gog has little money, but would prove a valuable and eternal friend, while the thegn would offer 2,500 gp for them.

### 8-152: Destroyed Weapons Stash

The northwest lobe of this cave contains two rickety wooden racks, each of which was once filled with spears. The spears, which are not uniform but vary in size and material, lie broken in pieces about the cave. Graffiti in Mithric is scrawled across the western wall of the cave: “Let the enemy take notice! They won’t be able to use this stuff now!” and “Marcus, optio X-S”. Any Archonteans would recognize the ‘X-S’ abbreviation as meaning the Xth legion of heavy infantry (scutarii); Marcus was an optio (minor officer) in this legion in antiquity. Beneath the spears are the bones of a heqeti hopper (see new monsters).

### 8-153: Headless Statue

A rather lumpish, headless statue stands near the entrance to this small, muddy cave. It depicts a being with a squat torso, thick thighs, and human-esque arms that each hold a spear. It is, of course, a heqeti hopper. The head was struck off in antiquity and is lost. As a curiosity the statue might bring 200 gp to the statue brokers (AV-22). Buried in the muck at the foot of the statue, however, is a heqeti spore bomb (see Arden Vul items), wrapped carefully in a piece of lizard hide.

### 8-154: Cave with Small Cliff

This cave is relatively flat and dry. A small cliff (30’ high) looks down from the southern corridor into area 8-156 (although a descending passage also allows access to that location). Signs of a recent feast are present: two skeletons of subterranean lizards that have been stripped of all edible meat and marrow, and a litter of empty stoneware jugs and bottles surround a small campfire. The fire is warm, but no longer active. The debris is a warning of the presence of the spriggans to the north.

### 8-155: Spriggan Trouble

The cavern is relatively flat, with a sandy floor; it is brightly lit by six torches thrust into the sand around its edges. Amid the torchlight six Arden Vul spriggans (see new monsters) are playing bocce with an assortment of skulls. They tethered their trained subterranean 
lizard to the floor while they play; the lizard carries thirty seven bottles of various sizes containing brandies, ales, and other liquors. The skulls are human, and one has two scrolls stuffed into it.

The spriggans were sent by a faerie lord to discover the fate of their comrades (7-62), who have been missing for more than a millennium. Displeased with the assignment, they are easily distracted and quite content to dilly-dally, play games, sing songs, and chat with visitors. Eventually, after urging any visitors to drink and play with them, the spriggans will ask about the fate of their lost colleagues. Should the PCs have useful information (such as 
their location), this group will part as great friends, promising to ‘put in a good word’ with all other spriggans; in this case, the spriggans can warn their new friends about the ‘demons who are not as they appear’ (8-119 to 8-120) and can suggest that the ‘shiny cave’ (8-157) has good pickings for non-spriggans. Should the PCs have killed the other spriggans and admit it, this group attacks immediately. If the PCs have no information to report, there is a 
50% chance that this group grows angry and attacks; otherwise they continue their game, ignoring the PCs. Should the PCs mention and/or sing the Green Silken Robe (see 7-62), these spriggans are impressed. They immediately drop what they’re doing and join in, singing for 2-8 turns. The chance that they attack drops to 10%.

Half of their number has become radicalized. As a result, they left the search party and can be found at area 9-99.

6 Arden Vul spriggans (see new monsters): SZ S or L; AL CN; AC 4 (5); MV 90’ (150’); HD 5 (8+3); HP 38 (63), 37 (62), 35 (60), 34 (61), 34 (59), 32 (57); #AT 1 (2); Dmg 2-5 (knife) or (2-12/2-12); MR 25%. Thief skills: PP 75%, OL 78%, FRT 70%, MS 77%, HS 64%, HN 35%, CW 81%, RL 40%. Special attacks: confusion 1/day. Special defenses: immune to poison, charm, and mind-affecting spells; healed by magic missiles. Special: grow to giant size; affect normal fires, faerie fire, trip, detect magic, shatter. 

1 trained, smallish (15’-long), subterranean lizard: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 37; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: double damage on a natural roll to hit of 20.

Treasure:
The alcohol is usable, or could be sold for 275 gp. The scrolls are a scroll of protection from earth elementals and a spell scroll containing Kentillian’s abyssal ice (see new magic items). Each spriggan carries a pouch with 25 sp, 75 gp, 15 pp, and a potion. The six potions are as follows: potions of fire resistance, undead control, treasure finding, the berserk, deafening light, and hostile levitation (for the last three, see new magic items). 

### 8-156: Spider Cave

A phase spider makes its home in this tall (20’) cave. The spider’s web runs across the upper register of the cave, allowing it to drop down on unsuspecting prey as they cross below. A number of dead starlings (6-13) lie on the cave floor; inspection reveals they have been drained of their bodily fluids. The spider has no treasure. Occasionally it visits area 8-148 through the sinkhole, but is intimidated by the music of the Great Head; only if the sounds of prey moving in 8-148 persist for 6 rounds without any music might the spider move to investigate (25% chance).

1 phase spider: SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’, 150’ in web; HD 5+5; HP 38; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: poison (-2 to saves). Special defenses: phasing.

### 8-157: Rudishva Retreat 

This large chamber is constructed in the usual rudishva style: all edges rounded, octagonal black granite sheathing tiles, and a very clean, minimalist look. 

A long, oval console and three stools stand against the east wall; all are made of white plasteel. In one of the stools is the desiccated corpse of a rudishva, still in his orange jumpsuit. The cause of his death is obvious, as a heqeti stone spear protrudes from his back. 
Three hammocks of sturdy flexible plastic hang from posts set into the curved northern wall. In one of them is a second corpse, also in orange jumpsuit and also bearing signs of violent attack. Five corpses of heqeti hoppers lie in the center of the chamber; they appear to have killed each other. 

By the east wall are several white plasteel racks holding numerous pieces of rudishva gear, all of it smashed and useless, as well as a closed and keyed troll chest (see new technological items). The troll chest is keyed to the hand of the third rudishva corpse (see below); were explorers able to open the rudishva iris door and slay the slime zombie, they could use the desiccated hand of the rudishva to open the chest. 

The door in the southern wall is a rudishva iris door, and only opens when a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque is presented (see new technological items). The t-shaped area beyond it is similar in appearance, although the southern corridor fragment ends in jagged rock. To the west and east are niches for rudishva teleport nodes. Lying inert in the southern extension is a valuable rudishva tool, a mobile stone cutter (see new technological items). 

Just inside the southern side of the door is the corpse of a third rudishva in an orange jumpsuit. The corpse’s flesh within the jumpsuit is coated by a rust colored, gluey, non-motile, flesh-animating heqeti slime (see new monsters). The corpse rises as a heqeti slime zombie (see new monsters) if warm-blooded life is detected within 10’. 

Backstory: Near the end of the period of rudishva hegemony, Captain Leil-Jor commanded three crewmembers of the Beacon to begin delving a new refuge here in the depths of the Nether Reaches. Those crewmen were overwhelmed and slain during the heqeti surprise attack, as the kaliyani let their heqeti allies use the teleporter near 5-122 (that once led to T21) to assault this region. 

The leader of this three-man team was infected by the heqeti slime, but managed to shut the rudishva iris door after the hoppers, trapping them in the northern portion of the room as they slaughtered his comrades. The heqeti eventually took their own lives when they could not find an exit. A later heqeti rescue party dug the tunnel that now connects this chamber to the surrounding tunnel network, but they were too late to save their fellows.

Teleport Nodes:
The two nodes are not functional, even though both possess the standard 5’-diameter silvery circle on the floor and the companion 10”x10”, rune-incised wall plaque. Both lead to areas that are now buried under tons of rubble. The western node (T21) once led to the now-destroyed kaliyani areas (near 5-122). The eastern node (T22) once led to an area with substantial arcanum and deuterium deposits that Captain Leil-Jor had just begun to develop 
in the months before the demise of the rudishva. Sadly, that new area suffered a cave-in in the intervening years, and the teleporter is thus currently inoperable. The new area provides a potential location for GM development; should the GM wish it, he/she could devise a new rudishva area to which T22 leads. T21: inoperable (once led to an area near 5-122)

T22: inoperable

1 heqeti slime zombie (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 4; HP 24; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: slime infestation. Special defenses: immune to electricity.

1 rust colored, gluey heqeti slime (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 0’; HD 2; HP 11; #AT 1; Dmg special. Special attacks: flesh-animating (covers flesh and kills victim in 4-7 rounds, then re-animates as a heqeti slime zombie - see new monsters); corrosive to leather. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.

Treasure:

Under the corpse and atop the console in the northern part of the chamber: a stun baton with rudishva lesser power supply (see new technological items).

On the third rudishva corpse: a silver rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items).

In the troll chest (keyed to the hand of the third rudishva): two rudishva breathers, a rudishva fire extinguisher, three rudishva stun grenades, a rudishva personal force shield, two full rudishva lesser power supplies, 30 Arden Vul cakes (see new technological items for all these items).

In the unfinished southern corridor: a mobile stone cutter with a greater rudishva power supply (75% charged) (see new technological items for both).

### 8-158: Heqeti Sign Mold

A patch of vermillion mold covers the southern half of this cavern. Motion with 10’ of the mold causes the mold to adjust its hyphae to reveal a pictographic message: a crude heqeti hopper with an arrow pointing east. The mold is, in fact, a heqeti sign-mold (see new flora), placed here ages ago to direct lost heqeti to the staging ground at 8-162

### 8-159: Crossroads Cave with Pukel-mander

This deserted cave seems to have been partly worked in antiquity, and several broken bits of primitive mining equipment are scattered around (shovels, picks, etc.). The southern extension contains the remains of a heqeti pukel-mander (see new magic items). The head of the pukel-mander has been hacked off and lies on the sandy floor; excrement has been shoved into its eye holes, and crude graffiti in Mithric covers its torso (sample: ‘back to the 
swamp, hoppers!’ and ‘teleport this!’). Needless to say the teleport function of the ‘mander no longer functions. A piece of dirty linen thread runs across the floor of the chamber, leading towards both 8-160 and 8-161.

### 8-160: Deserted Cave

A whiff of a breeze from the west may be felt in this cave. The desiccated bodies of a dozen starlings summoned in antiquity from 8-147D lie on the floor. A dirty linen thread snakes towards the east (8-159); it eventually leads to 8-161.

### 8-161: Cave with Secret Door 

One end of the linen thread found in 8-159 ends here, next to the corpse of an adventurer. The cave floor is sandy and shows much evidence of traffic, albeit very old traffic: drag marks, the footprints of heqeti hoppers, small bits of broken bone and stone, etc. A ranger notices this immediately; others have a 1 in 4 chance to spot the signs.

Secret Door (east): This rare heqeti secret door is normal to detect. Presenting a tear of Kauket (see new magic items) causes the door to swing open easily; otherwise, the door must be pried open using brute strength. 

Treasure:
The corpse of the human adventurer holds a flask of oil, a bandoleer of throwing knives, a broken staff, a bulls-eye lantern, and a backpack with 537 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), a pair of silver earrings shaped like heqeti hoppers (125 gp), four red spinel gems (100 gp each), and a scroll with the following magic user spells: wall of fire, extension II, and enchant an item.

### 8-162: Hidden Heqeti Staging Area

This chamber is roughly hewn from the rock. As with all heqeti areas, the walls are pebbled and slightly oily. On the east wall are three large pieces of graffiti in Mithric: “Death to the hoppers!”, “Life to the Xth!” [i.e., the Xth legion of heavy scutarii], and “We have disabled the damned wells. Let them try to flank us now!” The niches to the east hold heqeti teleport wells. A statue of a heqeti weaver stands at the north end, while several overturned equipment racks stand to the south. Broken equipment and the bones of numerous heqeti and humans line the floor. The bones come to life and attack once the room is entered.

Statue of Qisstep the Weaver:  Qisstep the Weaver was one of the architects of the heqeti defeat of the rudishva. The statue is 6’ tall and carved of granite, and shows Qisstep gesturing with a wand toward the secret door. As a weaver, Qisstep’s features are close to 
human, albeit with noticeable amphibian overtones: his legs are slightly thickened, his face is flattened face, and he has a slit-nose and slightly too-large mouth. Qisstep’s name is etched into the plinth in simple heqeti runes. 

Equipment and Bones: The shattered equipment mostly includes stone- or steel-tipped spears, with a smattering of wooden or stone clubs and Archontean gladii. The bones are jumbled, but come to life once the chamber is entered. Searching the debris for at least 
two turns produces several intact mundane weapons as well as several enchanted items. 

Heqeti Teleport Wells: Each well takes the form of a 7’-diameter circle of stone rising 3’ above the floor. Unlike other wells, which contain an inky blackness, these are void of magical effects and simply extend 10’ below the surface of the chamber floor. The bottom of each well, however, bears a carven image an amphibian head, with a 4”-diameter hole in the place of the mouth. The wells could be reactivated by dropping a tear of Kauket (see new magic items) into the appropriate mouth. If reactivated, the wells connect to 10-24.

10 skeletal wights (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 5+1; HP 38(x3), 35(x4), 29(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 3-9. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: successful energy drain heals 3-9 HP; +1 or better weapons to hit; edged weapons do ½ damage; immune to sleep, charm, hold, poison, paralyzation and cold; turned as ghasts. 

10 zhoul (see new monsters), from the legionaries’ corpses: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 30, 28, 28, 25, 25, 23, 23, 21, 21, 18; #AT 1; Dmg 3-12; MR 10%. Special defenses: immune to charm, hold, sleep, and cold; turned as ghasts.

Treasure:
Amid the litter: three intact heqeti spears, an intact stone club, a pair of fine gladii, Qisstep’s spear (see new magic items), an enchanted gladius (short sword +3), four tears of Kauket (see new magic items), and a heqeti spore bomb (see new magic items) concealed in a backpack (there is a 20% chance the spore bomb activates when/if the backpack is handled).

### 8-163: Cave with Concealed Door

This empty cave has a moist, muddy floor. The south wall is covered with another patch of vermillion heqeti sign mold (see new flora). Approaching it causes the mold to form two pictographs: a crude spear pointing west, and an image of a heqeti hopper.

The mold also covers a small (3’-diameter) hole in the south wall. The hole is a concealed entrance to the tunnel leading to 8-159.

### 8-164: Watery Cave

This 50’-tall cave is full of water up to a level 30’ above its floor. The tunnel to the south (towards 8-163) is found just at the water level. The tunnel to the north opens 10’ above the cave floor and is thus fully submerged; it slopes downward to 8-166.

The water is not fully stagnant, but is also not running. The surface of the pool is dotted with cave lilies (see new flora). The spores of the cave lily, of course, cause intense euphoria, making swimming among the lilies highly dangerous. Those swimming must either consciously say they are avoiding the lilies’s bulbs or roll 4d6 under DEX to avoid them. If a lily releases its seeds, those within 15’ must save vs poison or fall into a soporific state; in such a state they will immediately sink and will drown in 3-6 rounds unless pulled out by comrades.

This cave is part of the territory of the giant snapping turtle that resides in 8-166. There is a 25% chance that the turtle is present in 8-166 at any given moment. If not present, it will still arrive from 8-166 within 2-5 rounds if it hears noise (like swimming, or the bodies of anesthetized swimmers dropping to the cave floor). 

The turtle is immune to the cave lilies.

The floor of this cave holds a scattering of bones as well as some treasure from previous victims of the lilies and the turtle.

Giant snapping turtle (25%): see stats at 8-166

Treasure:
Two 5-lb bars of platinum (1,250 gp each); 2 darts of sleeping (see new magic items); and a jade cup of life restoration with 2 charges remaining (see new magic items).

### 8-165: Looted Tomb of Qisstep the Weaver

Secret Door (east): This door is normal to find. It hangs on a pivot and opens by pushing hard on its right side. 

A second, normal stone door leads to the tomb of the heqeti weaver, Qisstep. Tomb robbers will be disappointed, however, as the interior door rests crazily on its hinges; it was clearly broken down in antiquity. 

The original heqeti frescoes have been utterly destroyed, with images hacked out and various curses scribed (in Mithric) all over the wall (sample: “Lucius took a dump here!” and “May Osiris keep the slimy ones from passing the veil”).

To the south is a mortuary altar in the heqeti style, formed of red obsidian and with a shallow basin in which the ashes of the deceased were placed. Although no ashes are present in the basin, it seems that Lucius was true to his word. To the north is a statue of Qisstep, looking much like that at 8-162: he stands on relatively human-looking legs, and was originally pointing a wand at the door. The head and both arms have been knocked off, however. 

Amid the general debris and litter are several fittings marked with the Archontean numeral, ‘X’: it is a sign that a spathos of the Xth legion was quartered here briefly during the heqeti wars. 

For all of their destruction, the legionaries did not locate a hidden compartment in the plinth to Qisstep’s statue. The compartment is protected by an ancient poison needle (50% chance it still works): those stuck must save vs poison or suffering a wasting disease (CON diminishes by 1, and HP by 10%, each week until death or until the disease is cured). Inside the compartment is Qisstep’s ring (see new magic items) and a necklace made of jade, coral, and shark teeth (550 gp). 

### 8-166: Water-filled Chasm 

A deep chasm filled with cold, slightly stagnant water bisects this large cavern. The water-filled chasm extends 50’ below the floor of the western ledge; the eastern ledge is 30’ taller than the western one. The pool is filled with the strange fungi known as cave lilies (see new flora), whose spores cause motion-freezing euphoria. Swimmers must either move extremely carefully while consciously avoiding the bulbs, or successfully roll 4d6 under DEX to avoid 
touching a bulb. A burst bulb releases its spores in a 15’ radius, causing all within to save vs poison or sink into a catatonic state (and thereby probably drowning within 3-6 rounds).

The cave is also home to a large and very hungry giant snapping turtle that alternates hibernation with feasting on incautious spelunkers. The turtle is 75% likely to be present here (otherwise it will be in 8-164); it is immune to the cave lilies.

1 giant snapping turtle: SZ L; AL N; AC 5 (0); MV 30’, 20’ swimming; HD 10; HP 62; #AT 1; Dmg 6-24. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

##### 8-166a: Hidden Spring

Down the submerged tunnel is a spring that feeds fresh water into the caves at 8-164 and 8-166. The spring takes the form of a slow leak through a narrow crack, and is not traversable. 

### 8-167: Deep Cave 

The entrance ledge drops 20’ to the cave floor below. On the floor of the cave are the corpses of several animals who fell into this pit. Beneath them, and invisible to casual sight, is the skeletal corpse of an Archontean scholar who, having overindulged in wine, also fell 
into the pit and died of his injuries. The scholar still wears a ring of fire resistance and carries a small wooden coffer carved with scenes of Archontean justice. The coffer contains two rudishva breathers (see new technological items) and a slate tablet with the following notes, in Mithric: “The crystal guardians completely ignore us, save when we attempt to harvest the giant crystal columns. We need more resources, better defenses, and stronger protection 
against the environment within.” 

Treasure:
Two rudishva breathers (see new technological items).

### 8-168: Archontean Corridor Fragment

This worked section of hallway is palpably warm and humid. A plaque hammered to the wall reads, in Mithric: “Do not proceed past the environment veil without proper protection. Their language remains elusive. Those without authorization may be trapped.” Scholars in the late Archontean period began to finish this section of tunnel in preparation to a full-scale exploitation of area 8-169.

The northern niche contains a 5’-diameter circle of rose quartz set in the floor: the destination point for the teleporter at 8-7F. 

The southern passage is blocked by a special, permanent wall of force; it allows passage into area 8-169, but only allows passage back to 8-168 to those who know the password (“open”, in Mithric).

### 8-169: Crystalline Cave 

This huge cave is 80’ tall; the entrance ledge protrudes at a point 60’ above the cavern floor. The cavern combines several unusual geological features. First, it is extremely hot and humid (~130F and close to 100% humidity), making exertion quite difficult (movement halved, all combat rolls at -2). Second, colossal columns of light-orange-colored gypsum imbued with arcanum (see new magic items) crisscross the bulk of the chamber. Third, the cavern is filled with bathtub-hot water up to a point 20’ below the ceiling; explorers will need to swim among the giant columns to explore the cave. Fourth, six large (8’- to 10’-diameter) pockets 
of raw arcanum (indicated by capital As on the map,) are buried among the gypsum columns. And fifth, the infusion of arcanum in the gypsum causes the columns to give off a dull, orange glow. 

Amid the gypsum columns move four regular and two large selenite guardians. They politely request that intruders depart, although their language is utterly foreign and can only be deciphered by magic. Should intruders not depart within a turn, the selenite guardians move to defend their ‘garden’. 

4 selenite guardians (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 30’ on dirt, 60’ on selenite; HD 6; HP 41, 37, 36, 34; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/2-8. Special defenses: regenerate 2 HP/round near 
selenite; immune to fire and water; take only 1 HP from edged weapons.

2 large selenite guardians (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 30’ on dirt, 60’ on selenite; HD 9; HP 65, 59; #AT 2; Dmg 2-16/2-16. Special defenses: regenerate 2 HP/round near selenite; immune to fire and water; take only 1 HP from edged weapons.

Treasure:
Six large pockets of raw arcanum (see new magic items).The arcanum-infused crystalline columns can be distilled at area SL13-37 to form more raw arcanum.

The corpses of any slain selenite guardians produce 6-600 gp worth of selenite crystals. 

### 8-170: Tunnel to Unmapped Area

The destination of this tunnel is left to the GM to devise. It most certainly leads, at least indirectly, to a dwelling of the selenite guardians, deep below the earth. Perhaps it also leads to the subterranean realms of dwarves, gnomes, and dark elves? Of course, the tunnel can simply be a dead end if preferred.

### 8-171: Tunnel to Nowhere

Currently this tunnel ends in a cave-in. It does, however, provide the GM with an opportunity for expansion, should such expansion be desired. In such cases, the tunnel could lead to other, unexplored areas of the Halls, or even directly to the Underearth.
