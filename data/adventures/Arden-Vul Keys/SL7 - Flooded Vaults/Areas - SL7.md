## Overview

With the rise in the water level of the Drowned Canyon and the failure of the regulatory mechanisms installed by the cult of Thoth, much of this sub-level gradually flooded. While some areas are completely submerged, others are merely awash in several (4’) feet of water and even fewer areas remain dry (but damp). It is the home of a species of fishmen that is unique to Arden Vul (see new monsters). The fishmen move swiftly in the submerged and partly-submerged areas of the level, and are adept at using the system of wells to flank and surround potential intruders. PCs who visit the area will need to be strong swimmers and should possess some magical means of breathing or otherwise moving through water. 

The region is dominated by an insane rudishva survivor, the former xenobiology officer of the Beacon, Reiv-Tor. Already before the rudishva collapse Reiv-Tor was experimenting with bio-engineering, perfecting means of gene sequencing and splicing. He even claimed to be able to produce a ‘better’ rudishva, one that would be capable of resisting the toxic agents the crew of the Beacon had encountered in Arden Vul.

After he failed to convince his colleagues, he began experimenting on himself; one of the early successes was a cell flushing therapy (perfected in conjunction with the future Master 
of the Sun-Scarred Knights) that offered greatly expanded lifespans. 

After the collapse he found himself working for the Archonteans in a limited fashion from a laboratory created for him on Sub-Level 7; they knew him as ‘the necromancer’, even though he despised that term (and it was mostly inaccurate).

When the empire splintered, Reiv-Tor was poised to seize con-trol of this region. Doing so, his experiments in bioengineering rapidly accelerated in number and type. He became obsessed with the idea that water was the ideal medium for life and began altering his body to make it more suited for aquatic living. He also began mutating captured goblins, beastmen and humans into servitors – the fishmen. Approximately 60 fishmen inhabit the sub-level, and Reiv-Tor is always in the process of creating new ones.

Finally, he also created a few forms of unique life to help him restructure his environment to match his tastes; these include the coral generating fish, the lantern fish, and the spy fish. It was Reiv-Tor and his creatures, of course, who built up the dam in the Drowned Canyon (SL6-25).

Now Reiv-Tor is mostly insane, content to rule his aquatic domain from area SL7-23, while creating new fishmen servitors and gradually converting the stonework into coral. Reiv-Tor uses the fishmen to defend his domain, as well as to gather food and intelligence in the Drowned Canyon. Under his direction, the fishmen have constructed a series of wells and connecting tunnels which dot the level, allowing them to move rapidly between various points of the level.

Given the presence of his spy-fish through the sub-level, and the somewhat linear route that must be taken to Reiv-Tor’s lair (SL7-23), it is highly probable that Reiv-Tor will be aware of the approach of a party of PCs. His minions will be prepared in area SL7-22 to defend their master, as will Reiv-Tor himself with his final defense force in SL7-23.

General Construction Notes
* Archontean areas: all the worked areas were originally built by the Archonteans.
	* Chambers and corridors marked with ‘squiggly walls’ on the map have been transformed by Reiv-Tor’s coral generating fish.
		* In these areas (which can either be submerged or partly-submerged) the stonework has been coated by a chitinous residue that resembles fresh-water coral. It is rough and sharp in places and, while it follows the original contours of chambers in a general way, produces uneven walls, floors, and ceilings.

Important NPCs
* Reiv-Tor, insane rudishva survivor (SL7-23)

Environment
* Most of the original doors in this region were typical wood-and-iron constructions.
	* Given the dampness of the area, these doors are almost entirely ‘stuck’ partly open. A few exceptions occur; they are noted in the level key.
* All the areas of Sub-Level 7 fall into one of three categories:
	* Dry: typically at the margins of Reiv-Tor’s domain (SL7-5, SL7-6, SL7-9, SL7-10, SL7-12) or outside it (SL7-26 to SL7-38).
		* They do not feature any standing water, but are typically damp and moist, with mold and fungus growing. The fishmen visit, but do not prefer these areas.
	* Fully Submerged: water from the Drowned Canyon completely fills these chambers and halls, typically murky, silt-filled, and relatively warm.
		* Vision is 20’ at best. The fishmen know these areas intimately, and don’t suffer from vision issues while in submerged chambers.
	* Partly-Submerged: contain 4’ of standing water, murky, silt-filled, and warm.
		* The fishmen have no trouble in these conditions. Others treat it as +1x difficult terrain PCs, and take -1 to hit from the awkward conditions.
* Wells
	* Several areas in this level are accessible only or partly via a set of wells (see SL7-2, SL7-20, SL7-21, SL7-22, SL7-23, SL7-25 and SL7-27).
	* Most of the wells (those in SL7-2 are an exception) are similar in dimensions: 4’ in diameter, protruding 4’ above the floor, and formed of the ubiquitous chitinous coral produced by Reiv-Tor’s coral generating fish.
	* The wells are 35’ deep and filled with murky water. At the foot of each well is a 6’-diameter, fully-submerged, coral-ized tunnel leading to another well.

Access and Egress 
* To Level 4: tunnel at SL7-37, leading up to 4-76
* To Level 6: corridor at SL7-6, leading down to 6-153
* To Level 7: stairs at SL7-31, leading down to 7-119
* To Level 7: tunnel at SL7-9A, leading down to 7-148
* To Sub-Level 6: corridor at SL7-1, leading to SL6-39
* To Various Areas: Thothian teleportation ring (see new magic items) at SL7-30
* Teleport destinations on Sub-Level 7:
	* SL7-8: from teleporter at UP-11

## Sub-Level 7: 1 - 15

### SL7-1: Grand Corridor Connecting to SL6-39 (Submerged or Partly-Submerged)

* This corridor connects Reiv-Tor’s domain with the Drowned Canyon (SL6-39).
	* Once brightly painted, now only a few smudges of paint remain.
	* It is completely submerged in murky water between the Drowned Canyon and a set of stairs midway down its length.
		* North of the steep stairs, the corridor is partly submerged in 4’ of water.
	* In the northern section of the corridor, four niches contain marble statues of former archons of Arden Vul, now crusted with lichen, mold, and water stains. 
* A troop of fishmen (new) patrols the upper part of the corridor, near the statues.
	* They are quick to dive into the submerged section to confront intruders.
* The southern portion of the corridor contains various specimens of Reiv-Tor’s fish.
	* 33% chance combat in the southern part attracts the attention of the fishmen in SL7-11, who arrive in 2-4 rounds.  They have released the barracuda in SL7-12, who arrive one round after the fishmen.

	* The chamber is 25’ high, with a 4’-tall frieze in high relief running around the walls.
		* It depicts generic scenes of Archontean justice: arresting, imprisoning, trying, and executing malefactors.
	* Five daises rise impressively out of the water, four to the left and right and one (the largest) at the head of the chamber.
		* The four lesser daises have three broad steps leading out of the murky water.
		* The central dais rises 15’ with a set of stairs set into the rear.
			* Secret Trap Door (main dais): opens as a stuck door.  It leads down to a narrow corridor that climbs steeply to SL7-30. 
		* All daises once featured stone seats of justice.
			* Reiv-Tor had the chairs on the two daises closest to the door replaced with coral wells leading to the fishmen’s network of tunnels.
			* The remaining seats are impressive pieces of stone carving, with a hoplite helmet prominently featured on the seat back of each.
	* The chamber is a hive of activity for the fishmen.

	* Several sodden bits of wood rusted iron equipment litter the floor of the chamber.
	* A dead coral generating fish (new) floats near the ceiling, speared to death.

### SL7-4: Antechamber (Submerged)

* Coral generating fish have completely coated the walls and floor of this antechamber.
	* Only the ceiling remains uncoated, glowing brightly with continual light.
	* A magic mouth on the fourth stair booms forth (Mithric) when anyone passes.
		* “The Shrine of Unconquered Marius Beckons! Approach with Humility and Respect!”
		* GM Note: refers to the route from SL7-6 to 6-153, and thence to 6-154.
	* A rotting fishman corpse rests on the landing by the secret door to SL7-5.
	* Secret Door: easy to locate (1 in 4), opens when a rod is inserted into a pencil-thick hole, causing the door to grind open.
* Three giant groupers and a lantern fish wait in the murk.

### SL7-5: Secret Tomb of Marius’s Daughter (Partly-Submerged)

* The corridor from the secret door to the tomb of Kassandra, youngest daughter of Marius Tricotor (see 6-154), inclines gently upward.
	* The eastern end of the corridor and the tomb itself are partly-submerged in 4’ of murky water.
	* North wall: a high relief carving of a legionary holding the hand of a 5 year-old girl.
		* The legionary has close-cropped hair and gentle eyes, his expression one of tenderness. He wears battered legionary armor and carries a sheathed gladius.  A golden torc (100 gp) hangs around his neck; inscribed (Mithric) ‘A father’s love for his daughter.’
		* The girl has a pair of braids and wears a simple tunic; she looks up lovingly at the legionary.
		* The pair are the great Archon Marius and Kassandra, his daughter who died at the age of five.
		* GM Note: noting of the simple functionality of Marius’s gear depicted here may help those who find their way to the Shrine of Marius (6-154). 
	* Center: a red granite sarcophagus (8’ x 4’ x 4’).
		* Undecorated save for the name Kassandra inscribed on the heavy lid (as stuck door to open).
		* Inside are the bones of a young person, wrapped carefully in a linen shroud. 
		* Next to the body are five toys made of silver, gold, ivory, and ebony.
			* A horse, an Archontean legionary, a lion, a peddler (Larel One-Eye), and the goddess Isis.
			* Each has movable limbs and is a fine specimen of craftsmanship (150 gp).
		* If remains or toys are disturbed, the spirit of Kassandra manifests.

Spirit of Kassandra Tricotor
* Little Kassandra’s spirit has all the personality of a lively, mischievous five-year old girl.
	* Interests: play (hide and seek), tricks, baubles, stories, etc.
	* She has no combat abilities.  If her toys are removed from the chamber, she haunts the desecrator, constantly badgering for the return of her possessions and ceasing only when they are returned to the tomb.
* Kassandra can be a font of information about her father, some of it even useful.
	* If engaged politely but playfully in conversation, she reveals her perceptions of Marius’s personality (simple, honest, kind), his lack of interest in pomp and circumstance, his friendship with Lucius Cornelius Scriptor, and his victories against the ‘slimy hoppers’.  All this is presented from the viewpoint of a five year old.

### SL7-6: Stone Spearmen, with corridor to 6-153 (Dry)

* Two Archontean animated constructs (spearmen, new) stand against the east wall.
	* The corpses of five fishmen are strewn about the chamber.
		* Underneath one corpse, in the exact center of the chamber, is a mosaic depicting a compass.  By the arrow pointing ‘east’ is an image of a yellow hoplite helmet and the letter ‘M’.
			* GM: a clue that the shrine of Marius lies to the east, at 6-154.
	* The eastern corridor descends 225’ down numerous short staircases to 6-153.

2 Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 38, 33; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.

### SL7-7: Floating Bodies (Partly-Submerged)

* The door to this chamber is stuck narrowly open, a tight 20” crack.
	* Three corpses of fishmen float in the 4’-deep water of the entry hallway, savaged by claws and bites.
* The chamber proper was once a vibrantly-decorated sitting room for Archontean officials.
	* Now yellow and blue streaks of paint run down the walls, and a heavy, waterlogged set of oak furniture decomposes in the water.
	* Four more badly decayed-corpses of fishmen float in the water.
		* 2 are actually coffer corpses, which wait until one is inspected before attacking.

2 coffer corpses: SZ M; AL CE; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 15, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: strangle; fear. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm and mind-affecting spells, turn as wraith.
* strangle: if empty hand attack hits, it grabs the throat, chokes for auto 1d6 / round until destroyed or victim dies (Str 20 to break grip).
* fear: witnesses to surprise reanimation from dormancy save vs spell or flee 2d4 rounds

### SL7-8: Columned Hallway (Dry)

* Two rows of red granite columns support the ceiling of this dry, but humid, chamber.
	* A piece of living mosaic (new) is inset into the east wall, depicting SL7-22.
* Note: This hallway is a potential destination for the teleporter at UP-11.

### SL7-9: Barileon the Spectre (Dry) 

* The chief administrator (proedros) of the SL7 Archontean administrative center lived here.
	* It is dry, but smells musty. The walls are covered with faded and mildewy frescoes depicting Archtonean officials directing scribes, notarii, chartoularii, and so forth.
	* South end: a large (10’x20’) oak table; littered with parchment.
		* Most of the parchments are mundane requisitions of ink, parchment, cloth, leather, and other sundries. One incomplete quire, is 'Justification for the Ravatorus Project' (books).
	* North end: a rotting bed, oak desk, and pair of mouse-infested leather chairs.
		* Desk drawer (locked): Barileon’s necklace of office (platinum with a yellow gold pendant studded with emeralds, 8,500 gp).
* Barileon has returned as a spectre and floats near the ceiling, waiting to attack any who venture within.

Barileon the spectre: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 7+3; HP 49; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

##### SL7-9a: Tunnel to Level 7 and the Great Chasm (7-148)

* A 4’-diameter tunnel wends eastward from Barileon’s chamber, intersecting the Great Chasm at 7-148.

### SL7-10: Chamber of the Chartoularii (Dry)

* Nine desks and chairs crowd this chamber, stripped of their papers and valuables.
	* Extended and/or noisy searching here may draw Barileon the spectre from SL7-9.

### SL7-11: Fishmen Outpost (Submerged)

* The door to this coral-encrusted chamber is wide open.
	* Inside are eight fishmen sharpening spears, and a pair of large lantern fish.
	* If they hear noise in SL7-1 (33% chance) or are confronted, one swims for the door to SL7-12 to release the barracuda.
* A stout, 10’-thick column stands in the center of the chamber.
	* Carved in spiral fashion, it depicts the deeds of the late-period archon, Agapion, particularly his campaigns against a tribe of giants found west of Arden Vul.
		* Lesser quality work than in the golden age of Archontos, but is still easy to decipher.  Archontean legionaries attack a huge palisade and steading, fighting against giants with clubs and rocks, eventually the steading burns.
		* Agapion appears regularly as an elegant figure on horseback, pointing at the enemy with his baculus of authority.
	* For obscure reasons, the coral generating fish have not touched the column.
	* A secret compartment (detects as secret door) within the column open when a catch worked into the head of Agapion’s horse is pressed.
		* The compartment is 2’ square, containing a pale green ioun stone, a pearly white ioun stone, and the giant’s tooth (new).

8 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 234, 22, 20, 19, 18, 16, 15, 15; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club, spear or javelin); MR 10%. Special attacks: paralyzing mucus. Special defenses: immune to cold and poison.

### SL7-12: Barracuda (Submerged)

* The fishmen keep four fresh-water barracuda penned in this coral-covered chamber.
	* Both doors are shut, but not locked.
	* If the fishmen in SL7-11 hear intruders, or if they move to engage in SL7-1, a fishmen releases the barracuda to join the fray.
* The growing coral has destroyed any former decoration in this chamber. 

4 barracuda: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 300’ swimming; HD 3; HP 20, 19, 17, 14; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8.

### SL7-13: Old Torture Chamber (Dry)

* The door to this chamber is locked and stuck.
	* The last key is in the burial niches at SL6-70 (still requires forcible unsticking).
* Inside, the chamber is dry, albeit humid.
	* Six sets of manacles are attached to the south wall with chains and staples; each set holds a skeleton (2 human males, a heqeti, a varumani, an ogre, a human female).
		* All six are animate, chattering evilly but senselessly if the chamber is entered, attacking if released.
	* A spear gun with 6 spears (tech) sits in the northwest corner.
	* A long, 10’ x 4’ table occupies the center of the room.
		* The skeletal corpse of a rudishva still in tattered orange jumpsuit lies atop it, restrained by more manacles.
			* This was/is a rudishva security officer, Naik-Lir, apparantly inert. If manacles on wrists and ankles are released, he springs up as a giant rudishva skeleton (new).
		* Several severe wooden chairs are scattered about the table, and a dozen rusty and pitted torturers’ implements are scattered on the floor under the table.
		* A wooden pail sits on the table next to the rudishva corpse.
			* In it are 57 teeth (various species, stained with old blood), and a key ring to the manacles on the wall and the table.
				* One of the teeth is a tooth of Pol (new).

Naik-Lir
* Once freed it issues a booming challenge (Rudishva), demanding to know if its saviors are minions of Reiv-Tor (SL7-23).
	* If the answer (in Rudishva) is yes, he attacks immediately.
	* If the response is no or obvious incomprehension, he issues general threats and departs, making its way towards SL7-22.
* A diplomatic and respectful party might manage to converse briefly with Naik-Lir.
	* Reiv-Tor abandoned his people in their time of need to serve the humans.
	* Reiv-Tor is obsessed with creating new life forms.
	* In the last days of Archontean rule, Naik-Lir came to SL7 seeking to negotiate with the Archonteans and/or Reiv-Tor, but was seized and tortured to death.
	* Naik-Lir knows nothing of the current waterlogged nature of the area, nor of the fishmen or other aquatic species.
	* Naik-Lir has a good sense of the general location of Reiv-Tor, even granted the latter’s subsequent remodelling of the sub-level.
* GM Note: If allowed to leave without combat, Naik-Lir heads for SL7-16.
	* Being undead, he has no problem ‘breathing’ in submerged areas.
	* He easily defeats the fishmen in SL7-16, then moves to SL7-17 and down the corridor towards SL7-20, reducing the population in SL7-17, SL7-18, and SL7-19 (see notes in each areas) before being overwhelmed by the kopoacinth in SL7-20.

Naik-Lir, intelligent giant rudishva skeleton (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%.

### SL7-14: Fishmen Lair (Submerged)

* The door to this chamber is completely encrusted with coral and  stuck wide open. 
* Two coral generating fish are busily filling the rest of the chamber with spikes of coral that resemble stalactites and stalagmites.
	* They make the chamber difficult to navigate (+1x difficult terrain).

### SL7-18: Coral Face (Submerged)

* Six fishmen and numerous fish inhabit this coral-encrusted chamber.
	* On the south wall the coral takes the form of a woman’s face, 10’ in diameter.
		* This is a manifestation of Wadjet, deity of protection, whose shrine existed here in antiquity (hard to discern her identity from the rough coral depiction)
		* If Wadjet is beseeched here by name, she grants boons in the form of air bubbles that emanate from her coral ‘lips’ (3 boons / week, 1 per person).
		* The boons are 2’-diameter air bubbles, activated when the beseecher touches it.
* GM Note: if Naik-Lir was released from SL7-13, three of the fishmen here will be dead.

D6 Boon
* 1) Water breathing: the bubble fastens itself around the head of the beseecher. For the next 24 hours the recipient can breathe in water as well as air.
* 2) Blessing: the bubble fastens itself around the head of the beseecher. For 6 hours, the recipient is under the effect of a bless spell.
* 3) Fortitude: the bubble pops, but provides 6 hours of protection against fear (+4 to saves).
* 4) Righteous Anger: the bubble pops, but provides the recipient with +1 to hit and damage for 6 hours
* 5) Healing: the bubble pops, but heals 3-24 of damage on the beseecher.
* 6) Protection from water-based creatures: the bubble fastens itself around the beseeecher’s head. For 3 hours the recipient’s AC is improved by one versus all water-based or water-dwelling creatures.

### SL7-19: Still More Fishmen (Mostly Submerged)

* The murky water stands 15’ deep in this 25’-tall chamber.
	* Coral covers the floor and all the submerged walls.
	* A non-obvious ledge at the waterline on the north wall leads to dry chambers.
		* A sloping pile of coral against the north wall conceals a stairway that once led up to the ledge.
		* The door at the north edge of the ledge is locked and stuck (key long gone).
	* Eight fishmen reside here.

GM Note: If Naik-Lir was released from SL7-13, then 3 of the fishmen here will be dead.

8 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 24, 22, 20, 18, 16, 16, 15, 13; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club, spear or javelin); MR 10%. Special attacks: paralyzing mucus. Special defenses: immune to cold and poison.

### SL7-20: Crossroads Wells (Partly-Submerged)

* Five statues of winged, monkey-like beings sit on ledges set on the walls (two on the east wall, two on the west, one on the south, beside another, empty, ledge).
	* These are kopoacinth (water gargoyles), which swiftly attack any non-fishmen who enter the chamber.
* Three wells, each 4’ tall, 4’ in diameter, and made out of the ubiquitous chitinous coral, stand in the center of the chamber.
	* They are 35’ deep and filled with murky water. Via submerged, coral-ized tunnels 6’ in diameter, they lead to other parts of Reiv-Tor’s domain.
* 1 in 6 chance per turn that 1-3 fishmen emerge from one of the wells.
* GM Note: If Naik-Lir was released from SL7-13, his corpse will be floating in the water here (with his rudishva communication bracelet, tech).

5 kopoacinth (water gargoyles): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’, 150’ swimming; HD 4+4; HP 31, 28, 26, 25, 21; #AT 4; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6/1-4. Special defenses: Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit.

### SL7-21: Well Chamber (Partly-Submerged)

* Two coral wells occupy this chamber.
	* 1 in 6 chance per turn that 1-3 fishmen emerge from one of the wells.
	* Days spent chipping away the coral would reveal this chamber was originally connected to both SL7-20 and SL7-22.

1 in 6 chance for 1-3 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 20, 16, 15; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club, spear or javelin); MR 10%. Special attacks: paralyzing mucus. Special defenses: immune to cold and poison.

### SL7-22: Gateway to Reiv-Tor (Partly Submerged)

* This ancient Archontean meeting hall was one of the first to be modified extensively by Reiv-Tor and his fishmen.
	* Before their expansion into the rest of Sub-Level 7 this was the main residence for the fishmen, and it is still the only route to Reiv-Tor’s lair and lab.
* The ceiling rises 30’ above the floor.
	* Murky water sits 4’ deep on the floor; coral coats the walls from floor to waterline.
	* Four colossal (20' tall) statues loom, water stained and algae-encrusted.
		* Erected in the last century of Archontean rule in Arden Vul, they reflect the pinnacle of Archontean artistic hyper-realism.
		* Each (submerged) plinth is inscribed (Mithric) with the subject's name.
		* Manipulation of the statues is a puzzle, which can lead to treasure (see below).
		* Three prisoners are tied to the statues by ropes, awaiting transfer to Reiv-Tor’s lab for transformation into fishmen.
	* Three coral wells: two along the eastern wall, one in the center of the chamber.
		* The tunnel beneath the south-eastern well is unfinished. 
* Ten fishmen and assorted fish dwell here, guarding the approaches to Reiv-Tor’s lair.

Statues
* North: Alcibiades the Hunter
	* The famed hero Alcibiades, depicted in a huntsman’s leathers, leaning casually on his great bow while gesturing to the north with his left hand. His long hair is held back by a circlet.
* East: Phocion the Builder
	* A well-known (in antiquity) architect and planner of public works, Phocion leans against a half-column while holding a level and a set of dividers. Phocion has neatly trimmed hair and beard, and wears a simple tunic with a belt pouch (for Phocion’s tomb, see 8-142).
* South: Clandius the Centurion
	* The details of Clandius’s fame are lost to time. He points south with his gladius, while peering over his left shoulder (towards Phocion). His legionary gear is standard.
		* A fishmen’s woven bag is slung across his gladius, holding: 177 sp, 83 gp, a golden conch shell (230 gp), and three pearls (100 gp each).
* West: Marcion the Sorcerer
	* Dressed in a stiff-necked robe, Marcion glares ominously to the west, with twin wands held across his chest. He wears a skull cap and has pointed eyebrows.
* Puzzle
	* One of Marcion’s wands is removable (iron painted to resemble the statue's granite, detects as secret door).  If removed, it becomes apparent it is actually an arrow.
	* If the wand/arrow is nocked in Alcibiades’s bow, it activates a hidden catch (on Alcibiades’s leg, where the arrow/wand rests while nocked), that opens a hidden compartment concealed behind Phocion’s belt pouch.
		* Within: 10 alexandrites (500 gp each), a ring of water breathing (new).

10 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 24, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 13; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club, spear or javelin); MR 10%. Special attacks: paralyzing mucus. Special defenses: immune to cold and poison.

* Bartimaeus was one of Phlebotomas Plumthorn’s thugs (see 3-5) who fell out with his boss and went ‘exploring’ in Arden Vul. This proved to be a mistake, as he was captured by the Set Cult (Level 4) and then traded to the lizardmen (Sub-Level 5). He proved valuable as a scout, and accompanied the lizardmen to Sub-Level 6, where he was taken in an ambush. Bartimaeus has a good sense of the layout of Level 4 and Sub-Levels 5, 6 and 7.
* He has no equipment, and is roped to the statue of Alcibiades.

Petronia, 3rd-level female Archontean thief: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 3; HP 16, down to 7; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 9, INT 11, WIS 13, DEX 16, CON 9, CHA 15. 
Thief skills: 40%, OL 38%, F/RT 30%, MS 27%, HS 20%, HN 15%, CW 87%.
* Petronia was captured at the same time as Hall, while their party was exploring SL6. Her equipment is gone. She knows how to get from Level 4 to Sub-Level 5 (i.e., from 4-165 to 5-1), and thence to Sub-Level 6 (i.e., from SL5-47 to SL6-36).

### SL7-23: Lair of Reiv-Tor (Partly-Submerged)

* This vast, 25’-tall, circular chamber is the home and laboratory of the deranged rudishva, Reiv-Tor.
	* It is awash in water (4’ deep), with coralized floor and walls (to the 4’ mark).
	* A coral well rises 3’ from the floor in the center of the chamber, allowing access to the rest of Reiv-Tor’s domain via an underground, coralized passage to SL7-22.
	* Vestiges of an Archontean fresco run around the upper register of the chamber.
		* It shows a civic procession, with notables in togas carrying urns and small busts (of their ancestors).
	* The eastern stairwell descends to a completely blocked, rubble-filled hallway.
	* Nine huge cylinders line the northwest, northeast, and southeast walls of the chamber (see below).
		* Plasglass panels on their fronts allow access.  Tubes of bio-plas snake from each top to an 8’-tall plasteel basin burbling with yellow neuroderm (tech). 
		* Eight hold victims captured by his fishmen (3 human, one elf, five lizardmen), in various stages of transformation by the neuroderm.  The ninth is defunct.
* Here Reiv-Tor transforms sentient creatures into fishmen, while conducting other experiments about piscine matters.
	* He is typically assisted by 4 fishmen, and protected by 8 eels that swim freely in the warm waters of the chamber.

Cylinders
* Reiv-Tor brought the nine plasteel cylinders and the neuroderm basin from other portions of the halls during the collapse of the Archontean hegemony.
* Originally containment units for cryogenic storage (e.g. SL2-2), Reiv-Tor repurposed the cylinders to use in his transformation experiments.
	* Once in a tube, victims are beyond saving as the initial stages of the process destroy the subjects’ previous identities and memories.  For each victim, roll 2d6 to determine physical transformation and mental state.
* A plasteel console on the side of the basin is used to control the system.
	* The console has 3 buttons, a smoky grey-glass screen, thirteen 3” slots (six currently filled with bioplas genetic control modules), and a larger, 6”-wide slot.
		* Button 1) turns on the screen.  Screen touch-selects cylinder and genetic module(s) to apply.
		* Button 2) opens/closes the plasglass panel of a selected cylinder, draining neuroderm if necessary).
		* Button 3) activates the flow of neuroderm from the pool to the selected cylinder.

D6  Stage of Transformation
* 1) Early: feet webbed and enlarged
* 2) Early: feet and hands webbed and enlarged
* 3) Middle: feet andhands webbed, skin green but dry
* 4) Middle: feet andhands webbed, skin green and dripping
* 5) Late: feet and hands webbed, skin green and dripping, face partially transformed
* 6) Late: a full fishman (see new monsters)
D6  Stage Reaction
* 1) Catatonic. Will die of self-neglect in 4-7 days
* 2) Catatonic. Will die of self-neglect in 4-7 days 
* 3) Purposeless wandering. Moves in a random direction; takes no aggressive action
* 4) Purposeless wandering ina random direction; attacksif impeded
* 5) Attacks any non-fishmen immediately.
* 6) Attacks all those nearby immediately, mouthing wordless cries

Reiv-Tor
* Like his colleagues, the Arena Lord (6-85) and Psalor-Ki (5-74), Reiv-Tor is one of the few remaining rudishva from the Beacon.
* Just as insane as his former friends, Reiv-Tor has partly transformed his own body into an enormous fish-thing.
	* His green, scaly, skin drips ichor, while his feet and hands are elongated and webbed.
	* His head retains the characteristic horns of the rudishva, but is otherwise altered to give it a prominent, fin-like ridge in its center, plus flaring gills.
* Despite his fearsome appearance and his undoubted insanity, Reiv-Tor speaks multiple languages and knows quite a bit about the Halls.
	* 20% chance he negotiates with visitors.  He can offer explanations for the transformation of SL7 and might provide directions to the main public areas of Levels 3, 4, 5 and 6 (he knows nothing of tombs or secret chambers, though).
	* Reiv-Tor is utterly unstable.  50% chance per turn of negotiation that he decides to add visitors to his growing band of fishmen.

### SL7-25: Chamber of Bones (Partly-Submerged)

* The water that partly floods this small chamber is filled with bones. 
	* The bones are remains from the fishmen’s meals, mostly human and lizardman.

	* A balcony overlooks the east end; 10’ above the floor (6’ above the water).
	* A mound of detritus – muck, bones, and two collapsed pillars – occupies the middle of the chamber.
* Eight crocodiles inhabit the chamber, frequently resting on the detritus, but adept at striking from the water as well.

8 crocodiles: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 3; HP 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/1-12. Special attacks: surprise on 1-3.

* Another bi-level hall, the western end 10’ below the floor of the main chamber.
	* A new coralized well was dug by the fishmen in the western alcove.  The western section is now under 4’ of water.
	* The main section is dry and features eight beautiful blue-granite columns and a long central mosaic set between the columns.
		* Mosaic: episodes running from west to east depict the famous Labors of Arden (Labors 2, 3, 5 and 8, see Twelve Labors of Arden in books).
	* In the apse at the east end is a statue of Arden the warrior, dressed in legionary garb and resting on her famous spear.

* This small chamber served as an armory during the Archontean era.
	* There are ten racks for armor and four large weapons racks, though most of the equipment is gone.
	* The floor is littered with a 2’ layer of broken bits of metal and shredded pieces of leather (remains of the former equipment). 
		* Lost in the litter is a two-handed sword +2, and a set of imperial field plate +1 (av items).
	* Secret Door (north): opens when a spear haft is thrust into a hole in the ceiling, above the secret door.

### SL7-29: Tomb of Erdenion Thrice-Blessed (Dry)

* This 25’-tall chamber serves as the tomb of Arden’s last surviving relative, Erdenion.
	* The walls are painted cerulean blue, with frescos of a female archontean in various poses: leaning on a spear, thrusting her spear, casting a spear overhand, gesturing with a baton of authority, holding a set of judicial scales, strumming a lute.
	* To the north is a statue of Erdenion as a legionary leaning on her spear.
		* Painted to resemble the granite of the statue, the spear is really Erdenion’s spear (new), a potent weapon and needed to open the sarcophagus.
	* Erdenion's sarcophagus rests on a plinth in the center of the chamber; a massive piece of obsidian (10’ x 4’ x 6’).
		* An inscription in silver letters (Mithric) running along all four sides: “The famous warrior, Erdenion, beloved daughter of the line of Arden the Great, rests within. Touch not, lest you suffer the agony of all thieves.”
		* The sarcophagus is dotted with 1" holes (¾” deep, none penetrating the 4”-thick walls of the sarcophagus).
		* The lid is sealed by magic and can be budged only when Erdenion's spear is touched to the proper hole (3rd hole, 5th row of holes, west side).

	* Secret Door (north): difficult to locate (1 in 8) behind the crumbling wooden shelving.  Opens by force (as stuck door).

### SL7-34: Tomb of Grenfell the Elusive (Dry)

* This 30’-tall chamber has an impressive barrel-vaulted ceiling and a prominent sarcophagus on a raised dais.
	* Wall frescoes depict an orange-robed figure directing workers in construction projects, gesturing at an indeterminate monstrous figure with a wand, and whispering into the ear of an archon.
	* The lid of the sarcophagus lies shattered on the floor, with nothing but bones and tatters of cloth inside.
		* An inscription (Mithric) along the long side of the sarcophagus: “Grenfell the Great, as elusive as he was powerful.”
* The true sarcophagus (5’x5’x10’) is invisible, and is attached to the ceiling of the chamber. 
	* The lid of ebony wood (275 gp) is on the bottom, carved with the name Grenfell the Elusive, and slides into grooves in the stone sides.
