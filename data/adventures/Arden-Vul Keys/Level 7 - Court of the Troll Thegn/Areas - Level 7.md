### Overview

This level of Arden Vul occupies a substantial area to the south and west of the Great Chasm (7-3). It is most notably the location of the court of Varboka, First Thegn of the varumani (7-30), a figure known to almost all non-varumani as “the troll thegn”. The Troll Lift (7-1) is the main access point from Level 7 to the upper levels. Visitors to the level can approach in peace provided they have one of the troll thegn’s passports (see Arden Vul items); these objects allow access to the hotbed of rumors, machinations, and plots that run through the thegn’s court (7-75) as well as to the famous Troll Market (7-76), where all manner of strange goods are bought and sold. Beyond these well-traveled and relatively safe areas lie the dwellings of the true varumani (to the east of the market), and the caves of the bestial varumani, aka Arden Vul trolls (to the west). A few isolated and unknown areas unconnected to Varboka’s domain are scattered about the level, including a set of Archontean shrines 
to the west that have become the lair of a powerful and secretive vampire (7-119 to 7-130), a forgotten route to the Sub-Level 9 (at 7-111), the engine room of the Beacon (7-143), a second rudishva floating island (7-4 to 7-7), and the lost upper temple of Kauket, which unbeknownst to the varumani has been recently restored by a heqeti builder (7-78 to 7-84). 

The varumani form the most powerful faction in the Halls. And yet, despite their clear physical and numerical superiority, the varumani remain fairly cloistered, preferring to endlessly practice their physical skills within the safety of the clan-holds. Ultimately the modern varumani are a collectively cautious and wary people, even if individual members are typically brave and well-trained. They are also a people in decline, a fact that has become painfully obvious to the thegn and his advisors. Today only about 100 true varumani remain, along with perhaps 170 lesser varumani and an indeterminate number of bestial varumani. To fend off this slow decline, the thegn is now actively interested in promoting procreation and also in seeking the origins of his people, namely by ‘activating’ the fabled ‘Beacon’ as a method of restoring their diminishing people. 

In addition to this agenda, Varboka and his people have been shocked by the recent revelation that the kaliyani have returned to Arden Vul; a varumani hunting party surprised and slew a kaliyani scouting team sent by Rivvep (9-118) to explore the chasm floor. As a result, Varboka has publicly announced a bounty on kaliyani fangs, worth 100 gp per fang. Varboka hopes to swiftly discover the location of their ancient enemies, and to then mount a major expedition to destroy the kaliyani “once and for all” (this plan would also cement Varboka’s status as one of the great thegns). If the varumani are viewed as hostile by visitors, the level will prove a substantial challenge in terms of combat tactics and attrition. If negotiation is preferred, though, the varumani can provide much valuable information and even a bit of assistance. Indeed, Varboka may even seek to employ capable-looking visitors 
for his own purposes.

Significant Regions of Level 7

Domain of the Varumani
* areas 7-1 to 7-77, 7-91 to 7-106
* The central region of this level is the territory known as the ‘domain of the thegn’, that is, the home of the varumani. By virtue of their racial strength and natural abilities, as well as their innate cultural predilection for discipline and loyalty, the varumani are clearly the most powerful faction within Arden Vul. The region is defined by clear defensive choke-points that the thegn keeps well-guarded (e.g. 7-1, 7-38, and 7-65). A frontal assault from either direction brings immediate and well-organized reaction, as scores of highly trained varumani muster to repel a threat. For peaceful visitors, possession of a troll thegn’s passport (see Arden Vul items) is necessary to enter the domain. 
* When visitors initially approach the domain of the varumani, the GM must first determine whether one of several special varumani gatherings is taking place. If a special gathering is indicated, it will determine the location of a large portion of the varumani. Roll on the table to determine this important fact: 
	* D100 Ritual
		* 01 Moot (see 7-27)
		* 02-07 Audience (see 7-27)
		* 08-09 Cleansing of Sorrows (see 7-32)
		* 10 Victor’s Right (see 7-32)
		* 11-100 No special ritual
* The starting location of Varboka, the troll thegn (see 7-30) is also necessary to determine. Varboka spends much time moving through his domain, pressing the flesh and making executive decisions. If, of course, the previous d100 roll indicated that a special gathering was under way, then Varboka will be present in at the location required for that gathering (either 7-27 or 7-32). If no special gathering is underway, then the following table determines where Varboka and his housecarls (7-29) will be when the PCs arrive on Level 7.
	* D100 Location
	* 1-5 7-13
	* 6-12 7-27 
	* 13-32 7-30
	* 33-35 7-32 
	* 36-65 7-73
	* 66-95 7-74
	* 96-100 Moving about Level 7
* Factions
	* The varumani control this region fully. Representatives of other factions visit respectfully, either to pay suit to the thegn or to visit the Troll Market (7-76).
* Construction
	* The worked areas are in the varumani style, but are very old, since they were built by the first generations of varumani fleeing the collapse of the rudishva hegemony. Ceilings are 12’, doors are typically wood with steel supports.
* Environment
	* The region is warm and humid due to the high population density.

Heqeti Upper Temple (areas 7-78 to 7-84)
* This region is defined by the lesser ziggurat of Kauket and surrounding heqeti regions. Cleansed by the rudishva in antiquity, it has been newly restored by a team of heqeti under the tongue Caudatssa (7-79). It has ancient resonance for the heqeti, as prior to the arrival of the rudishva it was a major center of heqeti civilization. With the retreat of the Archonteans and the shrinking of the varumani population, the heqeti deemed it a fortuitous time to restore this temple. As yet the upper temple exists in a somewhat precarious position, as it lies next to the varumani domain and is far from any potential heqeti reinforcements.
* Factions
	* The heqeti control this region. Its proximity to the domain of the varumani, however, has caused Caudatssa to be circumspect in announcing their presence, let alone in seeking expansion.
* Construction
	* The worked areas are of ancient heqeti construction.
* Environment
	* Area 7-78 is under the effect of a hallow spell, such that chaotic evil creatures gain +2 on all rolls, while good-aligned creatures suffer -2 penalties.

Domain of the Vampire
* areas 7-119 to 7-132)
* This set of ancient Archontean shrines and administrative chambers is now the domain of a powerful vampire named Cinna Minux (7-122). Due to his enhanced charm abilities, Cinna has been able to gather a ‘court’ of followers over which he presides as lord and master; these subjects include some lesser vampires as well as some charmed adventurers and monsters. Cinna also maintains an extensive network of charmed informants in other areas of Arden Vul.
* Despite his powers, Cinna is cautious. In particular he does not wish to cross the Sun-Scarred Knights (Sub-Level 10), nor does he wish to alert them to his location; as a result, Cinna keeps tight control on the comings and goings of his minions. For this reason, few denizens of Arden Vul know of Cinna’s existence, let alone the location of his lair. Should PCs stumble upon his lair by chance, Cinna is instantly aware of the intrusion and swiftly organizes a counter-attack and ambush.
* Factions
	* No faction controls this area and, indeed, few know of its existence. The bestial varumani (near 7-91) know only that this area is haunted.
* Construction
	* All the worked areas were built in the Archontean style. Ceilings are 10’ tall, doors are iron-bound wood.
* Environment
	* The area features the typically cool and dry conditions of the Halls.

## Level 7: 1 - 15

### 7-1: The Lower Troll Lift, up to Level 6 (6-5)

This chamber hosts the lowest terminus of the network of Troll Lifts on the western side of the Great Chasm. Here one can take the lift up 200’ to area 6-5. The chamber is formed of rough-carved stone, with polished blue granite tiles on the floor. Four highly detailed, 4’-tall, high-relief carvings of grinning varumani heads line the walls. The door to the south is locked and carefully watched. A pair of disused iron bars are set into the granite near the edge of the chasm (an out-of-commission cross-chasm ferry stop).

Domain of the Varumani: The chamber marks the main entrance to the domain of Varboka, the troll thegn, and is thus a necessary waypoint for those seeking entrance to the thegn’s court (7-75) or the Troll Market (7-76). Trijax, the true varumani vice-overseer of this section of the Troll Lifts, presides over a team of two bestial varumani and six ogres. Trijax immediately accosts those arriving from above (6-5) or the Chasm (7-3) in a gruff but neutral manner, demanding their business. Absolutely no one is permitted through the southern door without a special permit from the thegn, and those seeking access to the west will need to clear customs. 

Trijax is a tough old warrior and likes nothing more than to mix it up with those who prove ‘lippy’; he will, of course, send one of the ogres for reinforcements from 7-75 in the case of a real fight. If visitors are deferential to Trijax, however, and offer him a small gratuity (5 gp/person), he proves utterly willing to negotiate. Trijax can provide useful information about the court, the market, and local politics. Despite his gruff, macho demeanor, Trijax is 
surprisingly articulate and speaks fluent Archontean.

Customs Checkpoint: Those seeking to pass from 7-1 into 7-72 (in order to visit the court at 7-75 or the market at 7-76) must show at least one troll thegn’s passport (see Arden Vul items). If a party has no passport, they are almost always out of luck and must either return to 6-5 or seek their fortunes in the Chasm. If no other visitors are present (see below), there is a 20% chance that Trijax will be willing to furtively sell the party an extra passport. 

Stone Heads: The varumani like to paint (and repaint) the four heads; currently their faces are yellow, their long noses are blue, their eyes are black, and their hair is brown. The lesser varumani have given each face a name, as well: (clockwise from north) Smiley, Bubba, Junior, and Grim. The face on the south wall (Junior) is actually the destination point for the teleporter from 4-167. Since no one has used that teleporter in generations, Trijax and Co. will be astonished and impressed by any who arrive at 7-1 via that method (+15% reaction rolls).

The Troll Lift: The lift is unassuming at this end. No winch mechanism exists here, nor even a framework. Rather, on this end the only sign of the lift is a black square, 12’ per side, that has been painted on the floor at the point where the wood-and-iron cage from 6-5 (usually) lands. Passengers descending must wait until the cage has bumped the floor before disembarking and presenting themselves to Trijax for inspection. Those seeking to travel up (to 6-5) must first offer proper payment to Trijax (10 sp/leg). If the cage is present (33% chance), Trijax shouts up to Gorlen to activate the lift, and passengers reach 6-5 after 11-20 rounds. If the cage is not present, potential passengers have to wait 3-4 turns for it 
to appear; the trip up will take the usual amount of time. A troll chest keyed to Trijax stands against the west wall, under the face of ‘Grim’.

Treasure:
Troll chest (see new technological items): 14 ancient octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items); 137 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items); 879 sp; 211 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items); 731 gp; Trijax’s silver baton of authority (250 gp); a scroll with a schedule of shipments on it; another scroll with a list of names [those proscribed from using the Lift]; and a clay tablet inscribed with an image of Vanara (the legendary varumani leader – see 5-139).Trijax carries an embroidered silk purse with his own personal stash: 179 sp, 47 gp, and a gold sunburst medallion that he confiscated from a traveler (375 gp).

### 7-4: Large Floating Garden

This floating garden is a larger version of the floating island found on Level 6 (6-4). Three ‘hills’ dot the island, each stone at its core but covered with earth and humus and planted with a variety of flora. The spray from the northern waterfall conveniently waters the garden. 

The garden is brightly-lit, warm and humid. Two dozen rudishva light globes (see new technological items) emit the light and heat that enables the plants to grow. Doors into the hills are hidden by thick overgrowth of vines, moss, and grasses. The rounded sides of the north and south hills (areas 6-4 and 6-6) appear as shiny black surfaces across which vines and creepers trail; they are, in fact, one-way windows that are opaque from the outside. A pair of corroded iron frameworks occupy the southeast and southwest edges of the island; these were part of a cross-chasm ferry that the thegn abandoned when the island and Nether Reaches (Level 8) became too dangerous.

Unlike area 6-4, which is relatively well-tended, this garden is wild and dangerous. One threat is an enormous assassin vine, whose main root is sunk into the loam of the central hill (its location is marked with the letter A). Another is the six retch plants that appear as globular palm-like trees (marked with the letter B). Three triflower frond plants (marked C on the map) complete the dangerous flora. Two giant pedipalpi roam among the plant life. 

One of the creepers provides a succulent, coral-colored fruit that is edible and refreshing; denizens of the halls call it the pink delight (see new flora). A small orchard of six trees drop edible nuts, known colloquially as the delver’s reward (see new flora). Other edible plants may exist here at the GM’s desire.

A large troupe of baindara (see new monsters) inhabits the island. The baindara have constructed a nest on the underside of the floating island out of dense pockets of twisted creepers and vines; its inaccessibility protects them from the pedipalpi and any wandering chasm cephalopods. The baindara chatter angrily and hurl nuts and fruit if disturbed; despite their fearsome appearance, they are cowardly and flee to their nest if threatened. They only fight if cornered. 

1 assassin vine (see new monsters): SZ S (effective); AL N; AC 8 (main plant), 4 (tendrils); HD 8 (main plant); HP 53 (main plant), 5 (tendrils); #AT 24; Dmg special. Special attacks: drag; strangulation; digestion.

6 retch plants (marked B): SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 0’; HD 6(x3), 5(x34); HP 32, 30, 28, 25, 24, 22; #AT nil; Dmg nil. Special attacks: 5-8 fruit causing nausea; odor from broken fruit.

3 triflower frond plants (marked C): SZ M; AL N; AC 9; MV 0’; HD 2+8; HP 21, 19, 17; #AT 2-8; Dmg special. Special attacks: tendrils cause slumber; enzymes cause 2-8 HP/rd; other tendrils cause 1-6 HP/rd.

2 giant pedipalpi: SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 4+4; HP 30, 28; #AT 3; Dmg 1-8/1-8/2-8. Special attacks: grip; poison gas.

30 baindara (see new monsters), typically in groups of 5: SZ S; AL N; AC 8; MV 150’, 150’ gliding; HD 1-1; HP 4(x5), 3(x10), 2(x10), 1(x5); #AT 1; Dmg 1-2.

Treasure:
Up to 25 specimens of pink delight, and 3d20+120 delver’s reward nuts (see new flora for each).

### 7-5: South Observation Facility

* An iris door (sky blue or better) leads to this rudishva observation station and lounge.
* The interior is filled with trash, 2 plasteel stools (25 gp), numerous scraps of metal (and a copper identity plaque), piles of rotted vegetal matter, and 2 rudishva skeletons.
	* The walls are stone, save the curved, southeastern wall (a one-way window with a nice view of the chasm).
	* A plasteel control panel with knobs, dials and panes of dark glass, sits underneath the window; badly damaged by fire and corrosive substances.

### 7-6: Rudishva Teleport Nodes

* This iris door opens to a silver or yellow identity plaque. 
* Teleport Nodes:
	* A silvery disk inset on the floor and a silvery square is inset on the wall.
	* T16: access to 6-162
	* T17: access to 7-110

### 7-7: North Observation Facility

* An iris door (sky blue or better) leads to this facility.

The interior is also analogous to its counterpart, but is in a better state of preservation. 

An operations and control panel stands against the curved one-way window (north wall); it has numerous dials, knobs, and dark-glass panels.

Slumped against the panel are two dead rudishva in tattered orange jump suits.

Five orange-colored amphibianoid corpses lie amid the plasteel lounge chairs and settees.

The corpses – of heqeti – are now heqeti slime zombies (see new monsters).

Attached to the ceiling are two heqeti slimes (see new monsters). 

While most of the electronics have failed, one knob and screen combination still work.

Turning the knob causes the screen to illuminate and display the upper temple to Kauket (7-78); given the recent heqeti refurbishment of that area, numerous heqeti will be visible in the scene.

Most usefully to the viewer, the screen also bears a flickering set of Rudishva glyphs that read (if translated!): “300’ SSW.”

Treasure:
One of the rudishva corpses holds a laser pistol (with an empty lesser power supply) and has a sky blue plastic rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items for both). There are two rudishva dart throwers among the debris; they contain clips with 2 and 1 ordinary darts. The other rudishva corpse carries a synthetic pouch with 50 moonstones (60 gp each).


5 heqeti slime zombies (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 4; HP 28, 27, 26, 25, 24; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: slime infestation. Special defenses: immune to electricity.

1 sickly-green heqeti slime (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 5’ creeping; HD 2; HP 13; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6; MR 15%. Special attacks: flesh-eating for 4-7 rounds; corrosive to metal. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.

1 burnt-orange heqeti slime (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 6; MV 5’ creeping; HD 2: HP 12; #AT 1; Dmg special; MR 15%. Special attacks: flesh-animating (covers flesh and kills 
victim in 4-7 rounds, then re-animates as a heqeti slime zombie - see new monsters); corrosive to leather. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.

### 7-8: Antechamber to the Varumani Hold

* This antechamber is a visitor checkpoint to the varumani domain to the east and south.

Unusual sconces with globes of ambient continual light are attached to the south, east and west walls.

Three true varumani and two bestial varumani stand guard here at all times; they are 90% likely to attack non-varumani on sight. 

When those with a legitimate need and official approval (from the thegn) to visit the varumani hold appear in the antechamber, one of the true varumani shouts across the chasm for the vibro-bridge to be activated. 

Secret Door (west): This large (9’x4’) door is normal to detect. One opens it by pulling down the sconce on the west wall.

3 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62, 59, 57; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed swords; ring mail.

2 bestial varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 50, 49; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; immune to poison.

### 7-9: Chasm and Vibro-bridge

A small (50’-deep) chasm separates 7-8 and 7-10.

A rudishva-era vibro-bridge is set between the two worked areas.

When it is extended, it appears as a 2’-wide strip of buzzing blue energy.

Despite its appearance, the bridge is harmless and safe to cross.

### 7-10: Vibro-bridge Control

* An extremely bored lesser varumani is posted in this niche.
	* She activates the vibro-bridge across the chasm by pulling a lever on the wall.

1 lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 57; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting 
magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

### 7-11: Point Defense Array Controls

Only the thegn (7-30), his housecarls (7-29), and the court sorcerer (7-22) know of this chamber. This area contains an important piece of rudishva technology salvaged by the varumani when they fled from Level 5. A stone table holds a portable control unit for the four rudishva point defense arrays concealed in area 7-76 (the troll market). The portable point defense controller (see new technological items) is attached to a rudishva greater power supply (see new technological items). It requires an operator’s key-card (copies are held by the thegn Varboka [7-30] and Ashoka, the court sorcerer [7-22]) to activate. The controller has a single screen divided into four sub-screens, plus four switches, two dials, 
and four joysticks. The screens are connected wirelessly to cameras on the point defense arrays; currently that means they reveal most of area 7-76, each from a slightly different perspective. While the arrays are fully automated, and can used as such in several modes 
(motion-sensitive, sweep, arc-control, etc.), the joysticks allow manual control as well. 

Underneath the stone table is a pile of 19 depleted greater power supplies. The power supply that is attached to the controller has only 30+3d100 hours of power remaining; recognizing this, the thegn normally leaves it unconnected to the controller so as to husband its power.

Secret Door (east, to 7-12): The secret door is easy to find (1 in 4), but hard to open without the key (copies are held by the thegn and the court sorcerer). 

Secret Door (west, to 7-76): This door is also easy to detect (1 in 4). It opens when a 1”-diameter object is thrust into a small hole in the ceiling of the corridor.

GM Note: The controller is an extremely dangerous device. Of course, without an operator’s key-card, it is useless. But with the card and up to four point defense arrays, it could be used to inflict devastating damage on large numbers of enemies. Indeed, it was the main reason why the thegn was able to annihilate the Archontean expedition led by Adrienic 230 years ago. It could also be used on Level 10 to aid those assaulting the ziggurat of Kauket (10-32).

### 7-12: Lower Hall of the Thegns

This 20’-tall grand hallway is broad, clean, and brightly lit (via continual light spells cast on the ceiling). Six niches break up the dark grey of the walls. In the niches are statues of some of the early thegns; the statues are 10’ tall, marble, and carved in an enthusiastic if somewhat clumsy style. Despite their mediocre quality, the varumani love and revere them; indeed, they dress them up with bright, loose clothing and paint their eyes, noses, and ears. The effect is garish. From north to south, the statues depict these thegns: 

Penda, 4th Thegn
Gadila, 6th Thegn
Kubala, 7th Thegn
Rideya, 9th Thegn
Nakula, 10th Thegn
Girvala, 31st Thegn

At the foot of Girvala is the badly-mummified head of Tulliaros, polemarch of the Archontean II Legion (Sheepshead Rangers), still wearing the gilded helmet of a polemarch (for his empty tomb, see 5-21). Tulliaros was slain with most of his men in area 7-76 during 
the ill-fated expedition to retake the Halls some 250 years ago. The exarch in Narsileon (see World of Archontos appendix) would pay up to 1,000 gp for the return of the head (and helmet). Stealing the ‘sacred relic’ incurs the automatic enmity of all the varumani.

Secret Door (northwest, to 7-11): The secret door leading to this chamber is normal to find, but hard to open without the key (copies are held by the thegn and the court sorcerer). Only the thegn (7-30), his housecarls (7-29), and the court sorcerer (7-22) know of this chamber.

Treasure:
Head of Tulliaros the polemarch (1,000 gp), with gilded (but usable) Archontean helmet (125 gp). One of the pieces of cloth used to decorate Penda’s statue is an ancient lemon-yellow cloak of resistance +2 taken from poor Tulliaros’s body.

### 7-13: Porch of the Thegn

Beyond the 20’-tall wooden double doors the thegn’s porch looms over the cavern of the troll market (7-76).

The porch proper is sheathed in marble and boasts two basalt columns carved with images of varumani struggling with heqeti.

The porch is 25’ above the floor of the cavern, and is brightly lit by two rudishva light globes mounted on 6’-tall iron spikes (see new technological items).

Despite its impressive appearance, the thegn almost never uses the porch, preferring to use the greeting hall (7-74).

There is a 5% chance that Varboka is here with his six housecarls.

Varboka, the troll thegn (5%): see stats at 7-30.

6 varumani housecarls (5%): see stats at 7-29.

### 7-14: Hunters’ Lodge

The elite varumani confraternity of hunters has its headquarters in this chamber. The 15’-tall chamber is dimly lit with huge tapers made of (smelly) rendered animal fat. The chamber is filled with stuffed and mounted monster heads: a jaguar, a yeth hound, an ogre, a guardian of Thoth, a heqeti weaver, a heqeti hopper, a frost ghoul, two fishmen, a dog-brother beastman, a fungal forester, a Set deacon, a giant rudishva skeleton, and an entire giant four-
armed baboon. Amid all the trophies, eight hammocks are slung from the ceiling. By the doorway is a weapons rack, and three chests rest in the northeast corner. A set of heavy black velvet drapes blocks the eastern alcove, in which hang numerous sides of meat. An enormous cauldron steams in the center of the room; the hunters use it to rend the fat from their prey in order to make tallow candles. Three wooden chests carved with various animal and monster images dot the chamber. 

 At any given moment 4-6 of the hunters are present in the lodge, skinning hides, sharpening blades, and drinking crude mushroom wine. The hunters are widely respected and feared for their independent ways. Winning their friendship is likely to convey significant advantages upon any seeking to negotiate with Varboka the thegn. That said, the hunters are among the smartest and most ruthless of the varumani, and are more likely to attempt to kill those they encounter in the wilds than they are to befriend them. Among the better-known members of the confraternity are Nolgi and Livod, each of whom has a 5% chance of being present. 

 One of the senior and most-respected members of the confraternity, Bedara, has been missing for a month. She had been scouting rumors of a new danger on the chasm floor (the aroksachaul at 9-50 - see new monsters) when she was ambushed by a heqeti strike force; she is now suffering perpetual torture in area 10-8. Nolgi, in particular, would very much like news of Bedara; he and the others would proclaim eternal friendship to those who rescued Bedara.

 The hunters have their own shortcut to the Dread Risers (7-2): a set of hand- and foot-holds carved in the chasm wall and extending from the concealed door down 50’ to the Risers. They have hammered a series of iron hooks, pitons, and pulleys into the rock to allow them to hoist their catch from the Risers to the concealed door. 

Secret Door (north): The door is easy (1 in 4) to locate. It swings soundlessly on a vertical pin; a successful open doors check pushes it open. The door leads to a narrow passage and a concealed door that gives forth onto the chasm. 

4-6 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword; ring mail.

Livod the hunter, a true varumani (see new monsters) (5%): SZ L; AL LE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10, or 6-24 (trident, 2-20+4), or 8-26 (javelin +2). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: a huge trident; 7 javelins +2; ring mail; a thick gold torc (465 gp); a pouch with 76 sp, 112 gp, and two doses of hunter’s friend (see Arden Vul items). Livod’s ring mail is decorated with dozens of trophies, that is, scraps of hair or hide from his successful hunts. 

Nolgi the hunter, a true varumani (see new monsters) (5%): SZ L; AL LE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 8-26 (spear +2, 2-20+6). Special defenses: 
surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: a two-handed spear +2; an enormous mace; a heavy crossbow with 24 bolts; ring mail; two copper arm bands carved with images of heqeti (175 gp the pair); two doses of hunter’s friend (see Arden Vul items); a pouch with 111 sp, 78 gp, and two doses of hunter’s friend (see Arden Vul items). Nolgi wears a decorative helmet formed out of a couple of heqeti skulls, to which he has attached some streamers of colored cloth.

Halti the hunter, a true varumani (see new monsters) (5%): SZ L; AL LE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 8-26 (two-handed sword +2, 2-20+6) or 7-25 (javelin +1). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, 
confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: a two-handed sword +2; a net; a sheaf of 5 javelins +1; ring mail; a collection of 15 bangles of gold and silver (550 gp for the collection); and a purse with 87 sp, 131 gp, and two doses of hunter’s friend (see Arden Vul items). She affects a bright yellow phrygian cap (at least when she is not stalking prey).

Treasure:
Each hunter has his/her own personal weapons, some of which are enchanted.

Weapons rack: two two-handed swords, a two-handed axe, a heavy boar spear, a halberd, and two heavy crossbows

Mounted monster heads: each (except the Set deacon) could be sold to collectors in a large city for 100-400 gp each.

Chest 1: 2 lb of Gethite lotus powder in sixteen 2-oz pieces, stolen from traders on the chasm floor (100 gp per ounce) (see new flora); 4 vials of heqeti acid drawn from fresh corpses; 8 doses of hunter’s friend (see Arden Vul items); 11 doses of varumani knock-out juice (see Arden Vul items); 3 potions of waterbreathing; 2 potions of extra healing; and a potion of human control.

Chest 2: 374 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items); 298 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items); 1,149 sp; 357 gp; and 19 ancient octagonal platinum pieces (see Arden Vul items).
Chest 3: 4 pieces of ivory from a variety of unusual beasts (225 gp per piece), a weretiger pelt (300 gp), four sable pelts (100 gp each), and 3 teeth from a gold dragon (100 gp each).

### 7-15: Larder

The varumani store a wide variety of useful items here.

Numerous dried colossal mushrooms, harvested from the chasm floor, hang from the ceiling, as do already-cured sides of meat.

Stone bins hold the following: salt, barley flour, wheat flour, dried beans, mixed nuts, lard, and oil.

A pair of armoires hold prosaic items, including a 50% chance for any item from the standard equipment list.

Buried at the bottom of the bin of dried beans is a cursed loadstone (stone of weight). 

## Level 7: 16 - 30

### 7-16: Mess Hall and Kitchen

The hall is brightly lit with continual light. A 10’-long and 5’-tall stone table occupies the center of the room; on it sits a Nutri-Vore 2000 food generator (see new technological items). As the thegn has announced that the varumani stock of communal power supplies has been exhausted, however, the Nutri-Vore 2000 is currently not operable; should a power supply be attached to it, of course, it would again be capable of producing Arden Vul cakes (see Arden Vul items). The thegn is aware of a few privately-held power supplies, but is not in a position to confiscate them and, in truth, feels that the few remaining supplies are better used elsewhere. Still, should a new stock of power supplies come into existence, the thegn will be happy to win plaudits by re-connecting the Nutri-vore 2000.

Around the rest of the chamber are wooden trestle tables and benches. Hanging on the west wall are two enormous casks of water. There is a 50% chance for 2-12 varumani to be present in the mess hall, jovially eating, drinking, and singing songs.

1-6 lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 61, 60, 59, 58, 57, 54; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

1-6 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 61, 59, 58, 57, 55, 55; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: 
surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword. 

Treasure:
Nutri-vore 2000 food generator (see new technological items).

##### 7-16a: Kitchen

Two diva ogres reign as the resident cooks.

Their domain contains several wooden work tables, a fireplace against the north wall (with vents to the chasm), a stone basin for washing, and a cabinet full of plates and cups.

The niche to the far east is rough carved, and contains a 3’-diameter hole which leads down 5’ to area 7-34.

The cooks use this as for waste disposal; not surprisingly, it smells foul.

2 ogre cooks: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 25, 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

### 7-17: Rudigaya Clan Quarters

The members of one of the ancient varumani clans –the Rudigaya – dwell in this chamber. The chamber is 30’ tall and boasts typical, if ancient, varumani construction. Five towering stacks of barracks-style bunks dominate both the north and south entrances. These stacks are 10’ long, 4’ wide and formed of very old orange plasteel. Each stack has seven bunks in it. In addition, the walls of each corner or ‘wing’ of the chamber have an additional seven bunks carved in each. In total there are 98 bunks. The middle of the chamber, a 20’x30’ rectangle, is open, and provides living space for the clan. The central, open area is brightly lit, while the bunk stacks are in shadows. The walls are regularly painted in a bright cerulean blue.

The Rudigaya is the smallest of the four clans, and despite the grand size of the chamber it is home to only 19 true and about 20 lesser varumani. At any given moment 50% of the clan is likely to be present here, sleeping, relaxing, or plotting. 

Benches border the central living space. To the east are a several tables, with dice, game boards (chess), scores of clay mugs, and a large keg of cold water. To the west are a pair of targets used in dagger and javelin practice, a sanded wrestling pit, and three clan chests. 

 The northernmost table contains several codices bound in heqeti hide: A Rudigaya’s Best Friend and Success (see Arden Vul books), plus a tome of understanding.

9 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 63, 61, 60, 59, 59, 58, 55, 53, 50; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special

The chests are unlocked and open to all clan members. Among them are a total of 9,159 silver pieces; several dozen throwing daggers made of a variety of substances, including six 
daggers +1 and a non-magical dagger with a hidden venom injector in the hilt; 8 vials of poison of varying toxicity; a crude but surprisingly useful Rudishva Glyphik-to-Heqeti dictionary; four coils of silk rope; three clips of narcotic gas darts for a rudishva dart thrower (see new technological items); three empty rudishva lesser power supplies and one 
full one; 5 copper, 3 bronze, and a brown rudishva identity plaques, a brown plastic plaque and a pink plastic plaque (see new technological items); and a dozen Arden Vul cakes (see Arden Vul items).

### 7-18: Vanaraya Clan Quarters

The basic orientation of this chamber is comparable to that of 7-17, at least in terms of the bunkbeds and general layout. The walls are painted a soothing ochre color. 

The Vanaraya were traditionally the first of the clans, given their descent from Vanara (see 5-139). Currently they have lost some of their status, and have only 18 true and 31 lesser varumani members. About 50% of the clan is present in this chamber at any given time. 

Benches border the central living space. The center is occupied with four large tables pushed together, on which are dice, game boards (backgammon), scores of clay mugs, and a double-sized keg of Hak’s mushroom ale (30 gp; see 7-94). To the west is a wrestling pit and weapons rack along with three chests. The rack contains three two-handed swords, two large battle-axes, two halberds, two rudishva dart throwers (but with only 2 clips of ordinary darts – see new technological items), four ballistic batons (see new technological items), and a sheaf of 12 javelins. To the east is a pile of randomly sized pieces of wood, string and rope, bits of metal and plasteel, and so forth. This is a construction zone, where the Vanaraya experiment with new engineering projects. Currently the area contains a set of 2’-tall pillars connected by string (a model for an improved troll lift apparatus), and a set of 6’-long sliding, interlocking bits of colored plasteel (a portable bridge that extends up to 15’). Amid the tools and projects is also a rudishva security encoder (see new technological items), used to code troll chests to a new handprint. 

9 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 63, 61, 60, 59, 59, 58, 55, 53, 50; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special 
defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword.

16 lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60, 59, 59, 58(x3), 57(x3), 55(x3), 54(x3), 51; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed axe +2; ring mail +2.

6 varumani infants, 2 of which are true (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LN; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 26, 25, 21, 20, 19, 17; #AT 3; Dmg 1-2/1-2/1-6. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 
in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.

Treasure: 
Chests 1 and 2 are unlocked and open to all clan members. They contain a total of 6,479 silver pieces, plus 36 small bits of carved plasteel, ivory, and bone in a variety of shapes (worth 5 gp each to a collector of art naïf), a pair of large silver platters embossed with a sheepshead and the Archontean numeral II (GM Note: plunder from the massacre of Adrienic’s expedition; see 5-18 et seq.), worth 125 gp each; 3 bolts of silk (purple, yellow, and blue) worth 250 gp each; 2 tokens of Arden (see Arden Vul items); numerous worthless objects of daily life (cups, mugs, IOUs, small knives, etc.); and several rudishva identity plaques: three copper, a brown, two bronze, a pink, and an orange plaque. 

Chest 3 is a troll chest (see new technological items) keyed to the hand of Vedreya One-Eye, the current clan chief. Inside are complete maps of the entirety of the varumani areas of Level 7 (areas 7-1 to 7-76); the chambers on the maps are neatly labelled by function in Varumani Semi-glyphik. Also in the chest is the helmet of Vanara, a rudishva battle helmet (see new technology) with special significance to the varumani in general and to the Vanaraya in particular. Affixed to the inside of the helmet is a carefully folded bit of parchment with an accurate sketch of the non-secret areas of the Midnight Road (areas 5-86 to 5-137, not including 5-99 to 5-104). Finally, Vedreya has a stash of 2 fully-charged lesser power supplies (see new technological items) that he’s saving for emergencies.

### 7-19: Sorcerous Practice 

This space is where the varumani sorcerers hone their spellcraft, mainly by casting spells at each other.

For obvious reasons the area is bereft of valuables or possessions, since they keep being incinerated, destroyed or otherwise damaged.

Several life-size targets have been painted on the walls: two are kaliyani in different poses, one is a heqeti hopper, and the fourth is a human dressed in archaic imperial field plate.

The walls, ceiling, and floors, bear numerous scorch marks and scars.

The northern niche has a barrel in which a variety of charred, snapped, and broken sticks.

One of the charred sticks is actually a rod of beguiling (13 charges).

Provided they are not required elsewhere, there is a flat 10% chance that the sorcerers are practicing some spells.

If that is the case, the court sorcerer, the first adept, and all the apprentices will be present here.

There is a 10% chance that the court sorcerer, the first adept, and all the apprentices are here (see stats at 7-21, 7-22, and 7-24).

### 7-20: Niche with Summoning Circle

* Within the niche is a 10’-diameter solid silver (335 gp worth) summoning circle and 5-pointed star inset into the stone.
	* 5% chance the sorcerers have summoned a type I demon to the circle.

1 type I demon: SZ L; AL CE; AC 0; MV 120’, 180’ flying (Class C); HD 8; HP 57; #AT 5; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-8/1-8/1-6; MR 50%. Constant effect: infravision. Special attacks: cause fear; darkness 5’ radius. Special defenses: half damage from cold, electricity, fire, and gas. Special: levitate; detect invisible objects; telekinesis; gate a type I demon (10% chance). 

### 7-21: Apprentices’ Quarters

Although this 10’-tall chamber is filled with five bunkbeds, enough for 10 apprentice sorcerers, the varumani have only identified five youth with the aptitude for magic. The apprentices have painted a large caricature of Ashoka next to the door; whenever they are feeling abused they adorn the painting with funny objects, including mice on string, odd-looking mushrooms, and ordure. A communal chest holds a dozen varumani-sized robes of rough wool, as well as the apprentices’ spell books.

Secret Door (north): The apprentices are ignorant of this door. The door is 5’ tall and wide and is difficult to locate (1 in 8). It opens by pushing it inward.

### 7-22: Ashoka, the Court Sorcerer

The powerful and influential varumani court sorcerer, Ashoka, resides here. The large chamber has a hammock in the northwest corner with a troll chest (see new technological items) under it, a large work desk in the center, a scroll and codex cabinet by the door, and an alchemical apparatus to the south.

As a member of the Rudigaya clan, Ashoka is constantly being pressured by his clansmen to manipulate the thegn; he is firmly loyal to Varboka, however, and has refused such overtures. Ashoka is highly intelligent and a keen judge of character; Varboka relies on him in almost all decision-making.

The alchemical apparatus is valuable (750 gp); mixed in with the retorts and glassware are several potions, including potions of the berserk (see new magic items), clarity (see new magic items), growth and polymorph.

In the cabinet are several magic user scrolls and a few rare codices. The scrolls are of stinking cloud, extension I, ice storm, magic jar, monster summoning III, and reincarnation.

The codices include: the Ancient Ones, by Laelius the Praetor; Dogmatics of Father Set; Pandects of Thaumaturgical Visitation; Planar Dwellers and their Powers, by Nominus Obscurus; “Property of Eustachius the Cantor”; and Thoth in all his Forms (see Arden Vul books for all).

Inside the troll chest (see new technological items), which is keyed to Ashoka, are Ashoka’s spell book, a 6’-long ‘string’ of silver, coiled like solder; 3 lb of arcanum (see new magic items); gold and sapphire Sortian eyes (see new magic items); a leather sack with 451 sp and 399 gp; a silk pouch with four black opals (1000 gp each); a pair of gauntlets of fire absorption (see new magic items); a human-sized guard cap (see new magic items); and a 
packet of immobilizing mesh (see new magic items).

Secret Door (south): This door is difficult to discover (1 in 8). A keyhole exists in the pavement in front of the door; only Ashoka has the key, but the First Adept (7-24) knows of the door’s existence.

Ashoka the Court Sorcerer, a true varumani (see new mon-sters), 12th-level magic user: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 5-11 (staff of the magi 1-6+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 12th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: keys to areas 7-11, 7-23, 7-28, and 7-67; a sky blue rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items); an operator’s keycard for the weapons controller in 7-11; a rod of absorption; and a staff of the magi (21 charges). Memorized spells: comprehend languages, detect magic, identify, sleep; continual light, detect evil, levitate, ray of enfeeblement; dispel magic, fireball, slow, suggestion; confusion, monster summoning II, remove curse, wall of fire; conjure elemental, contact other plane, telekinesis, wall of force; monster summoning IV. 

Ashoka’s Spell Book: All standard first level spells; all standard second level spells; blink, clairaudience, dispel magic, fireball, gust of wind, haste, hold person, fly, invisibility 
10’ radius, item, lightning bolt, monster summoning I, slow, suggestion, tongues; charm monster, confusion, dig, dimension door, extension I, hallucinatory terrain, ice storm, monster summoning II, polymorph other, remove curse, wall of fire; cone of cold, conjure elemental, contact other plane, interposing hand, magic jar, monster summoning 
III, telekinesis, wall of force; forceful hand, globe of invulnerability, monster summoning IV, stone to flesh.

### 7-23: Sorcerer’s Secret Chamber

The existence of this hidden chamber is known only to the Court Sorcerer and First Adept, but the only key is held by the former. 

The chamber is rough carved. Its only decoration is a large slogan painted on the south wall: “The Truth Can Hurt. Keep This Secret!” A stone table stands in the center of the chamber. On it sit two incredible treasures that the court sorcerers have kept squirreled away for centuries. The first is the Testament of Vanara (see Arden Vul books), and describes in detail the collapse of the rudishva hegemony, the treachery of Rudiga, the death of Druva, and the wanderings of the varumani. It describes the passage from 7-28 to 5-141, and clearly describes Vanara’s resting place. Making the contents of the Testament widely known to the varumani would cause serious repercussions at the thegn’s court: 1) the Rudigaya clan would be shamed, and its members marginalized; 2) the harmony of the varumani society would be broken, leading to factionalization and infighting; 3) expeditions to reclaim Level 5 would be mounted almost immediately. For political reasons, therefore, a long succession of court sorcerers has kept the Testament secret from even the thegn.

The second treasure comprises two incredibly rare Priscian texts, the Hidden Codex and a heretofore unknown portion of the Fragment (see Arden Vul books for both). Information derived from the texts would be extremely valuable to the Archontean authorities in Narsileon or the modern Priscians (at areas 9-58 to 9-64 and elsewhere). Ashoka has correctly intuited from these texts that Isadora’s resting place is nearby, and he would like to locate it (GM: the location is SL11-19).

### 7-24: Glif, the First Adept

This chamber is the abode of the First Adept, the second most important sorcerer at the varumani court. The current First Adept is Glif, a lesser varumani. Glif has had the chamber painted a cheery yellow, over which she likes to practice painting images of monsters and other Arden Vul denizens. Images of chasm cephalopods, subterranean lizards, carcass creepers, and one of Kerbog Khan’s basic exploration automatons are visible. If guests ask about the automaton, Glif reveals that she encountered it at 8-62 (“in the Nether Reaches, in one of the ruined corridors north of the troll lift”). Glif has a hammock, an ordinary wooden chest, a work-table, a scroll case, and a gagged Priscian attached to the north wall with manacles. 

Ashoka shocked the thegn’s court by appointing Glif as First Adept, as there has never been a lesser varumani in any position of sorcerous importance (and, indeed, only a handful of lesser varumani apprentices over the centuries). Glif is certainly worthy of the post, however, as she is extremely intelligent and possessed of a keen insight into varumani psychology. She plays up the ‘dumb’ lesser varumani stereotype, and wears ‘primitive’ attire, including a mountain lion head and pelt as a cape, but is in truth one of the most canny varumani of them all. Despite Ashoka’s trust and her obvious ability, Varboka is a bit off-put by her. Glif is quite the explorer, and has been known to accompany members of the Hunters’ Lodge (7-14), and especially Nolgi, on expeditions to the Nether Reaches (Level 8).

Glif also has an imp as a familiar; it goes by the bizarre name ‘Elliott’.

The Priscian prisoner is named Noredden. Glif and Nolgi encountered Noredden in the Nether Reaches. After slaying her conversi, they captured her and brought her back to the varumani court for interrogation. Noredden has thus far revealed little, and Glif and Ashoka are growing frustrated; more advanced torture is imminent. The sorcerers are seeking specific information on the access points to the Priscian areas (9-58 to 9-64), and details of its layout. The thegn fully supports the sorcerers’ efforts, as he worries about the existence of a powerful force in an unknown location. Varboka is unaware that Ashoka is also interrogating Noredden with the hopes of extracting information about a hidden tomb connected with the Sortians (i.e., the Tomb of Isadora at Sub-Level 11). Unfortunately Noredden knows nothing of that tomb, nor even much about Isadora. 

Glif, the First Adept, a female lesser varumani (see new monsters), 8th-level magic user: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 57; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 9-14 (short sword +4, 1-6+8). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and 
other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: keys to 5-28 and 7-67; a gold Sortian eye (see new magic items); a rudishva useful palm (of correction) with 2 charges (see new magic items); a wand of secret door and trap detection (73 charges); and a short sword +4. Her memorized spells are: comprehend languages, feather fall, Frigg’s flatulence (see new spells), magic missile; levitate, Pol’s endless sneezes (see new spells), the pummeling fists of Arak-Zhorr (see new spells); dispel magic, haste, lightning bolt; confusion, wall of ice.

weapons to hit; immune to fire, cold and electricity; save vs magic as 7 HD creatures. Special: polymorph self (to animal form); detect magic; detect good; detect magic; invisibility; regenerate 1 hp/round, suggestion 1/day.

Noredden Galesdottir, 7th-level female elf magic user: SZ M; AL LN; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 7; HP 12 (max 22); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 9, INT 18, WIS 15, DEX 16, CON 10, CHA 13. Noredden’s spell book was destroyed when she was captured.

Treasure: 
In addition to the items carried on her person (see above), Glif ’s chest contains: a full set of beautiful black silk robes embroidered with dragons, which she wears in private (75 gp); a pouch holding 10 black pearls (500 gp each); a sack with 357 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) and 121 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items); another sack with 7,456 sp and 3,718 gp; 3 lb of arcanum (see new magic items); and her spell book.

Her scroll case contains the following scrolls: find familiar, suggestion, locate object, wizard lock, conjure elemental, polymorph self, and remove curse. The work area has a fine 
map of the western areas of Level 8 (areas 8-1, 8-3, and 8-27 to 8-46), lacking only secret doors; strewn about it are Noredden’s Priscian chain mail, Sortian baculus (imbued with blink), and Priscian gladius +2 (see new magic items for each).

Glif ’s Spell Book: Burning hands, charm person, comprehend languages, detect magic, feather fall, find familiar, friends, Frigg’s flatulence (see new spells), identify, light, magic missile, read magic, shield, spider climb; continual light, detect evil, ESP, invisibility, knock, levitate, locate object, mirror image, Pol’s endless sneezes (see new spells), the pummeling fists of Arak-Zhorr (see new spells), pyrotechnics, stinking cloud, web, wizard lock; clairaudience, dispel magic, gust of wind, haste, hold person, lightning bolt, slow, suggestion, tongues; confusion, dig, dimension door, fire shield, minor globe of invulnerability, polymorph self, remove curse, wall of ice.

### 7-25: Pendaya Clan Quarters

The basic orientation of this chamber is comparable to that of 7-17, at least in terms of the bunkbeds at the east and west ends and the open common space in between. The walls are painted bright yellow; the Pendaya have added large purple rings (symbolizing fidelity) with the letter ‘P’ on them (in Varumani). 

Despite a slight inferiority complex at being descended from a varumani who was not one of the original three thegns, the Pendaya are currently powerful and self-satisfied. They maintain a roster of 21 true and 37 lesser varumani members, although only about 40% are present at any given time, eating, resting, and generally having a good time.

Benches border the central living space. Three long trestle tables abut the north wall. A sanded wrestling pit is to the south. The current chief of the clan, Gavra the Easy-Going, is interested in wrestling and physical skills, and thus the common area has a web of ropes connected to the ceiling, neighboring bunks, and iron bars set into the walls. The clan uses this apparatus to practice climbing, jumping, and general fun. ASeveral weapons racks rest 
against the south wall, along with two clan chests and a stand holding Gavra’s personal armor (ring mail +2). The weapons racks hold six halberds, six two-handed swords, two huge clubs, three two-handed axes, a score of javelins, 2 rudishva dart throwers (see new technological items), and six clips of darts (2 immobilizing, 2 explosive, and 2 narcotic).

Should combat break out in the clan room, 25% of the varumani who are present will take to the ropes and attempt either to use missile weapons or to drop down on opponents from above.

### 7-26: Druvaya Clan Quarters

The basic orientation of this chamber is comparable to that of 7-17, at least in terms of the bunkbeds at the east and west ends and a 20’x30’ open space between them. The walls are painted in electric green spotted with bright silver ‘suns’. 

The Druvaya clan is the least interested in politics; its members are always more interested in a good, clean fight. The clan is currently composed of 22 true and 46 lesser varumani. Many of the Druvaya are found as guards elsewhere, however, so the clan hold is not particularly crowded. At any given time about 9 true and 18 lesser varumani are present in the chamber, sleeping, relaxing, or good-naturedly beating each other up. Their clan-chief, Igrippa the Unruly is frequently found here, clowning around with ‘the boys and girls.’ 

Battered benches border the central living space. A solitary trestle table stands to the north. It has a number of sharp daggers thrust into it (for the knife game), while a score of cheap clay mugs are piled near a double-sized keg of Hak’s mushroom ale (30 gp; see 7-94). The bulk of the area is given over to a sparring ring set off by ropes attached to spears thrust into holes in the ground, and to a sanded wrestling area. A long weapons rack against the south wall holds six halberds, six two-handed swords, six huge clubs, six two-handed axes, a score of javelins, a pair of rudishva ballistic batons (see new technological items), six large crossbows, and 120 large crossbow bolts.

9 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 63, 61, 60, 59, 59, 58, 57, 55, 53; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special 
defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword.

18 lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60, 59(x3), 58(x3), 57(x3), 55(x3), 54(x3), 53, 51; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special 
defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

Igrippa the Unruly, a true varumani (see new monsters) (33% chance): SZ L; AL LN; AC 0; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-25 (mattock +1, 2-20+5). Special 
defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: mattock +1, ring mail +2. 

8 varumani infants (see new monsters), 2 of which are true: SZ M; AL LN; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 26, 25, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 17; #AT 3; Dmg 1-2/1-2/1-6. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.

Treasure:
Underneath the table is a trough-sized wooden box containing 5,743 sp; 16 dried mushrooms (8 white ribs, 2 red veils, 2 orange lamps, and 4 cloud caps – see new flora for all); a vial of stone salve; a mask of the skull (carved as a kaliyani skull/face); and several rudishva identity plaques: 2 copper, one rust, and one pink.

### 7-27: Thegn’s Audience Hall

This vast, 25’-tall hemispherical hall is one of the central ritual chambers for the varumani. The walls are natural stone, but painted bright blue. The curved east wall contains a 30”-tall frieze (starting 4’ from the ground) that the original varumani brought with them from Level 5. Composed of high-relief figural and geometric sculptures, the frieze tells the story of the rudishva hegemony’s conquest of the middle halls and its defeat of the heqeti. Tall, spindly, horned bipeds (rudishva), as well as thick, muscled bipeds (varumani) are common, while bird-men (varuda) and a few sinuous bipeds (kaliyani) are also visible. The final scenes depict varumani assaulting a ziggurat structure, around which scores of heqeti are dying. A bright red curtain hides the hallway to the west; on the curtain is embroidered a massive grinning varumani head.

The chamber is dominated by the chairs of thegns. These simple plasteel seats are affixed by iron bolts to a 5’-tall granite dais. The central chair alone shows signs of wear; the flanking chairs are, in fact, dusty.

Most of the time (93%) the Audience Hall is filled with 3-30 varumani youth, who noisily and good-naturedly practice wrestling and martial arts here. 

Special Ceremonies: On rare occasions, the hall is filled with varumani for a Moot or an Audience. In the case of the varumani Moot (which is underway 1% of the time when PCs first arrive), the thegn assembles all available varumani to discuss some pressing matter, usually one with clear implications to the entire people. Such matters might include a decision to go to war, to ally with a certain faction, to occupy a new section of halls, to devote resources to a particularly costly or dangerous task, etc. At a Moot the thegn stands on the dais and conducts an open discussion, in which any varumani is free to speak; about 65 true, 70 lesser, and 30 bestial varumani will be present. Outsiders, unless they are formal allies or have something pertinent to add to the discussion, are not permitted to attend.

An Audience is a more regular (6% chance when PCs first arrive) occurrence. At such meetings, the thegn meets with important allies to discuss, generally, their requests, and/or to offer a judgment in the case of a dispute. Either way, the thegn is accompanied by his housecarls (7-29), his court sorcerer (7-22), and 2-40 true, 2-40 lesser, and 1-20 bestial varumani. Outsiders (including PCs) are only admitted to an Audience if they are already well-known and admired by the varumani.

Treasure: 
A hidden compartment in the frieze holds some valuables. It is activated by locating and pressing a catch found in the heqeti ziggurat represented on the frieze. The release causes a section of the frieze to swing open, revealing a 2’x2’x1’ space within which are the following: a silver plastic rudishva identity plaque, a rudishva gas grenade, and a rudishva personal defense array with a full lesser power supply (see new technological items for all). The varumani are ignorant of the existence of this valuable hoard.

### 7-28: Cave of Grateful Respite

The varumani use this cave for meditation and contemplation. Several benches and stools have been carved into the rock, but otherwise it is rough and natural, with colorful lichens, flowstone, and not a few stalagmites and stalactites. 

All varumani save the thegn (7-30), the court sorcerer (7-22) and the first adept (7-24) believe the cave’s name, “Cave of Grateful Respite,” to be connected to its current meditative purpose. But those leaders know the truth, namely that it was the first place of respite found by the varumani who fled from Level 5 during the collapse of the rudishva hegemony. It is thus deeply connected to the origin story of the varumani. More significantly, the secret door on the west wall provides access to a set of caves hiding a secret route to Level 5 (see area 7-88). Varboka, Ashoka and Glif are the only who know of the secret door and the fact that it leads to somewhere near their ancient halls, but even they have been unable to proceed further than area 5-141. That is, they have not managed to discover the connections to the Midnight Road (5-135) or the resting place of Vanara (5-139), even if they suspect that area 5-141 ought to lead to someplace important.Secret Door (west): This door is difficult to locate (1 in 8) and is tall and narrow. The door opens to any who declaims “Open in the name of Vanara” in Varumani before it; otherwise, only force or magic will open it.

### 7-29: Thegn’s Housecarls

The thegn’s twelve housecarls reside in this chamber. It is fairly spartan, with twelve hammocks, a water barrel, a pair of communal chests, and some weapons racks. At any given time six of the housecarls are present with Varboka while the others kill time in this chamber. At important ritual or diplomatic moments, however, the full complement of twelve accompanies the thegn. If Varboka is in his private chamber (7-30), though, all twelve housecarls will be present here. The housecarls are all fully loyal to Varboka.

6 or 12 true varumani housecarls (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 0; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 61, 61, 60(x4), 59(x5); #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 8-26 (two-handed sword +2, 2-20+6). 
Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword +2; ring mail +2. If Varboka is in area 7-30, there are 12 housecarls here; otherwise there are 6.

Treasure:
The communal chests contain several varieties of dried meat; six packs of playing cards (2 gp each); eight sets of dice (10 sp each); a dozen silver drinking cups (15 gp each); six knives with elk-horn handles (5 gp each); a set of Archontean chessmen in ivory (25 gp each, or 650 gp for the set); a head of an Archontean nobleman carved out of ivory, and decorated with ebony and gold (375 gp); a pair of beautiful ivory drinking horns carved with Wiskin scenes (225 gp each); a large polar bear fleece (55 gp); and a cash reserve of 757 gp and 1,238 sp.

### 7-30: Varboka, the Troll Thegn

This chamber hosts the private quarters of Varboka the troll thegn. The walls are painted a pleasing sea green, over which has been added a fine (in varumani terms) portrait of Varboka. Several mottoes are also visible, all written in spidery Semi-glyphik: “the People cannot be stopped!”, “the only good dead hopper is a cooked hopper!”, “Smile if you love the thegn!” and so forth. 

Varboka’s bed is a simple wooden affair, loaded with silk sheets (125 gp) and rare furs (3 pelts, worth 375 gp total). His armor and weapon rack stands by the door, while a pot of stew bubbles over a tripod of heating (see new magic items) around which cluster four stools. He owns a fine, teak, inclined writing desk (450 gp, but difficult to move) that is pushed against the south wall, under his portrait. A keg of fine brandy completes the scene (225 gp).

Lying atop the writing desk is a draft of an ultimatum to the goblin king, Weskenim (SL4-22), demanding formal submission of the goblins and the installation of varumani ‘advisors’ on Sub-Level 4. This document would be extremely valuable to Weskenim (500 gp), and would win the alliance of the goblins for he/she who delivered it. Within the writing desk are the following: a pouch of silvered sand (100 gp); a set of fine writing inks and quills (35 gp); a primer written in Semi-glyphik and entitled ‘How to Write Elegantly’ (see Arden Vul books); a quire of ruled parchment with sample ‘letters’ in Semi-glyphik, and space to practice them; and Varboka’s Logbook (see Arden Vul books). The desk has a secret compartment of which Varboka is ignorant: if the correct catch is found and depressed, a small panel pops open, revealing an exceptionally crafted platinum orb on which had been delicately etched the shape of the continents from the varumani homeworld (8,000 gp).

Varboka knows there was something ‘wrong’ with the evidence that implicated Gog (5-2) in treason, and caused his banishment. Varboka will pay up to 2,500 gp if evidence of Gog’s innocence is found; that evidence is located in area 8-151, with Muq.

Varboka is also deeply alarmed at the sudden reappearance of kaliyani in Arden Vul (a band of hunters slew three kaliyani on the chasm floor two months ago). He has issued a bounty of 100 gp apiece for kaliyani fangs. Although nervous about this development, he also greets the prospect of a ‘good war’ against the kaliyani (one that all varumani would support) with growing interest, since a victory would cement his reputation as one of the 
great thegns. As yet, however, Varboka is ignorant of the location of the kaliyani; indeed, his people have not encountered any other kaliyani after that first battle.

When present in his chamber (see below for chances), he is likely to be found entertaining his two favorite companions, Heska and Breg.

Secret Door (east): The door is easy (1 in 4) to locate. Only the key held by Varboka will open it.

Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: a two-handed vorpal sword +4 that he calls ‘Peacemaker’; ring mail +3; a purse with 37 gp, 112 sp, and 7 octagonal platinum coins (see Arden Vul items); keys to 
7-11, 7-28, 7-31, 7-37, 7-39, and 7-67; an operator’s keycard for the controller of 7-11; and a pink rudishva identity plaque (see new technological items).

Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-level magic user, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: mattock; shield.

## Level 7: 31 - 45

### 7-31: Varumani Treasure Hall

All varumani know that this chamber exists, but only the thegn knows how to access it. The hall is 10’ tall, undecorated, and brightly lit by two rudishva light globes (see new technological items). Troll chests (see new technological items), stone tables, and steel racks are crammed into the room, scattered among which is a king’s ransom in treasure. 

The items in the north ell, including two troll chests, are the thegn’s personal hoard, while the items just inside the secret door from 7-30 are what is known as the ‘Mighty Strength of the People.’ The ‘Mighty Strength’ comprises ancient objects and weapons that the varumani bore with them in their flight from Level 5, as well as some famous trophies. Theoretically any varumani in the court can formally request that the thegn produce any or all of the ‘Mighty Strength’ to be viewed and/or used by the assembled clans. Should this request be supported by representatives from the other three clans, then the thegn is obligated to produce the goods. In practice, this sort of request is rare; indeed, the last formal request was made 250 years ago at the time of the Archontean expedition of Adrienic (see 5-18 et seq.). 

The Mighty Strength of the People: Scattered about the tables are 2 laser rifles, 6 laser pistols, a laser deflector shield, a sonic fence, 3 stun batons, two broken Nutri-Vore 2000 devices (for all of which, see new technological items), as well as embalmed corpses of a heqeti weaver, a kaliyani, and a human. Alas, no power supplies remain for any of these potent devices. Both troll chests are keyed to the hand of the thegn. The first troll chest contains 10 25-lb bars of platinum worth 6,250 gp each, plus a piece of ancient pink plasteel on which is written the following, in Semi-glyphik: “Let the People not forget their home, Bunda-Three, nor their glorious history as star walkers and faithful servants of the Lords Rudishva. Repair the Beacon so they may return whence they came!” [GM Note: this note, meant to remind the varumani of their origins and provide them with a racial goal, provides valuable clues about the extra-terrestrial nature of the rudishva and varumani, and about the Beacon’s identity as a starship]. The second troll chest contains rust, copper, brown, bronze, and sky blue rudishva identity plaques (see new technological items); an amulet of courage (see new magic items); an insidious bone flute (see new magic items); to which is attached a tag that reads in Semi-glyphik, ‘Do not blow into holes’; a disarticulated skeleton of a kaliyani formed of solid silver (3,500 gp); the gold and platinum archon’s baculus lost by Adrienic 230 years ago in 7-76 (5,000 gp); a silver and emerald cloak clasp with the name Adrienic on it (1,150 gp); 4 bolts of fine yellow silk embroidered with red flowers (150 gp each); a wood and copper scale model of a heqeti ziggurat (1,200 gp); and a rudishva grav disk lacking a power supply (see new technological items).

The Thegn’s Personal Treasure: In the northern ell lies Varboka’s personal hoard. In plain site are the following: a suit of imperial field plate +1 (see Arden Vul items); a halfling- or goblin-sized suit of leather armor +3; a tower shield +2; a sling +2 and a short bow +2 (both too small for varumani use); a porter’s carpet (see new magic items); a guardian caryatid (see new magic items) in the form of a cat-headed biped carrying a mace in each hand; a rod 
of resurrection, useless to the cleric-less varumani, with 6 charges remaining; and an ancient Archontean tapestry that depicts the use of the obelisks in the city of Arden Vul to open a door, which is marked ‘Beacon’ [GM Note: this is a hint about using areas AV-5, AV-41, and AV-28 to open the doors at AV-34 that lead to SL14-1]. In the first troll chest are 4,501 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items); 2,159 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items); 3,499 gp; and 12,641 sp. In the second troll chest are potions of extra healing (x2), invulnerability, longevity, treasure finding, and undead control; a pair of boots of striding and springing sized for a SZ S creature; a girdle of hill giant strength; a tooth of Pol (see new magic items); and the following note, inscribed in spidery Semi-glyphik on a piece of blue plasteel: “The hangar for the thegn’s flying sleds is located just north of the transit octagon. The thegn holds the key.” [GM Note: this refers to areas 7-35 to 7-37]. 

### 7-32: Great Pit of the Varumani

This vast hall plays an important daily and ritual part in the lives of the varumani. Five rows of stone benches circle the upper part of the chamber, leading down 15’ to a sunken, sanded area. This area – the actual ‘Pit’ - is located 5’ below the level of the lowest set of seats. The ceiling rises 20’ above the entrance level, and the entire area is lit by eight rudishva light globes suspended from the ceiling (see new technological items). 

Most of the time the hall is filled with the sound of ringing steel and loud, but friendly, taunts and challenges: the varumani ceaselessly practice their combat skills on the sands of the pit and even among the seats. At such times 7-12 true varumani may be found sparring with weapons, while 11-20 lesser varumani wrestle (50%) or spar (50%). 

Cleansing of Sorrows: At least once a month the thegn presides over this important ritual. At that ceremony all grudges between individual varumani or groups of 2-5 varumani are settled by duels. The parties to a duel agree to terms, and particularly to the desired outcome, in advance: outcomes range from first blood to lack of consciousness or even (rarely) to death. Almost all varumani who are not ‘on duty’ (at 7-1, 7-8, 7-38, etc.) attend the Cleansing of Sorrows, cheering, singing songs, and offering praise or sorrow to the parties. Although a Cleansing ceremony is scheduled when pre-existing grudges are known and registered with the thegn, it is not uncommon for varumani from the crowd to remember old, forgotten grudges, partly as a way to keep the festivities going. It is exceedingly rare for non-varumani to be allowed to witness, let alone participate in, a Cleansing. Only those who are already known and respected to the varumani leadership and who subsequently enter into a dispute with a varumani are permitted to duel in the Cleansing of Sorrows. At such a ceremony the thegn, his housecarls, the chiefs of all four clans, the sorcerers, and approximately 70 true, 150 lesser, and 50 or more bestial varumani will be present. When PCs first arrive at the thegn’s court there is a 2% chance that a Cleansing of Sorrows ritual is taking place. If a ceremony is not occurring, it will occur in d30 + d6 days.

The Victors’ Right: This ritual is less common than the Cleansing of Sorrows. It has a 1% chance of being underway when the PCs first arrive, and will occur in the future in d100+30 days (modified by -5 days per prisoner held in 7-33). In this ritual, prisoners from the Cells (7-33) are brought to the Great Pit and sacrificed by a hand-picked team of varumani. The prisoners are given no weapons, and spell casters are gagged to begin, but all are permitted to fight back as best they can. Usually the varumani make this into a ‘fun’ spectacle of humiliation and terror. When this ritual is taking place, the thegn will be present as well as 1-4 of the clan chiefs, 30 true varumani, 90 lesser varumani, and 60 bestial varumani.

### 7-33: The Cells

Treb the lesser varumani presides over the prisoners of the thegn in this location. The central area is brightly lit by two rudishva light globes (see new technological items), and contains an interrogation table with implements, plus a side table, a pair of chairs, and a stack of carefully preserved human-skin on which Treb practices his surprisingly adept painting techniques. 

Those captured in battle (a rarity) or those who fall afoul of the thegn within his domain are imprisoned here. Each cell is bare stone with a simple wooden bucket for necessities. At the moment the cells contain the following persons:

A. Berenice, a Set Deacon (see new monsters) whose tongue has been ripped out, as a 6th-level female Archontean cleric of Set: SZ M; AL LE; AC 10; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 15 (max 37); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. She has no possessions, and is unable to pray for spells. The varumani caught her attempting to infiltrate their private areas, and have scheduled her to be slain in the next ritual of the Victor’s Right (see 7-32).

B. Empty

C. A heqeti hopper (see new monsters), as 4th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 4; HP 7 (max 25); #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite). Special attacks: hop; +1 to damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and water/ice.

D. Kador Malachite and Kegil Malachite, dwarven brothers taken while searching for the forge of Zhorak (8-100). he brothers are bound, and Kegil is gagged; he has no spells prepared. The varumani see few dwarves, and are contemplating what to do about the pair. 

a. Kador, 5th-level dwarf fighter: SZ S; AL N; AC 9; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 19 (max 41); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 17, INT 10, WIS 12, DEX 15, CON 16, CHA 9. 

b. Kegil, 5th-level dwarf cleric: SZ S; AL LN; AC 10; MV 90’; HD 5; HP 21 (max 47); #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 12, INT 13, WIS 17, DEX 9, CON 16, CHA 15. 

E. Joskelin Artiklines, 8th-level male Archontean ranger: SZ M; AL CG; AC 10; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 30 (max 77); #AT 3/2; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 18/61, INT 13, WIS 14, DEX 10, CON 16, CHA 15. Spells: speak with animals. Joskelin is an agent of the imperial Drome (see World of Archontos appendix), sent by the exarch in Narsileon to gather information about the demise of the imperial expedition sent 250 years ago and to report on opportunities for renewed imperial expansion. Joskelin appeared at the Troll Market (7-76), posing as a merchant, but was identified by a visiting Set deacon and hence seized by the varumani. The thegn is still considering what to do about him.

Treb, a lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (mattock, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-

### 7-34: Waste Pit Crossroads (to 5-125 and 8-24)

* This natural cavern extends under 7-16 and is filled with centuries of refuse dumped by the varumani cooks.
	* To the north the cavern gives forth onto the Great Chasm (7-3).
		* 3 ropes with loops and knots extend across and steeply down the chasm, allowing dangerous access to the Nether Reaches (8-24).
			* The ropes were set up by the kaliyani now exploring 5-125. 
	* To the south, a narrow tunnel snakes upward through various cutbacks before debouching at 5-125.

* An otyugh has taken up residence among the tasty trash.  It is easily bribed by gifts of food to allow passage through the waste pit.
	* A too-generous gift, causes the otyugh to imprint on the giver and follow its new friend, sending him/her warm and hungry thoughts at a near constant rate.

1 otyugh: SZ M; AL N; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 8; HP 52; #AT 3; Dmg 1-8/1-8/2-5. Special attacks: disease. Special defenses: limited telepathy (30’); never surprised.

### 7-35: Hidden Rudishva Corridor

* This corridor (w/o 90-degree angles) provides access between the Great Pillar and chasm.
	* On the chasm side, a double-sized iris door is concealed by centuries of vines and creepers (opens to pale green, pink, orange, silver, or yellow identity plaque).
	* The interior rudishva iris door leading to the Great Pillar opens to a special key (-40% to pick, 12th-level, wizard lock).
		* The troll thegn (7-30) and the Arena Lord (6-85) each possess a key (1’-long, 3”-diameter, grey plasteel rods with a notched, 1”-tall flange on each end).
	* No one – not even the thegn – has visited this area in decades.

### 7-36: Thegn’s Hangar

* The iris door to the hangar opens only to a silver or yellow rudishva identity plaque.
* The chamber is sheathed in white marble tiles, shaped to fit the angle-less room.
	* Within are two rudishva hover sleds.
		* One sled is a bit wonky (5% chance per turn of activity to misfire).
	* The location of these sleds is a secret passed from thegn to thegn.  He visited them as a young man, but Varboka has never used the sleds.

### 7-37: Great Pillar

* From this location, the Great Pillar provides access upwards to 5-138 and 6-130 and downwards to the chasm floor at 9-30.
	* No bridge to the central shaft exists at this level.
	* Both rudishva iris doors leading to the pillar require a special key to unlock, not an identity plaque (-40% to pick, 12th-level wizard-locked).
		* The troll thegn (7-30) and the Arena Lord (6-85) each possess a key (1’-long, 3”-diameter, grey plasteel rods with a notched, 1” flange on each end).

* For a general description of the Great Pillar and how to navigate it, see 5-138.
	* The pod of chasm cephalopods (5-138) may be attracted (50% chance) to light and noise here.

### 7-38: Varumani Guard

* Three lesser varumani (Kit, Vor, and Cos) and a true varumani (Hendrav) keep a lazy watch here at the easternmost outpost of the varumani domain.
	* A pair of pet baindara (new) from 7-4 keep them amused with their antics.
	* They ensure anyone approaching from 7-39 or 7-40 carries proper authorization (accompanied by a known, respected varumani and/or carrying a troll thegn’s passport).
	* Hendrav is quite bored and would appreciate some clever repartee with visitors.
* The chamber contains four benches, a water barrel, and a tripod of heating (new).
	* The door to the south is locked and barred from this side; only the thegn has a key to it.

Hendrav, a true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed axe, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.

### 7-39: Decrepit Rudishva Hall

* One of the Priscian war mage triads (new) based in 7-44 is attempting to access the Great Pillar (7-37).
	* Lacking keys, they are stymied for the moment.
	* The thegn rarely visits the Great Pillar, so it is unlikely they will be discovered any time soon. If discovered, they immediately summon assistance from 7-44, but prefer to negotiate before fighting.

Scarred Crotus, Priscian war mage (see new monsters) and member of Secundus, as a 4th-level Thorcin magic user: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 15; #AT 1; Dmg 3-9 (Priscian gladius +2).

	* A clear path through the debris littering the floor leads south to 7-41 and 7-42.
	* The tunnel to the north leads downward to the 8-137.

### 7-41: Ancient Stone Chairs

* These chairs (10’ wide, 10’ tall, 5’ wide with seats 5’ high) are stone, with backs loosely covered by extremely worn of leather.
	* The seat and arms of the chairs are worn, as if by use. 
	* Incised on each chair are two large (2’-square) Rudishva glyphs, one on the seat and one on the back under the leather throw.
		* North seat: rune of Restoration (seat); rune of Guardianship (back). 
		* South seat: utterly destroyed rune (seat); rune for Guardianship (back).
		* The runes are activated by living flesh (touching, sitting on).  The leather is thick enough to prevent contact.

* Rune of Guardianship
	* If either of these runes is activated, a giant rudishva skeleton bursts forth from a hidden niche behind the appropriate chair.
* Rune of Restoration
	* This rune sends a plesant, tingling jolt of energy through the activator; dazed for 1d3 rounds but healed 3d4.  Target and their items is subject to a dispel magic (as 18th-level magic user).

2 semi-intelligent giant rudishva skeletons: SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68, 57; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%. Special attacks: bone

	* Debris from fallen stone sheathing, campsites, blood, and other unidentifiable biological material is scattered throughout the chamber.
	* Stairs to the north lead upwards for 200’ to 6-65.
* As the main route taken by the varumani to the Arena, 66% to have an encounter.

### 7-43: Empty Rudishva Chamber

* Both the tunnel to this empty chamber and the chamber itself have suffered significant damage over the years.
	* The iris door (sky blue or higher to open) still works and leads to 7-46.

### 7-44: Priscian Camp

The Priscians based on the floor of the chasm (9-58 to 9-64) discovered the tunnel at 7-64 (aka 9-41) and widened it, allowing them access to this small portion of Level 7. Eager to plumb the mysteries of the nearby Great Pillar (7-37), a war mage triad accompanied by three conversi has established a camp in this chamber. They are cautiously exploring the surrounding areas. 

The west wall of the hall fragment contains a niche in which stands a 4’ watcher nataraja (see new magic items). The watcher nataraja is inert since its original possessor died millennia ago. The activation word for the watcher is written on the sole of its left foot (the Rudishva word for ‘look’). Speaking the activation word (in Rudishva) allows one to control the watcher.

If threatened, the Priscians shout loudly in order to summon their colleagues from 7-39.

Secret Door (east): This door is difficult to locate (1 in 8). The key to this door is held by Jellicos. The lock may be also picked (+5% to chances) or the door may be beaten down.

Possessions: leather armor +1; dagger +3; short sword; sling; a pouch with 15 sardonyx gems (50 gp each) and 73 gp; and a potion of invisibility.

Paganus, Priscian conversus (see new monsters), as a 5th-level male Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL NE; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 5; HP 47; #AT 1; Dmg 5-12 (battle axe +1) or 1-4 (light crossbow).

##### 7-44a: Stairs Up to Sub-Level 4 (SL4-45)

* This narrow staircase leads up to a hidden area of the Goblin Warrens (SL4-45).
	* The stairs allowed the Priscians now encamped at 7-44 to establish an embassy to King Weskenim (see SL4-22).

### 7-45: Great Cavern, or the Varumani Proving Grounds

This massive cavern averages 75’ in height. Phosphorescent mush-rooms from the southern portion of the cavern (south of the pool at 7-49) offer a dim light, through which can be glimpsed several looming rock formations (7-47, 7-48, and 7-53). The environment is humid and damp, and the air is filled with the sound of drips and subterranean insects. Numerous ledges line the walls of the cavern, some of which lead to small subsidiary cave systems.

The varumani access the cavern via the wooden ladder at 7-63. While they have not formally colonized the cavern, the varumani consider it to lie within their domain. They maintain it as a sort of nature preserve, albeit with several practical functions as well: 

1) it is a place for young varumani to learn combat techniques against the monsters that typically congregate nearby; 
2) it provides valuable food supplies in the form of giant mushrooms and hunted animals; 
3) it is mined for valuable arcanum (see new magic items), iron, and ‘glowing sand’ (radioactive silicon); and 
4) it provides alternative routes to other portions of the lower Halls (especially 7-52, which provides access to the silver mine at 9-27). To the north, a deep, sandy pool of spring-fed water surrounds a 40’-tall rock formation (7-47 and 7-48).

To the south, the cavern is dominated by a small fungal forest, in which grow all the same species found in the Great Cavern of Level 3 (3-163, 3-172): white ribs, white bulbs, orange lamps, eye-openers, cloud caps, blue trumpets (see new flora for all). The mushrooms surround another prominent rock formation, on the top of which is an ancient ruin (7-53).

Chances for a random encounter are doubled here.

## Level 7: 46 - 60

### 7-46: Ledge with Snakeskin

* This ledge sits 40’ above the floor of the main cavern.
	* An enormous molted snake skin lies on the floor of the ledge.
	* An iris door (sky blue or better to open) leads east.
	* Secret Door (north wall): swings on pins set on either side of the frame, by pushing on the lowest portion of the door.  Unused by the varumani for centuries.

### 7-47: Rock Formation

* The top of this 20’-tall rock formation is relatively flat.
	* Young varumani occasionally perch on it, waiting for prey to pass beneath.

1-4 teenaged lesser varumani (see new monsters) (25% chance): SZ L; AL LE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 46, 42, 40, 37; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 2-5/2-5/2-8 or 2-16 (club). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

### 7-48: Varumani Sand Mining Operation

The varumani dredge the pool (7-49) for ‘glowing’ sand and other objects from atop this 25’ rock formation.

The formation is reached by a pair of small, 2-person dinghies, one of which is attached to the eastern shore (near 7-63) and the other to the western foot of 7-48.

Hand- and foot-holds in the formation allow the varumani to clamber to the top.

The varumani have learned to paddle swiftly to avoid the blood eels that infest 7-49.

Atop the formation are four dredging stations and an 8’ structure formed of well-fitted stone blocks.

Most of the time two varumani are found here, operating the dredges and filtering muck. 

Dredging Stations: These four areas are comprised of iron structures from which a heavy bucket depends. Using a winch, the varumani drop the bucket into the depths of the pond and pull up the contents of the bottom. The contents are sorted and filtered inside the neighboring structure.

Structure: This simple stone structure holds a sluice and rocker box for sifting the materials dredged from the pond, as well as a couple of barrels used to hold the gathered ‘glowing’ sand. A wooden box in the corner holds other strange objects dredged from the pond: a rudishva skull with horns, six small pieces of plasteel in various colors, 2 badly corroded and unusable rudishva lesser power supplies, a badly corroded long sword, a glass vial still filled with contact poison, and 4 deep blue spinels (500 gp each). 

Glowing Sand: The sand is fine and glows with a yellow-green color. It is, in fact, radioactive silicon from a nuclear disaster that occurred here in the early years of the rudishva hegemony (see below). As the varumani are immune to the radiation, they are happy to use it for smithing purposes in the Triple Forge (7-68). Given its off-world properties, it is potentially quite valuable, and might fetch 50 gp/lb from alchemists. Non-varumani who stay into contact with the glowing sand for more than 3 days, however, suffer from radiation sickness: 1-4 HP damage plus a loss of one point of CON for each subsequent day of contact. HP lost from radiation sickness may be regained normally, but CON loss can only be cured magically.

GM Note: The nuclear-powered fuel-injection pod of the Beacon ended up in this cavern when the starship crashed. Although the udishva discovered the pod and tried to repair it, it eventually suffered a nuclear meltdown, turning areas 7-48 and 7-49 into a dangerous, radioactive slag pool. 

2 lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58, 53; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

### 7-49: Mysterious Pool

* This small lake surrounds the varumani sand mining operation at 7-48.
	* The water is not radioactive and doesn't glow, but the silicates mixed into the natural muck at the bottom gives off a visible yellow-green glow (see 7-48).
	* Beneath a layer of muck and radioactive sand on the bottom is some ruined-era plasteel, slagged machinery, and other detritus. 
		* For each 1-4 turns spent swimming and searching, roll an item (each is found once, subsequent rolls of that number find 1d3 bones).

* The pool also contains a pack of 24 vicious, mutated eels the varumani call ‘blood eels’.
	* Swimming in the pond, peering into it for any length, or boating attracts 3-6 eels.
	* The eels are ravenous and attack without fear.
	* Extended combat brings another group within 3-6 rounds.

D8 Result
* 1-3) Nothing
* 4) A rust rudishva identity plaque
* 5) A miraculously undamaged rudishva lesser power supply
* 6) 47 ancient silver pennies and 59 ancient gold solidi
* 7) 1’-tall oblong black stone inscribed with the word ‘Sortian’ (an activation stone for 7-53 or 7-62)
* 8) A human tibia, with the phrase “Thoth does consume magic” carved into it. This cryptic phrase may help in solving the puzzle in the tomb of Muirasso (see 5-37).

24 blood eels (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’ swimming; HD 3; HP 20(x8), 18(x8), 15(x8); #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: drain blood; 5% chance for disease.

### 7-50: Ledge

* This ledge sits 35’ above the cavern floor, providing a view of the varumani mining operation (7-48).
	* Corpses of two adventurers rest here, in badly damaged splint and chain armor.
		* All valuables have been stripped from the bodies.

### 7-51: Varumani Iron Mine

* Metal rings on rock echo from the entrance to these looping caves and tunnels.
	* Here the varumani mine high-quality iron they use in their triple forge (7-68).
* The tunnels average 8.5’ in height, while the wider openings (caves) are 10’-15’ tall.
	* The mine is dark unless otherwise noted.
	* At the entrance are 4 large buckets (2 hold 75 lbs iron ore) and 2 shoulder yokes.

##### 7-51a: Cave-Im

* A cave-in occurred in this spur, killing an incautious human adventurer.
	* The tips of her booted feet may be glimpsed from beneath a huge pile of rock.
	* If digging her out, 4-in-6 chance of a further cave-in causing 6d6.
		* 55 sp, 153 gp; a suit of chain mail; a mace +2; a clerical scroll (cure serious wounds, regeneration), a map showing the floor of the Great Chasm (area 9-1) with key features and the route to 7-52 (via 9-1, 9-19, 9-21, 9-23, and 9-27) clearly marked.

##### 7-51b: Danger Sign

* This connecting tunnel shows little sign of actual mining.
	* A broken pick is jammed into the rock at the point marked by 51B.
	* Attached is a piece of plasteel with an image of a horned skull painted on it (a varumani sign for ‘danger’).

##### 7-51c: Iron Vein

* This cavern is brightly lit by a single rudishva light globe (tech) and holds a particularly rich vein of iron.
	* 4 lesser varumani miners are at work here with picks and mauls.  While not interested in chatting, they are not necessarily hostile.

##### 7-51d: Mine Scaffold

* A major iron vein exists in this brightly lit cavern.
	* Six lesser varumani miners are busy collecting ore from a wooden scaffold erected against the east and south walls.
		* These miners have little to offer, but will defend themselves if attacked.
			* They managed to defeat an over-bold band of adventurers arriving from 7-52, looted the corpses, and then threw them in the water at 7-51E.
				* 235 sp, 412 gp; a silver and ruby statuette of Set (625 gp); a long sword +1; six arrows +2; a set of jade armbands (450 gp); a scroll of fireball, protection from normal missiles, and hold person; and 2 potions of extra healing.

##### 7-51e: Tunnel Sump

* At this point the descending tunnel hits the waterline and becomes flooded.
	* The remaining 50’ of the tunnel are completely submerged.
	* It ultimately leads to a 6’-diameter opening in the bottom of 7-49.
	* The varumani tossed the corpses of 3 human and 1 elven adventurer into the water here for the blood eels (see 7-49 for stat) to devour, after looting them (see 7-51D)

##### 7-51f: Aggressive Xorn

 * 2 xorn just arrived here, swimming through the nearby rock, munching on delicate ores.
	 * They are hungry and attack anyone on whom they smell gold, silver, or gems.
	 * They have not yet encountered the miners in 7-51C or 7-51D.


4 lesser varumani (see new monsters), miners at 7-51C: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 59, 58, 57, 53; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% 
resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.
* Each has a pouch (11-30 sp) and a copper rudishva identity plaque

 6 lesser varumani (see new monsters), miners at 7-51D: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 61, 59, 58, 57, 53, 51; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.
* Each has a pouch (11-30 sp) and a copper rudishva identity plaque
 
2 xorn: SZ M; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 7+7; HP 55, 49; #AT 4; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-3/6-24. Special attacks: surprise on 1-5. Special defenses: immune to fire and cold; half damage from electricity; travel through stone.

### 7-52: Tunnel Down to 9-27

* Digging the mine, the varumani intersected another passage leading downward to the chasm floor (9-27).
	* The tunnel is narrow and cramped.

### 7-53: Ancient Sortian Teleportation Device

High above the ground and within this massive rock pillar lies the companion mosaic and teleportation device to that found in in 7-62. This chamber is almost completely hidden from the outside, with only a 2’-square window giving forth to the cavern; the window is found 40’ up the side of the pillar. 

The chamber is rough-hewn from the solid rock and is littered with the desiccated husks of numerous small animal forms, for eight huge spiders have established their nest here. Beneath the grime, however, is a beautiful mosaic some 20’ square. The centerpiece of the mosaic is a large, 10’-diameter image of a male human head, with close-cropped hair and beard, and Archontean nose, and kind eyes. His mouth is open wide. Four 1’-diameter holes are set in a diamond pattern around the face. If proper activation stones are placed in the holes, the mosaic can function as a teleportation device: if one stands on the image of the face and utters the word ‘Sortian’, one is instantly transported to 7-62. Currently, three of the activation stones are found in 7-62, while the fourth is in the murky water of 7-49.

Two levers sit in the floor near the locked southeastern door. One lever opens the door to the stone bridge leading to 7-54, while the second opens the steel door to 7-54 itself.

It is possible to scale the pillar, locate the window, and – if one is sufficiently small – slip inside. Still, the intended method of accessing this chamber is the teleportation device. Those arriving from 7-62 by teleportation will be confronted immediately by the huge spiders.

GM Note: The modern Priscian cult based on Level 9 has no idea that this area exists; bringing a map of its location to 9-58 might bring a reward of 5,000 gp and the good will of the Priscians.

8 huge spiders: SZ M; AC 6; MV 180’; HD 2+2; HP 18, 17, 16, 16, 16, 15, 14, 13; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: surprise 1-5; poison (+1 to saves); can leap up to 30’.

### 7-54: Ancient Idol

This cave is difficult to access, as it is located 30’ above the cavern floor and behind a locked, steel door. The door can be opened via the lever in area 7-53. Inside is an ancient idol to a long-forgotten worm deity. It was discovered in antiquity by Sortian explorers, who, alerted to its dangers, constructed the teleport device (7-62 and 7-53) and the doors as safety mechanisms. 

The idol sits on an elevated granite pediment (2’ tall), preceded by four red-granite, free-standing pillars. It is about 8’ tall and ess-shaped, taking the form of a curved, erect worm with a human-esque face looming over the pediment. The face has two enormous, platter-sized crystal eyes, a protruding proboscis-style nose, and an open mouth with razor sharp teeth. The worm body of the idol is formed from an enormous piece of ivory, from an unknown type of beast, while the face is etched and incised gold, with faceted crystal eyes and sharpened steel teeth.

Anyone standing on the pediment in front of the idol will see its eyes glow with a yellow light. That person has 1 round to hold an offering above its head before the worm strikes. If an appropriate offering is present (see below), the worm-idol lurches down and takes the offering in its mouth. If no offering is present, it strikes the blasphemer, rolling to hit as a 16 HD creature; if it hits, its teeth inflict 6-36 damage and have a chance of amputating an extremity (amputation occurs on any roll to hit of 18-20). If an offering is presented and accepted, the idol will drop a pair of 300 gp black pearls from its proboscis. Appropriate offerings include any precious metals worth at least 300 gp or any magic item. The idol is protected by powerful divine magic: it has a 100% magic resistance, and is AC -6 with 100 HP. Should PCs begin hammering at the idol, the ancient worm deity will gate in four horned devils to smite the desecrators.

GM Note: The ancient Sortians were puzzled by the existence of this idol, whose deity they did not recognize. The deity has no real connection to the other entities of Arden Vul and provides an opportunity for further GM development.

4 horned devils: SZ L; AL LE; AC -5; MV 90’, 180’ flying (Class D); HD 5+5; HP 41, 39, 37, 32; #AT 4, or 1+ weapon; Dmg 1-4/1/-4/2-5/1-3, or 1-3 and 2-12 (fork); MR 50%. Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: bleeding from tail strike (1 HP/rd); cause fear 5’ radius; pyrotechnics (1/rd); produce flame (1/rd); wall of fire of triple strength (1/day); charm person, suggestion. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from cold and gas; immune to fire. Special: ESP, detect magic, illusion; teleportation; know alignment; animate dead; summon horned devil (50%).

Treasure: 
Large black pearls (300 gp each).

### 7-55: Arcanum Cave

* The lip of this cave is 10’ above the floor of the main cavern, but relatively wide and hence easily noticed.
	* From the entrance a soft orange glow may be glimpsed.
* Within lies a massive pocket of raw arcanum (new), occasionally mined by varumani.
	* The arcanum is most visible as the knob-like projection extruding from the southeast wall.
	* Several picks, chisels, and other implements are strewn about the floor.
	* In addition to the usual properties of an arcanum chamber, it is possible to chip off pieces of arcanum in ½-lb or 1-lb chunks.

### 7-56: Sunken Cave of the Spectre 

* This sunken cave lies 30’ below both of the passages that connect to it.
	* A miasma of mist hangs in the air above the cave.
	* The ancient corpse of Heliabolus, a half-hearted member of the Sortian league, lies on the floor of the cave, where it was cast away in antiquity by his companions.
		* Heliabolus’s corpse: a robe of blending, a Sortian baculus (new) imbued with blink (15 charges); gauntlets of dexterity, a sapphire Sortian eye (new); a purse (73 ancient silver pennies); a piece of parchment detailing the discovery of the ancient idol at 7-54 and the creation of the transport circles used to access it.
* Heliabolus’s spirit has risen as a spectre, one that is, however, bound to the general area so long as his corpse remains unburied.
	* With the spectre are 4 half-strength varumani spectres created when unsuspecting varumani encountered the spectre.

Heliabolus the spectre: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 7+3; HP 52; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

4 half-strength spectres: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 3+3; HP 27, 26, 24, 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better 
weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### 7-57: Broad Shelf

* A wide, deep shelf, 30’ above the cavern floor overlooks the fungal forest.
	* It is covered fungi (aqua vitae, mind eater, and red veil forms (flora)).
	* Those who don't notice the existence of the upper shelf (7-58) are likely to be surprised by the phase spider that dwells there.

### 7-58: Upper Shelf with Phase Spider

* A second ledge exists 20’ above the first (50’ above the cavern floor).
	* A phase spider has its web in the cavern at the rear of the shelf.  It likes nothing more than to leap upon unsuspecting victims who climb to area 7-57.
		* In the muck beneath the spider’s web: a tarnished, finely-wrought silver box depicting scenes of Priscus Pulcher, Isadora, and other Sortians (75 gp, or 150 gp to a Priscian). Within are 20 ancient octagonal platinum coins, a scarab of enraging enemies, and a ring of mind shielding.

1 phase spider (95%): SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’, 150’ in web; HD 5+5; HP 43; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: poison (-2 to saves). Special defenses: phasing. 

### 7-59: Tunnel to SL13-33

* This tunnel snakes downward 150’ before debouching at SL13-33.

### 7-60: Empty Cave

* A broad ledge 20’ above the floor of the main cavern leads to an uninhabited cave.
	* It is a good place for resting; no random encounters here.
	* 5% per day, that the phase spider or 1-2 skinks wander by.

1 phase spider (5%) – see stats at 7-58.

1-2 cave skinks (see new monsters) (5%) – see stats at 7-61.

## Level 7: 61 - 76

### 7-61: Cave Skinks

* The cave slopes upwards sharply as it moves to the north, before ending in a sandy floor next to a pool of fresh water.
	* A large pod of 20 cave skinks (new) nests here, 10 present at any given time. 
		* Remove skinks killed as wandering monsters.
		* The varumani could easily wipe out this pod, but see no real reason to do so.

10 cave skinks (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 13 12(x3), 11, 11, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: toxic mucus.

### 7-62: Cave of the Spriggans

This dangerous location is accessed via a narrow ledge 30’ above the floor of the main cavern. The sound of chattering and singing is audible from the ledge, and the flicker of flames is visible from the same location. A set of crude steps lead down to a large cave lit by a campfire, around which crouch four small humanoids. The beings appear to be toasting bits of meat speared on sticks. A large boulder lies at the rear of the cave. The cave smells of sour wine and sweat, and a layer of dirt covers everything. 

The creatures are Arden Vul spriggans (see new monsters), who were tricked in antiquity into agreeing to guard the transportation circle that lies underneath the dirt. The spriggans are most unhappy with their millennium-long task, and are eager for conversation and the opportunity to trick someone else into guarding the location. They offer visitors a seat at the fire, a share of their toasted lizard meat, and the opportunity to chat. They freely admit to being stuck here, but will slyly attempt to get the PCs to agree to helping them out. If the PCs are suspicious or hostile, the spriggans begin to sing a famous (to them) song, ‘The Green Silken Robe’, as a round. After a few verses the round begins to degenerate and, one round later, it turns into the spriggans’ confusion attack. At that point they spriggans transform into giant size and attack. The ‘boulder’ is a pile of rotting varumani corpses hidden by phantasmal force. 

The Green Silken Robe

Verse 1:

As I was out strollin’ near Ripperham vill,
I spied a young lass with gold in her hair,
She smiled long and lovely and her eyes said ‘I will’,
And I stopped in my tracks at this image so fair.
I whistled and turned, and stared good and long, 
but twas’ her green silken robe that set me to song.

Chorus:

Oh, that Green Silken Robe,
Twas’ as fine as could be,
That emerald hue
Nearly blinded poor me.
Oh that green silken robe,
So tight and so trim,
As soon as I glimpsed it,
My heart went a-swim.

Many other verses exist, some quite explicit. The spriggans can sing this song for hours, improvising new, naughtier bits all the while.

Underneath the dirt and grime is a beautiful bit of mosaic about 14’ square. The center of the mosaic features an 8’-diameter depiction of a male human face with close cropped hair and beard. Those familiar with Sortian faces (see new magic items) will instantly recognize the image, for is it identical (complete with empty eye sockets). At the four corners of the mosaic are 1’ round holes in the pavement. 

The mosaic functions as a teleportation device that transports those who figure out its puzzle to area 7-53. The teleportation works as follows: 1) one places the four activation stones in the four holes in the mosaic; 2) one stands on the mosaic face; 3) one declaims the word “Sortian”. The spriggans have three of the activation stones, but they cast the fourth into the pond at 7-49 in a fit of rage. The stones are 1’-tall, oblong pieces of black granite on 
which has been carved (and filled with silver) the word ‘Sortian’.

GM Note: As with area 7-53, the modern cult of Priscus Pulcher (see areas 9-58 to 9-64) has no idea that this area even exists; it would pay much in wealth and favors to receive an accurate map of how to access this area.

4 Arden Vul spriggans (see new monsters): SZ S or L; AL CN; AC 4 (5); MV 90’ (150’); HD 5 (8+3); HP 37 (62), 35 (61), 34 (61) 32 (58); #AT 1 (2); Dmg 2-5 (knife) or (2-12/2-12); MR 
25%. Thief skills: PP 75%, OL 78%, FRT 70%, MS 77%, HS 64%, HN 35%, CW 81%, RL 40%. Special attacks: confusion 1/day. Special defenses: immune to poison, charm, and mind-affecting spells; healed by magic missiles. Special: grow to giant size; affect normal fires, faerie fire, trip, detect magic, shatter.

Treasure:
In addition to the three activation stones, the spriggans have accumulated a bit of treasure: 211 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) and 390 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul 
items); a gold flute inscribed with pictures of naked dancing girls (250 gp); a water pipe of ivory, copper, and enamel (75 gp); a silk chasuble with Sortian knots (90 gp); and a Sortian baculus (see new magic items) imbued with blink (11 charges remaining), and two potions of water breathing.

### 7-63: Ledge leading to the Varumani Domain

* A deep ledge 20’ off the ground provides access to the domain of the varumani.
	* A 25’ wooden ladder usually provides access up and down the cliff. 
		* 25% chance it has been pulled up and rests on floor of the ledge.

### 7-64: Tunnel to the Chasm Floor (9-41)

* This tunnel leads downward to a ruined heqeti area just off of the floor of the Great Chasm (9-41).
	* The Priscian explorers at 7-44 discovered this passage, allowing them to establish a camp (7-44) and establish an embassy with the goblin King Weskenim (SL4-22) via the stairs at 7-44a.
	* A smiley face is painted on the tunnel wall 50’ below where it departs 7-44.
		* It is the trigger for Frigg’s flatulence (new) cast by the Priscians as a warning.
			* If triggered by motion, the Priscians in 7-44 will be ready.

### 7-65: Varumani Guard Post

* The steel door (locked) on the east wall has a sliding view slit.
	* Four varumani stand guard here at all times, with orders to let only varumani enter.
	* They possess a couple of benches, a table, a bag of dice, and a large collection of shiny beetle shells with which they gamble endlessly.

1 true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 58; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4).

Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

### 7-66: The Record Keeper

* The aged varumani record keeper, Vimela, sits on a bench against the north wall.
	* He is available for consultation to any member of any of the clans.
	* Recently, demand for his services has declined, so he welcomes opportunity to speak with any interesting – but authorized – visitors.

Vimela, the true varumani record keeper: SZ L; AL LN; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 38; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-8. Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighter or 8th-
level magic user, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.
* Due to his advanced age, Vimela’s combat skills are greatly reduced.
* Possessions
	* He wears the key to Hall of Records (7-67) on a secure chain around his neck.
	* A fine jasper and silver ring (225 gp)

### 7-67: Varumani Hall of Records

This narrow hall contains the records of the varumani people dating back to the era of the rudishva hegemony. The east wall is lined with shelving, some of it plasteel and subtly ‘different’ (rounded edges, shallow shelves) and some of it wooden. The shelves contain a veritable treasure trove of information in two basic forms: 1) a set of 25 data crystals (see new technological items) in grey plasteel tubes, and 2) over 100 parchment codices. 

Among the data crystals are a handful of pre-collapse recordings (see below) as well as the digitized logbooks of the first seven thegns. Although the information on these crystals is 
exceptionally useful and valuable, the varumani currently possess no means of viewing them. In fact, the crystals have not been viewed in over a millennium.

The codices are quarto volumes, bound in grey lizard skin, and contain the thegn’s logbooks of every thegn from the 8th to the 37th (i.e., Varboka). The logbooks annalistically record the deeds and events of the varumani, both good and bad. So, the earliest parchment codex (the sole logbook of the 8th thegn) records the submission of the varumani to the archon, Marius Tricotor, called ‘invictus’ (see 6-154); the third logbook of the 16th thegn records the retreat of the Archonteans; the fourth logbook of the 31st thegn records the glorious varumani victory over Adrienic at the Cave of Blood (7-76); and so forth. The number of logbooks produced by a given Thegn varies by the length of that thegn’s reign and by 
personal proclivity; it is evident to any serious scholar, for instance, that the logbooks have become terser and less polished in the past century or so (indeed, Varboka is only beginning his second logbook despite having been Thegn for 53 years).

Against the north wall rests a stone table with two pieces of rudishva technology: a broken GnuCoder 3000 data recorder and a still functioning security encoder (see new technological items for both).

Vimela the Record-Keeper (7-66) is well-versed in the material found in the logbooks. He is able to suggest events of potential interest to browsers as well as swiftly to locate the books relevant to an already known event.

GM Note: It is impossible to detail all the historical information and potential adventure seeds found in this trove. The following, though, is a list of some of the more interesting non-logbook data crystals (see new technological items) preserved here: the People Improve, High Score!, the Thegns Speak, Service Manual for Optical Devices produced by GnuCoder S.A., Testimony of Vanara, Great Feats, the Faithful Manager, How to Talk with the Natives, Military Instructional Manual, and Voyages of the Shining Beacon of Glorious Heaven (see Arden Vul books for all).

### 7-68: Triple Forge of the Varumani

This massive, 30’-tall, vaulted hall is home to the famous triple forge, at which the varumani create high-quality steel, iron, and other practical objects for use and trade. The chamber is lit by a series of four pendent rudishva light globes (see new technological items) and is quite hot from the forge fire.

Forge: The forge proper is massive, being about 20’ long and 10’ wide, and built of the hardest granite. The base rises 3’ from the ground and has a steel door at the north end; the main fire is stoked by a lesser fire elemental bound to the forge by one of the past court sorcerers. Atop the base is a steel grill on which are set a number of lava rocks that conduct the heat from the elemental. Above the main base are two subsidiary grills, set 18” apart (so 
that the top grill is 3’ from the floor). These, too, have lava rocks on them; they are used for work that requires less heat. The forge pumps out dry heat at an impressive rate.

Smithing Stations: Three smithing stations circle the forge. Each station has a water trough, a metal-topped work table, and a massive anvil. A wide array of smith’s tools (tongs, hammers, 
crucibles, buckets, picks, etc.) rest on or beneath each table.

The northeast and northwest walls hold racks for finished weapons, armor, and utilitarian objects. At any given time one can find 7-12 two-handed weapons, 7-12 suits of ring mail, 7-12 helmets (for large creatures), and a variety of metal clips, nails, tools, etc.

The southwest wall holds an armorer’s station, where the master armorer improves and personalizes varumani ring mail. The southeast wall holds a jeweler’s station, with several benches and tables, under which are bins containing bits of copper, silver, gold and small ornamental and semi-precious stones. Molds and dies for ingots, wire, troll thegn’s passports, and other jewelry-like objects are also found here. Fine tools are scattered about the benches. A wall-mounted rack here also contains objects of the glass-blower’s trade.

The smiths receive regular shipments of smelted silver from the mining operations on Level 9 (see areas 9-22 to 9-28). One of their primary tasks is to turn that raw silver into ingots and wire.

Most of the time at least one of the four smiths is hard at work. If intruders from the east prove dangerous, one of the apprentices will be sent north to fetch help from the clan halls. Roll d10 to determine activity in the forge:

D10 Activity
1 Forge is empty; smiths are in 7-69 (75%) or elsewhere (25%)
2-3 1 smith at work
4-6 2 smiths at work
7-8 3 smiths at work
9 4 smiths at work, with important visitors (GM’s choice) looking on
10 All apprentices are present, cleaning the forge area

1. 1-4 smiths (80% - see above) – for stats, see 7-69.
2. 4 apprentices (10%) – for stats, see 7-69.
3. Visitors (10%)

Treasure:
Finished weapons, armor, and objects. Smithing tools (350 gp all told). Scrap precious metal worth 125 gp; a score of ornamental stones worth 200 gp total (5 eye agates, 5 azurites, 5 pieces of turquoise, and 5 pieces of obsidian); 8 semi-precious stones worth 340 gp total (2 bloodstones, 2 onyx, a peridot, an iolite, and 2 rock crystals).

### 7-69: Smiths’ Dwelling

The four varumani smiths and their four apprentices dwell in this warm side chamber. The smiths have decorated the walls by painting them white and then sketching exotic weaponry over the paint; although the weapons look fearsome, they are impractical and largely constitute a joke. Each smith has one corner of the chamber to himself, while the apprentices sleep on the floor in the central, common area. Each smith has a wooden cot, a small wooden chest, and a rack for personal items (weapons and armor). 

The common area contains a beautiful, 20’x10’ carpet depicting Marius atop the ‘sky sled,’ clad in his Archon’s regalia (GM Note: for Marius, see 6-145 and 6-154; the ‘sky sled’ refers to rudishva hover sleds – see new technological items); the carpet could be sold to Archontean elites for up to 750 gp. In addition, the common area has a tripod of heating (see new magic items), a barrel of ale, two benches, and two batter chairs.

Two of the smiths are true varumani (Shilva and Hinna) and two are lesser varumani (Loff and Migi). The apprentices are all lesser varumani. For locations of the smiths and apprentices, see chart at area 7-68. Although all the smiths and apprentices have fine ring-mail and weapons, they don’t typically wear or carry their equipment when at work or lounging in their quarters.

Treasure:
Each smith wears a heavy belt on which hang keys to 7-69 and 7-70 as well as his/her favored hammer. In addition, the smiths possess the following: 528 sp; 123 gp; a two-handed axe +2; a two-handed sword +2; a massive spear +2; a war hammer +2; four sets of varumani ring mail; and four pieces of impressive jewelry that constitute each smith’s master-piece, namely a gold and deep-green spinel goblet (3,000 gp), a ceremonial knife made of platinum and silver (1,750 gp) inscribed with the smith’s name (Hinna), a silver and emerald arm-ring (2,750 gp), and a silver and pearl pendant (975 gp). The apprentices have no wealth.



Shilva and Hinna, true varumani smiths (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (hammer, 2-20+4).

### 7-71: Tanning Vats

* A heavy leather curtain covers the entrance, mitigating the terrible odor from within.

	* Four stone basins in the center of the chamber, containing water and a series of chemical baths used to prepare the hides.
	* Stretching and drying racks are hammered into the walls.
* The smiths think tanning is beneath them, and don’t use this chamber very often, preferring to repurpose existing bits of leather.

### 7-72: Upper Hall of the Thegns

* Like its counterpart (7-12), this grand hallway is 20’ tall, broad, and brightly lit via continual light cast on the ceiling.
	* 3 niches hold 10' marble statues of the first three, and greatest, thegns: Druva (north wall), Rudiga (south wall), and Vanara (west wall).
		* They carved in an enthusiastic if somewhat clumsy style.
		* The varumani love and revere the statutes; dressing them with bright, loose clothing and painting their eyes, noses, and ears.
		* Varumani hoping for luck in an endeavor drop small tokens at the feet of Vanara (bits of hair or bone, fragments of plasteel, and objects of special meaning to the donor).

* Members of the court spill over into the western portion of the Hall of Thegns.
	* Roll once on Table 1 at 7-75 to determine who is present here, along with 5 varumani courtiers.

	* Each wall features a brightly-painted fresco depicting a different historical episode:
		* North: Vanara leads the people through a cavern
		* East: The thegn Girvala beheads Adrienic (dressed in imperial field plate) while varumani celebrate
		* South: Priyala stands over kneeling Archonteans (a reminder of the moment when the varumani regained independence)
		* West: A blood-streaked varumani in tedch-armor skewers a salamander-like thing (a heqeti) with a spear
	* Secret Door (south): narrow (2’), easy to locate (1 in 4), can be pushed open with STR 14+.  Leads to a secret tunnel to 7-8, allowing the thegn to come and go at court without passing through 7-1 or 7-72.

* GM Note
	* This is where private audiences with the thegn take place, provided that PCs are able to justify the need for such a private meeting.

### 7-75: Court of the Troll Thegn

This spectacular hall is the location of the thegn’s notorious court. Its 25’-tall ceiling is barrel vaulted, and supported by two rows of 3’-diameter granite columns. Over a dozen rudishva light globes (see new technological items) hang from the ceiling, and noise from the scores of courtiers and visitors is substantial.

The east and west walls feature enormous frescoes, showing famous varumani of the past several centuries; the frescoes serve as a sort of ‘court of honor’ for those non-thegns who have performed some deed of special value to the people. There are 23 such images, the majority of which (15) are ring-mail clad true varumani. Still, seven lesser varumani and even one bestial varumani are also depicted. Each image is carefully identified by name in spidery 
Varumani Semi-glyphik; among the names are Nolgi and Livod (both hunters, see 7-14), as well as Gog (see 5-2).

The court of the thegn is a center for political and diplomatic negotiations and, of course, plotting. At any given moment, the following are present:

A. 18-24 Varumani Courtiers
Courtiers are those varumani who have earned significant status in the eyes of their peers; that status may have come from combat, especially on the chasm floor (9-1), or from performing some impressive deed. Of the courtiers, 66% are true varumani and the rest are lesser varumani. The tables below allow the GM to determine both the reason for a courtier’s prominence and some of his/her current ideas or plans.

B. Sir Prudence, the Sun-Scarred Knight
Sir Prudence is a male Archontean of about 45 years in age. He has silver-grey hair, dark-black eyebrows, and a well-trimmed (grey) van dyke beard. He is accompanied at all times by his varlet, Beuvon. Sir Prudence arrived at the court of the troll thegn seven years ago and never left. Initially tasked to watch and report on the activities of the varumani, he has recently received orders to undermine Varboka’s authority, and in particular to prevent Varboka from moving against the goblins. Prudence has interests in varumani mating rituals (which he has still never witnessed), in the reasons why no varumani have ever been tapped as a Knight, and in the particular tactile qualities of the skins of all manner of creatures. He is also a reliable recruiter for the knights, and has been known to use his considerable persuasive abilities to convince members of NPC adventuring groups to consider a areer/lifetime as a knight. Finally, Prudence has a well-known soft spot for cheerful grifters and cheats, so long as he is not the victim. After a year in which the pair slept in a corner of the court, Varboka grudgingly allowed them to maintain a ‘permanent’ residence in one of the caves of the Troll Market (7-76A).

C. Ogre Guards
Two obedient ogre guards are stationed at each of the western exits to the court.

D. Visitors, in 4-8 distinct groups
Use the tables below to determine the size of such groups, as well as the motives of each group.

19 Fascinated with Archonteans and sorcery (at which the varumani have almost no skill). Eager to make alliances and connections with lawful Archonteans
20 Obsessed with a particular monster somewhere in the halls; wants it eliminated. GM’s choice.

Four sample courtiers, four groups of ordinary visitors, and two groups of special visitors are listed for the convenience of the GM:

Reja (courtier): A lesser varumani friend of Varboka’s from infancy, Reja has a status that exceeds his achievements. In fact, he has never really left the varumani domain and as such is openly ridiculed as a ‘poor specimen of a varumani’ by the more aggressive and the more martial. As a result, Reja is usually found leaning against a pillar, observing the goings-on rather than actively participating in them. Despite his ‘outsider’ status, though, Varboka plainly values Reja’s advice and wisdom. Indeed, Reja is one of the only varumani (perhaps the only one) to have noticed signs of a new faction within the halls: the Priscians. He has spotted and catalogued their devices (knots, images of bearded men), and knows that some of the magic users who pass through the court have been Priscians. To date, though, Reja keeps this information to himself. Those who befriend Reja might find the path to Varboka easier to tread.

Reja, a lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 57; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: mace.

Lishna (courtier): An aged (200+ years) true varumani who has been one of the prime strategic planners for the past several thegns, Lishna is very wise and sharp, and has a good mind for factional politics. It is for her mind that the thegns are willing to tolerate her frank and open xenophobia. Lishna distrusts all outsiders, and especially hates Archonteans. While she is too wily (and old) to confront outsiders directly, she actively attempts to undermine 
their diplomatic efforts at court. She is treated with respect but a certain amount of distance by the rest of the court. Lishna is aware of the lover’s aid orchid (see new flora and area 6-4), and will occasionally use specimens she has collected in order to further her purposes at court. 

Lishna, a true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 41; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword.

Yog (courtier): This genial lesser varumani accrued much favor at court by discovering a hoard of six fully-charged rudishva lesser power supplies. This meant a temporary return to service of the Nutri-Vore 2000 in 7-16, for which Yog was temporarily treated as a hero. Riding that popularity, Yog has tried to interest the court in ‘cleaning out’ the other denizens of the southern caves, including the ‘demon spider’ (7-58, a phase spider) that he claims haunts the area. As no one else has seen the ‘demon spider’, his efforts have thus far failed. Yog’s fifteen minutes of fame are ticking down, and he is anxious to reclaim the limelight through another bold deed. 

Yog, a lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 57; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: flail.

Janara (courtier): This hulking true varumani warrior is famous for having single-handedly defeated a band of heqeti hoppers on the floor of the chasm (see 9-1, but the action occurred near 9-75). She even brought two heqeti heads back to the court as trophies. Janara is not very smart, although she is a fine warrior; she doesn’t realize that her success was due almost entirely to luck. She spends his days constantly haranguing everyone – and especially new visitors – about the threat of the heqeti, and the necessity of ‘eliminating them once and for all!’ Although she may seem risible to the PCs, her achievements are legendary among the varumani, many of whom are coming around to her way of thinking. Unbeknownst to Janara, a witness to the battle exists (Cinna Minux, 7-122), and Thegan White-Mane (6-19) possesses a transcript of that witness’s account. If Thegan’s transcript were made known to the court, it would ruin Janara and likely halt varumani military expansion towards Level 9. 

Janara, a true varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision.Pillik, the goblin sub-chief, with six warriors (ordinary visitors): Pillik is on an official embassy from King Weskenim (SL4-22) and has been tasked with negotiating an alliance of equals between Weskenim and the thegn. Weskenim and Pillik would like to have a written document that delineates spheres of influence for both 
courts. Unfortunately, the tenor of the court is currently rather aggressive, and Varboka has become convinced that it is time to subjugate the goblins to varumani authority (see 7-30). Pillik is thus finding his task extremely difficult. Pillik is also supposed to be nosing out the whereabouts of Gislu the mystic (see 4-2). He is aware that Intef (see below) is up to no good, and is also aware that Varboka has granted many more audiences to Intef than to Pillik himself. In desperation, Pillik has hired the NPC group known as the Broom to assassinate Intef (see below).

Pillik, goblin sub-chief (as a hobgoblin): SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 1+1; HP 7; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8 (long sword). Possessions: long sword.

6 goblins: SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

The Broom, a mid- to high-level NPC band (ordinary visitors): This group of evil NPCs is led by the Wiskin fighter, Harold Good-Ears. They have valuable information about the location of Gislu the mystic (4-2), which they have sold to Pillik and are willing to sell to others. They also encountered and slew a small band of kaliyani on Level 8 (at 8-8); they have just learned that the thegn offers a bounty for kaliyani fangs, and are contemplating returning to that site to recover the fangs. They have tentatively agreed to assassinate Intef the deacon (see below) for Pillik, but have not yet moved on this task; indeed, they are contemplating betraying Pillik, if they can decide who would pay the most for information about the assassination contract. 

The Broom: see NPC appendix.

Arctos, a beastman sergeant, with six troopers (ordinary visitors): Reith, the junior overseer of the Troll Lifts (6-50), taunted some beastmen returning from the Arena about having one of their dog brothers, ‘stuffed and mounted, and with a collar.’ Tagma command rightly guessed that this was a reference to Rex, legendary faithful ‘First Hound’ and companion of Gennadius. When Reith refused to negotiate with the beastmen, or even show them the item, Tagma Command sent Arctos to formally petition the thegn to aid them in their recovery, even if it meant compelling Reith to hand over Rex. Arctos would also like very much to learn where Reith acquired Rex, and has a sizable stash of coin (3,000 gp) with which to hire adventurers to pursue this lead. If negotiations fail, Arctos is supposed to steal the object from Reith; he has little hope that such a theft would work, unless he were to hire a more proficient thief from outside the tagma.

1 beastman sergeant (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’: HD 2+2; HP 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 or 2-5. Special attacks: tactics. Possessions: ring mail and shield; spear; war hammer.

6 beastman troopers (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LN; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 1+1; HP: 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: tactics. Possessions: ring mail and shield; spears; short 
swords; short bows.

Intef, the Set deacon, with five Set guardsmen (ordinary visitors): Intef has been sent to the thegn’s court to try to persuade Varboka to join High Priestess Stephania (4-51) in an alliance, with the specific aim of eliminating both the beastmen and the goblins. Intef is a short (5’2”) and rather round man, but is equipped with a sharp mind and a silver tongue. It is due to his influence that Varboka is contemplating the subjugation of the goblins (although Intef actually wanted Varboka to kill them all). Pillik the goblin has recently hired the Broom (see above) to assassinate Intef.

Intef, a Set deacon (see new monsters), as a 6th-level Archontean cleric of Set: SZ M; AL LE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6; HP 42; #AT 1; Dmg 3-8 (mace +1). Possessions: Set armor +1 (see 
Arden Vul items); deacon’s was stick (see new magic items); footman’s mace +1; an amulet of protection against normal missiles (see new magic items); a potion of extra healing; a 
potion of glibness; a scroll of curse; and a gold holy symbol of Set (150 gp). Spells prayed for: command, cure light wounds (x2), cause fear, protection from good; chant, hold person, 
know alignment, resist fire, silence 15’ radius; animate dead, dispel magic, cause blindness; cause serious wounds.

4 Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 2nd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 18, 17, 15, 12; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow). Special defense: fanaticism. Possessions: red scale mail and wooden shield; footman’s maces; spears; light crossbows with 20 bolts.

Sable Granite, the dwarf, with his five dwarven comrades (special visitors): This band of well-armored dwarven fighters claims to have journeyed from Kazildor (see World of Archontos appendix) in order to re-appropriate certain ‘rightful’ heirlooms of the dwarven people, namely the hammer, tongs, and belt of the great smith, Zhorak (see 8-100). They are suspicious, dour, and tight-lipped, as dwarves usually are. Typically they stand to one side, with cloaks up, staring at newcomers and, eventually, interrogating new visitors about their knowledge of dwarven artifacts and/or Zhorak. For all of this, the ‘dwarves’ are impostors, as they are actually doppelgangers engaged in yet another skirmish in the age-old war between their people and the dwarves. Sable and his companions might sponsor an expedition in search of Zhorak’s forge, but might also merely follow adventurers and hope to ambush them. For stats, see table above.

Sable Granite, a doppelganger impersonating the real dwarven hero: SZ M; AL N; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 26; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12 or 5-8 (war hammer +3). Special attacks: surprise 4 in 6. 
Special defenses: immune to charm and sleep; saves as a 10th-level fighter. Special: ESP. Possessions: scale mail +3; potion of fire resistance; a war hammer +3; 2 potions of rock melting (see new magic items); and an inert dwarven life-stone (see new magic items) that once belonged to a dwarf named Korda Malachite.

5 doppelgangers, posing as the dwarven clansmen of Sable Granite: SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4; HP 29, 26, 25, 24, 23; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12 or 1-8 (battle axe) Special attacks: surprise 4 in 6. Special defenses: immune to charm and sleep; saves as a 10th-level fighter. Special: ESP. Possessions: chain mail; battle axes.

Gaius Christopher, a grizzled but polite knight commander of the Order of the Azure Shield, with two squires (special visitors): Gaius Christopher journeyed from the Azure Keep (AK-1) on a mission from the Lady Alexia, aka the Green Lady (Ak-2, and World of Archontos appendix). She entrusted the knight commander with an important message to Varboka, one offering equal lordship above and below the ground should Varboka help her recover the four lost artifacts of the archons of Arden Vul. She seeks the artifacts – the iron circlet of Ghanor (3-127A), the tablet of the Beacon (9-107), the bone ring of Jagri-Naz (5-74), and the 
ebon spear (SL5-13B) - ahead of her treacherous brother, Lord Burdock. Varboka is well aware of the rivalry between the siblings, and enjoys watching it play out. The thegn has already decided not to help her, mostly because he doesn’t want either sibling to re-acquire objects that might lead to another Archontean hegemony, but also because he has no idea where they might be. He hasn’t informed Gaius Christopher of his decision yet, as he enjoys 
watching the knight squirm. For stats, see table above.

13-16 true varumani courtiers (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 62, 61, 60(x3), 59(x3), 58(x3), 57, 57, 54, 53, 52; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-
handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword.

5-8 lesser varumani courtiers (see new monsters): lesser varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 60, 59, 58, 57, 55, 54, 52, 50; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 
or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

Sir Prudence, the Sun-Scarred Knight (see new monsters): for stats, see 7-76A.

Beuvon, the varlet: for stats, see 7-76A.

Visitors, in 4-8 groups: determine using tables above.

4 ogre guards: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 31, 29, 28, 27; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

### 7-76: The Troll Market, aka the Cave of Blood

This large cavern is famous for its history as well as for its function in the present. About 230 years ago it was the site of the famous (to varumani) defeat of the Archontean expeditionary force under Adrienic at the hands of the then-thegn, Girvala. As such it is venerated by the varumani as an iconic symbol of varumani prowess while it is known, by reputation only, to the Archonteans as a symbol of tragic, hubristic failure. To those unversed in history, however, the cavern is also the site of the Troll Market, which is the vernacular name for the public exchange sponsored by Varboka the thegn. Visitors may browse in one of eight or so permanent trading booths, or can strike deals along the platforms with more temporary salesmen. 

The natural cavern is about 50’ tall. Running through the center of the cavern is a set of wooden platforms that rise 20’ from the floor, and which are supported by seven massive stone pillars (marked by the pillar sign on the map). The walls of the cave are thick with creepers and the entire place echoes with the chirp of cave insects. Side caves run along the north and south walls, and these are connected to the main set of platforms by rope bridges. 

The permanent booths are located in the side caves, while the central platform is where visitors and varumani alike crowd about buying, selling, and trading goods and information. In addition to the main side caves, four additional side caves hold the secret to the varumani success against Adrienic: four rudishva-era point defense arrays, which may be controlled remotely from area 7-11.

The Cavern Floor

The floor of the cavern lies 20’ below the platforms. Those poking around on the floor will quickly discover hundreds of human skeletons, all stripped clean by the insect life that lives here. These are the remains of five cohorts of the II Scutarii (i.e., the Sheepshead Rangers) and much of the third cohort of the Imperial Tagmata (the Able Ones), both of which marched to their demise here under the foolish orders of Archon Adrienic about 230 years ago. The Archontean soldiers were caught in a web of laser fire from the point defense arrays (areas 7-76K) and annihilated. Although most of the valuables were stripped from the corpses in the aftermath of the defeat, careful searching can turn up the following (3-6 turns 
searching per item):

D8 Item
1 A purse with 37 sp and 15 gp
2 A battered silver helmet in the shape of a sheep’shead (55 gp for metal, 175 gp as a curio)
3 An oliphant carved with the insignia “III Cohort. Able Ones,” worth 75 gp or 200 gp to a collector [GM Note: a reference to the 3rd cohort of the Imperial tagmata] 4 A pair of silver belt fittings embossed with the heads of sheep (10 gp each)
5 A badly decayed officer’s baculus with tarnished silver tips, worth 60 gp
6 An almost completely ruined parchment diary. The owner was “Tull[iaros] [polemarch] of the II Scutarii”. 
Among the only readable bits is this, one of the final entries: “Why must we suffer the incompetence of aristocrats who fancy themselves soldiers? Adrienic believes his ‘grand strategy’ will bring the trolls to their knees. Yet he adopts no tactical plan worthy of the name, and will not listen to my pleas. Scouts and skirmishers? Unnecessary, according to A. The best plan? Marching straight into the trollish domain in a solid phalanx, as if we were maneuvering on the plains before Arcturos. May the gods forfend us from disaster! I will do my part, as my oath to the Emperor requires, but I fear the worst.” 
7 A half-charged rudishva lesser power supply (see new technological items)
8 A still-usable imperial gladius (short sword)

The Troll Market

Unlike the more heavily regulated Forum of Set, the thegn imposes no formal laws or rules to govern activity in the Troll Market save an unwritten but widely-known prohibition against lethal violence. Commerce takes place in the fixed ‘booths’ (caves 7-76A to 7-76J) as well as along the platforms. Those using the Troll Market include the varumani, adventurers exploring the Halls, representatives of other factions, and the occasional unusual visitor, whether from outside Arden Vul or from the caves that lead deeper into the earth. It should be noted that the thegn provides no accommodations to visitors to the Market; those who need to stay overnight typically climb to the cavern floor and sleep among the bones. 

At any given moment, the following are present at the Troll Market:

A. Wardens of the Market

Three tough, ring-mail clad, true varumani warriors patrol the market under the command of Layela Three-Tufts. Layela and his ‘gals’ (the other two wardens are female) are well known to habitués of the market, and greet regulars jovially. If anything they are more likely to side with existing merchants in a dispute, and like nothing more than to haul miscreants away and kick them down the Dread Risers (7-2). That said, they interfere only when matters become serious and blood is about to be shed. 

Layela Three-Tufts and 2 other true varumani (see new monsters), wardens of the market: SZ L; AL LN; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 63, 62, 58; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 6-24 (two-handed sword, 2-20+4). Special defenses: surprised only on 1 in 6; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; immune to cold, poison, charm, hold, feeblemind, confusion, and other mind-affecting magic; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: huge two-handed sword; ring mail.

B. Food Vendors

Four lesser varumani vendors wander the platforms, offering delicacies to the hungry. The source of the food is not always clear, and regulars know better than to ask. Each vendor carries about 150 sp and 20 gp. The delicacies on offer are these:

Food Item Price
Rat on a stick 5 sp/rat
Candied fruit 1 gp/glob
Baked insects 5 cp each, or 15 sp/lb
Toasted mushrooms 5 sp/skewer-full
Green friend (see new flora) 3 gp per 3’ strand

4 lesser varumani (see new monsters) food vendors: SZ L; AL LE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 59, 55, 53, 51; #AT 3 or 1; Dmg 3-6/3-6/4-10 or 7-22 (club, 3-18+4). Special defenses: 33% resistant to mind-affecting magic; immune to cold and poison; save as 8th-level fighters or 8th-level magic users, whichever is better; regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision. Possessions: club.

C. Peddlers

These are wandering merchants with neither the money nor inclination to rent one of the official market booths. At any mo-ment there are 0-3 such peddlers hawking their wares on the platforms. As compared to the market goods for sale in the booths, the peddlers typically offer stranger and fewer goods. Sample peddlers include the following (but the GM may also use those peddlers detailed at 6-28 or SL4-40F).

Foglifter the Seer 

Foglifter has the gift of second sight, and makes a living reading futures – and occasionally the past – for those willing to pay. He wears greasy, once-elegant, lemon-yellow silken robes and a floppy purple hat.
Personality: Distracted and distant, with a flair for dramatic pronouncements complete with gestures and small smoke and pyrotechnic effects.
Reputation and/or relations with Factions: Tolerated by all, except the goblins, who are embarrassed by his theatrics. The varumani in particular love his act, and many lesser varumani line up for readings. Harassing Foglifter would incur significant enmity from most of the sentient factions of the Halls.
Secret? None, although he knows an awful lot about politics and the personalities of the various factions.
Available Wealth: He swiftly converts coin to gems, so he has only 55 sp and 129 gp in his purse. But in his pack are assorted gems worth 6,500 gp.
Might Buy: Nothing
Goods for sale: Three levels of reading, corresponding to augury, identify, and speak with dead. He charges 200 gp for the first two, and 400 gp for the third. He accepts goods in kind.

Foglifter the Seer (male goblin): SZ S; AL LE; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 1-1; HP 5; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6.

Aruna the Gatherer 
Aruna travels the relatively safe portions of the halls seeking out bits of Archontean ephemera. Like a magpie, he is attracted to small shiny bits of the past. Aruna is a stooped, thin man who dresses in leather armor and grey wool.
Personality: Dull and introspective, with a mumbling voice. He lacks the salesman’s instinct, and hence is often overlooked.
Reputation and/or relations with Factions: Has no reputation, positive or negative, and no support from any leader.Secret? He has heard of a new faction (the Priscians) and is searching for information about their location (i.e., 9-58 to 9-64).
Available Wealth: 411 sp, 218 gp, 1,200 gp in gems
Might Buy: Sortian eyes (see new magic items), information about Priscian sites or Sortian artifacts (provided directions come with the information)
Companions: Peller, a deaf-mute fighter.
Goods for Sale: 1-4 species of exotic mushroom; a skein of spider silk; a still-moving fragment of living mosaic, showing a tiny (2”-square) portion of 6-154; eight octagonal platinum coins; a guard cap (see new magic items); an Alexia’s useful pole (see new magic items); an entire text of the Litany of Light (see Arden Vul books); and a hand-written copy of the inscription at 6-147, which he will note came from ‘the icy hall of the Lady’. 

Aruna the Gatherer, a 3rd-level male Thorcin thief: SZ M; AL CN; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 3; HP 14; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (short sword) or 1-4 (daggers). Abilities: STR 11, INT 12, WIS 10, DEX 17, 
CON 11, CHA 14. Thief skills: PP 45%, OL 43%, F/RT 30%, MS 32%, HS 25%, HN 15%, CW 87%. Possessions: leather armor +1; short sword; throwing daggers; grapple and rope; brooch of confident action (see new magic items); ring of shield (see new magic items).

Peller, 2nd-level male Thorcin fighter, deaf and mute: SZ M; AL LN; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 17; #AT 1; Dmg 4-9 (spear), 5-11 (broadsword). Abilities: STR 18/75, INT 9, WIS 10, DEX 
12, CON 16, CHA 6. Possessions: scale mail; spear; broadsword; purse with 127 gp. 

Hakreon the Apothecary 
Hakreon is a genial, outgoing, wandering healer. He dresses in a dirty white robe and sports a blue turban.
Personality: Friendly and eager-to-please. Looks puzzled if asked about himself; it’s apparent he knows nothing of his own past.
Reputation and/or relations with Factions: Viewed with suspicion by the cult of Set, but tolerated as an odd holy man by all others.
Secret? Hakreon was a 5th-level cleric of Ardenia Tessaeron, but he has no memory of his life prior to the past year. The reason is that he fell prey to the memory erasing trap located in Level 8 (8-111). Ardenia Tessaeron would be pleased to have his memory restored, but this can only be accomplished by destroying the appropriate figurine in 8-126.
Available Wealth: Almost none (75 sp, 55 gp), as he gives most of his money away to the needy
Might Buy: Nothing

## Level 7: 7-76a to 7-76j

* These small side caves connect to the main cavern of the Troll Market.
	* Each has a flat, sandy floor and, at minimum, one wooden table and an open wooden box.
	* Merchants rent the cave (25 gp/month plus 5% of all sales).
	* Most of the caves have long-term tenants, and boast extra furnishings.

### 7-76a: Sir Prudence’s Quarters

* The thegn grudgingly assigned this cave to Sir Prudence (see 7-75) once it became apparent that the Sun-Scarred Knight intended to stay for some time.
	* Varboka complains about the ‘loss of revenue’ from having a mercantile booth devoted to a private residence, but this booth never attracted much business due to its distant location along the platforms.
* Sir Prudence and his varlet, Beuvon, reside here when they are not engaged in the business of the Troll Court.
	* The thegn provided two simple cots, a pile of mangy furs, and two battered chairs for the visitors.
	* Sir Prudence has added:
		* A beautiful yellow silk curtain (100 gp) across the entryway, providing privacy.
		* A pair of thick, padded quilts embroidered with bizarre scenes from the mysterious past of the Sun-Scarred Knights

	* Sir Prudence has secured a leather satchel to the ceiling of the cave.
		* Copies of the Litany of Light, the Lay of Marius Invictus, and the Canticle of Arcane Knowledge (books); a map showing the route through Level 8 to the citadel of the Sun-Scarred knights (SL10A-14 and SL10B; the route runs from 8-1 to 8-3, 8-28, 8-29, through the secret door and down the tunnel to 8-62, 8-61, 8-58, 8-57 and 8-56, and thence to SL10A-2).

### 7-76c: Relics and Curios

* Proprietor: Chaudri the Echophont
* Personality: Tall, willowy, and innocuous, Chaudri’s ethereal air is the root of the fake ghost stories told by the men of the Sign of the Broken Head (AV-22). Chaudri dresses in a flowing white robe tied with a blue silk sash; he affects a yellow pointed hat and gestures dramatically at his merchandise with an ivory wand (non-magic).
* Reputation and/or relations with Factions: He is considered an effete idiot by the varumani, who have little time for his strange artifacts; the goblins love his routines, though; the Set cult tolerates him.
* Secret? Most of his blithe demeanor is an act, as Chaudri is extremely clever. He is acting for the Collegium of Cinder, tasked to locate Tikun Thane (SL3-2) for the Cold Fires (the ruling circle of the collegium). Few know he has arcane abilities.
* Lockbox: 379 sp, 1,801 gp; 5,450 gp in gems

* Goods for Sale: A good selection of inscriptions (both actual stones and rubbings of them); statuary fragments; small statuettes; pieces of furniture, including an ebony desk (575 gp); unusual or archaic weapons; codices (but not spell-books); a full range of Sortian eyes at 150% of base price (see new magic items); a token of Arden (see Arden Vul items), for which he wants 1,500 gp; one of the fish-shaped control rods to the eggs found in 4-85 (asking price 250 gp); an iron key (to area SL8-1); and 1-4 common miscellaneous magic items.

* Other Features of Cave
	* He has installed, with the thegn’s permission, an iron portcullis across the mouth of his cave. During business hours the door-sized entryway is open. When Chaudri grows tired or must depart, the gate is shut and wizard locked. He keeps his lockbox hidden in the drawer of his large ebony desk.
	* Secret Door (south): opens only from the south. Chaudri does not know it exists.

### 7-76d: Jewelry and Gems

* Proprietor: Jordan Rivulus, aka Cold Jordan 
* Personality: Jordan is a handsome, raven-haired woman of about 30, who dresses in black tunic and black pantaloons. She lives up to her nickname, however, as she is cold and distant, and suspicious of all transactions. She has a set of scales and weights, and most of her business comes from appraisals and exchange of coins for gems.
* Reputation and/or relations with Factions: Tolerated by all factions. Regulars to the market know that even though Jordan has been robbed a couple of times over the years, she somehow always manages to recover her goods.
* Secret? She is a spy for the Guild of Service (4-7), reporting directly to Gunnar, one of the guildmasters of the Guild of Service. As she has not seen Gunnar in some time (see 4-10 and 4-64), she is growing anxious.
* Lockbox: 9,874 gp; 359 sp; six vials of poison.
* Might Buy: Jewelry or gems, at 75% of list value. She will also purchase poison, but only from trusted sources
* Goods for Sale: 8 pieces of jewelry (110% of list value); gems (110% of list value); money-changing services

* Other Features of Cave
	* Jordan keeps her goods in three, long, narrow metal chests (2’x2’x4’) that she locks up each night (-5% to pick, poison needle traps).
	* She hangs a simple rope across the opening to the cave to indicate her shop is closed.
	* Regulars know, however, that efforts to sneak into the shop while Jordan sleeps are unwise. Indeed, she has a clever, near-invisible, set of threads attached to the rope; these are attached to a set of bells mounted inside the cave mouth.
	* In the rare case when her stall is robbed, Jordan uses her ring of the stalker (new) to track down the culprits; to date the stalker(s) have always managed to eliminate the thieves and return her goods.

### 7-76e: Weapons and Armor

* Proprietor: Skalla Ironmonger 
* Personality: Skalla is a typical Wiskin: tall, fair, with reddish-blond hair, long mustaches, and big muscles. He is a man of few words during working hours, preferring shrugs and eyebrow lifts to words; after he closes shop, though, he likes to drink horns of ale with his friend, Big Jacoby (7-76B). At that point he is quite voluble, full of boasts, challenges, and epic songs about obscure heroes of legend (e.g. Larel One-Eye, Jacinth the Rose, Chramn the Hunter [4-97B], and legendary Wiskin, Olaf White-Beard).
* Reputation and/or relations with Factions: The varumani love him, especially when he drinks, and especially love to challenge him to arm-wrestling contests. Although he always loses, his determination and good sportsmanship have won him lots of friends. He is unknown to the Set cult and goblin court.
* Secret? He is a skald, and is looking for material for his own epic tale. He wouldn’t mind a few epic adventures, as well, so long as they starred him.
* Lockbox: 3,479 sp; 6,731 gp
* Might Buy: Exceptionally finely made spears, axes or blades, or unusual or ceremonial exemplars of the same. He might buy an enchanted blade (up to +2) at 80% value, although he might need time to raise the cash

	* He also has a battle axe +1, a long sword +1, and a spear +2 (Earthfriend), but will only sell these treasures to someone he likes well.
	* His price for the spear is 10,000 gp. Unbeknownst to Skalla, the spear is actually the legendary Earthfriend (see new magic items). Should Skalla sell the spear and then learn of its identity, he will do everything in his power to recover it.
* Companions: 2 Wiskin assistants, 2nd-level fighters

* Other Features of Cave

### 7-76f: Scribe and Scrolls

* Proprietor: Hallar Ellagelsson
* Personality: As a son of Lady Ellagel of the realm of Gallador (see World of Archontos appendix), albeit by a human lover, Hallar has significant status among his own people. Hallar has honey-gold, shoulder-length hair and penetrating green eyes; he favors brightly striped tunics worn over his elven chain, and loose purple trousers. He is inquisitive to a fault, and likes nothing more than to subject his patrons to close questioning about their experiences in the halls.
* Reputation and/or relations with Factions: Mostly treated with suspicion as too nosy and arrogant for his own good.
* Secret? He vowed to his mother to locate his half-brother, Erist Ellagelsson, who has been missing in Arden Vul for about 75 years. Unbeknownst to Hallar, Erist is currently petrified at area SL6-5. Hallar will not easily reveal his quest, but will be most grateful – as will his mother – for news of his sibling and/or for his restoration.

	* The thegn only authorizes their use in the case of a clear and present threat to the varumani people.

	* Leads to the point defense control chamber.

## Level 7: 77 - 84

### 7-77: Barracks of the Ogre Guards

* A small tribe of ogres inhabits this chamber. The ogres serve happily as petty guards for the varumani, and are paid well for their troubles.
	* About the only grievance the ogres have is that they must provide 2 infants per year to the thegn, who trades them to Weskenim the goblin king to use as the latter’s eunuch guards (see SL4-25). 
*  The chamber is undecorated, and smells rather rank.
	* The ogres have a single tripod of heating (new) and two immense barrels, one of water and one of sour wine.
	* Their ‘beds’ are piles of hides and furs.
	* A war chest contains 5,397 sp and 1,118 gp.

9 ogres: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 31, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 25, 24, 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

### 7-78: Upper Temple of the Heqeti

This ancient heqeti temple to Kauket was important in antiquity before it was destroyed by the rudishva. The original complex included current areas 7-91 and 7-76, but those areas were devastated by the rudishva in their first wars with the heqeti, leaving only this badly dilapidated set of ruins (7-78 to 7-84). In the past several decades, however, the heqeti have returned and have begun restoring this area. 

Area 7-78 is the temple proper. It encompasses a tall cavern (40’) dominated by a crumbling stone ziggurat (7-79) that sits in the midst of a foetid pool. The entire cavern is covered by the effects of a hallow spell (see new spells) cast on the altar atop the ziggurat; this spell adds +2 to all rolls made by those of chaotic evil alignment, and imposes a -2 penalty to all rolls by good creatures.GM Note: The heqeti forces on Level 10 can be weakened by removing the evil hallow effect from the upper temple. To remove that effect is difficult: it might be accomplished by having good-aligned PCs cast their own version of hallow, or by having a high priest of a good deity cleanse the area through a set of costly and time-consuming rituals (15,000 gp in materials and a two-week period of time). For the consequences of removing the evil hallow effect, see the level introduction to Level 10.

The walls of the chamber are pitted and covered with strange purple lichen and yellow-green shelf fungus, while the floor is covered by a thin layer of sand. Two glowing fire-beetle abdomens hang from iron rods by the east end of the pool, providing minimal light to that area.

Two niches stand 15’ above the cavern floor near the east exit. A pair of heqeti hopping dead (see new monsters) with spears stands in each niche. Close examination of the wall under the southern niche reveals hand and foot-holds leading up to that niche; these features are discovered as if they were secret doors. The cavern is dominated by a dark pool of mostly-stagnant water. The pool is 13’ deep and offers a mild but unpleasant reek of rotting vegetation. A stone causeway leads up 10’ via a series of shallow stone steps to the foot of the ziggurat (7-79). 

Six heqeti chosen on riding salamanders (see new monsters for both) patrol the cavern, and keep a close eye out for the warning salamanders from 7-84. The chosen swiftly intercept any intruders, while calling for assistance from those on the lesser ziggurat (7-79). Should a battle royale break out here, the other six chosen arrive from 7-82 after 4 rounds.

The Tongue (i.e., chief priest) of this temple is Caudatssa, a heqeti builder (see new monsters). Initially Caudatssa will be found at the ziggurat at 7-79, either atop it with a sacrifice (50%), or within it in the summoning chamber (50%).

Secret Door (southern niche, leading to 7-83): The door is normal to find and opens by physically sliding stone panel into a slot in the wall. 

4 heqeti hopping dead (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 3; HP 19, 17, 16, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as ghasts; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells.

Special attacks: hop; acid tongue (1-6 acid damage); +1 damage due to STR; toxic skin (paralysis for 1-2 rounds). Special defenses: psionic resistance; immune to sleep, charm, hold and water/ice.

Treasure: 
Each heqeti has 11 gp and 7 sp.

### 7-79: Lesser Heqeti Ziggurat

This forbidding structure is the heart of the revived heqeti temple. Its interior is formed by huge granite blocks, while the sheathing and steps are oily, pebbled soapstone. Steep steps on each side of the ziggurat climb 25’ above the level of the surrounding pool to a central platform. Halfway up the west side a 7’-square opening leads to an inner chamber. Atop the ziggurat stands a 6’x3’x4’ altar.Altar: The altar is a shaped piece of soapstone resembling a salamander on four legs. Leather restraints allow a sacrifice to be strapped onto the altar. A hole in the altar allows blood from such sacrifices to spill down through the altar into a copper basin on the ziggurat top; a hole in the basin leads to the summoning chamber 
inside the ziggurat. Three sharp copper knives, a pair of copper picks, and a set of copper nesting bowls rest atop the altar. Two large violet garnets are set into the altar at one end, forming the eyes of the ‘salamander’.

Inner Chambers (not mapped)
The interior of the ziggurat is comprised of three chambers. The 7’-square entrance tunnel leads straight to the summoning chamber, whose dimensions are 14’x14’x14’. A 4’-wide side corridor leads down 30’ from the entrance passage via a narrow staircase to two 10x10’ chambers set in the bedrock. The summoning chamber has a hole in the ceiling that leads up to the top of the ziggurat; blood from sacrifices drips down the hole and pools in a 
shallow depression in the center of the chamber. The depression is surrounded by a five pointed star gouged into the floor and carefully filled with crushed shell. Two iron sconces hold tallow candles. From this chamber the tongue and weavers are able to summon keqemandri (see new monsters). Of the two lower chambers, one is a holding cell for sacrifices, with iron shackles set into the wall. The other is a utility room for the weavers and builder. Currently the holding cell is occupied by Lyxander, a human adventurer and member of the ill-fated NPC group, the Cleaners. The Cleaners found the Drowned Canyon (SL6) and then came up the tunnel to 7-86. Surprised by the basilisks, they fled to 7-84, where they were overwhelmed by the heqeti and taken prisoner. The utility room contains the adventurer’s gear, plus a pile of dried human skins, a sack with unidentifiable jerky, an extra set of copper sacrificial instruments; and a stone chest containing the treasure of the temple.
Ceremonies: Two rituals take place at the ziggurat: 1) the sacrifice of prisoners to Kauket, and 2) the summoning of keqemandri demons to aid the heqeti. When the PCs arrive, there is a 50% chance that the tongue, Caudatssa, is performing a sacrifice atop the ziggurat. Otherwise he is found in the summoning chamber within the ziggurat. The weavers accompany Caudatssa at all times. Should PCs arrive during a sacrifice, Caudatssa will immediately dash to the summoning chamber; there he spends 5 rounds summoning a keqemander demon while the weavers confront the PCs. If the leaders are already in the summoning chamber, they complete the summoning before moving en masse to the top of the ziggurat for combat.

GM Note: In the case of a combat that turns clearly against the heqeti, Caudatssa attempts to flee towards 7-83, where he jumps into the teleport well to alert the rest of his people.

### 7-80: Pool

### 7-82: Chambers of the Tongue

These three caves constitute the living quarters for the heqeti who serve the upper temple. The westernmost cave is home to the two weavers; the middle cave is the residence of Caudatssa, the tongue; the larger, eastern cave is a residence for the other heqeti.

Western Cave: The weavers (for stats see 7-79) have a ‘bead curtain’ made of bits of shell that offers a bit of privacy. They have a full human skeleton tied together with wire and hanging from a hook, on which they practice spells. A low (3’-tall) slab of inclined rock acts as a writing desk; on it sit their two spell books, the leaves and binding of which are made of human flesh. They also have an art-naïf statuette of Rimmaq-Isfet shaped much like a slug: a 10”-long piece of granite, shaped and rounded, with eyes and a mouth opening on one end. It detects as evil, but has no powers.

Center Cave: Caudatssa, the tongue (see 7-79), commands the revived lesser ziggurat from this cave (even though he is rarely present here). A pile of dried pondweed serves as his resting spot. On a flat rock is the partly dissected corpse of the last sacrifice, a human; a set of finely-honed copper knives lies next to the body. Caudatssa has a curious interest in the inner workings of humans, and he is always eager to open up prisoners or the remains of 
sacrifices. Two banners made of human skin lashed to a circle of bones rest against one wall. A large white teardrop is painted on the first [GM: a symbol of Kauket], while a thin black circle on a white field appears on the second [GM: a symbol of Rimmaq-Isfet]. Caudatssa also retains Sir Mendacity’s solar ring (see new magic items). 

Eastern Cave: This large cave houses twelve heqeti chosen. At any given moment, six are on patrol in 7-78, while the other six relax here. The heqeti have flattened one of the walls and painted it white; atop the white field is a sinuous tongue [GM: another Rimmaq-Isfet symbol]. The cave contains twelve lumps of sand and pondweed, and a wooden post on which hangs a decomposing varumani corpse that the heqeti use for combat practice. In one 
of the ‘nests’ is a hand-carved circular piece of bone; it serves as an amulet of health, albeit only for those of an evil alignment. Searching the others produces six pieces of carved amber.

6 heqeti chosen (see new monsters), as 6th-level fighters: SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 6; HP 45, 43, 40, 39, 38, 35; #AT 2; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 1-6 (bite).

## Level 7: 119 - 132 (Domain of the Vampire, Cinna Minux)

This cluster of chambers forms the current lair of the dangerousand ancient vampire lord, Cinna Minux. Cinna was one of the first Archonteans recruited to the Order of the Sun-Scarred Knights by the order’s reclusive master, Master Malachite (SL10A-32), and the last to have been offered the ‘gift’ of vampirism by the master. In his pride, Cinna accepted, but over time grew to chafe at the master’s strict and overly lawful regulations. He eventually renounced the order and its principles and fled, hiding himself in the ancient Archontean shrine complex in which he had once served. Here he works hard to conceal his presence from the Knights, even while continuing to hunt (carefully, and quietly) on the chasm floor 
(Level 9).

 He has been exceptionally careful in revealing his presence, and few know even rumors of his existence. The bestial and lesser varumani know the area to be haunted, but know nothing of the cause of that ‘haunting’. Malachite has not told subsequent generations of Sun-Scarred Knights about Cinna’s origins, and they know him only as a ‘dangerous undead lord’. Cinna has built up a small circle of undead, plus a few lesser vampires, whom he dominates ruthlessly, imposing his own rigid regulations upon them (mostly, those have to do with never leaving Cinna’s domain).

 Due to his age, Cinna’s charm abilities are more powerful than those of a standard vampire; the duration of any successful charm by Cinna is 10x that of the standard vampire. Cinna regularly travels throughout the halls in gaseous form; occasionally he stops to charm NPCs and monsters throughout Arden Vul. These charmed allies provide Cinna with information about who has passed, what their goals might be, and so forth. Some of his charmed sources of information include: Gillen, Tressa and Quade (4-180), Gog (5-2), Killik (5-46), Riglon (5-54), Gorlen (6-5), Virgoolian the chemist (6-28), Razor Face (6-61), Olaf the bee-whisperer (8-73), Muq (8-151), and Lithiric (9-22). He has also charmed, as necessary, 
numerous ordinary beastmen, goblins, Set guardsmen, lizardmen, and adventurers.

Within his domain, Cinna is aggressive and dangerous, and uses all of his resources to destroy any party that sets foot in that domain. Of course, should the PCs prove too powerful, he swiftly resorts to gaseous form and flees to his sanctum (7-122) through the holes he has drilled in the floor of that chamber.

 Cinna’s evil casts a pall over the entire area. That pall produces two effects: 1) it reduces good clerics’ chances of turning undead by 2, and 2) it imposes a penalty of 1 to all saving throws made by good characters. Should Cinna be slain, the evil pall disappears in 1-3 days.

When the area is first approached, Cinna is holding court in 7-128 among his minions. He is instantly aware of an attack on any of the minions of his domain; if such an attack occurs, 
he immediately disperses his remaining lesser minions to soften up intruders’ defenses. He then plans ambushes with his greater minions among the hallways and shrines of his domain.

Cinna’s Minions:
Cinna has sired two vampires, whom he dominates and employs as assistants. He has also charmed several adventurers and a few monsters. Finally, he has dominated a trio of wights and a small pack of ghouls. He has issued strict orders to the charmed creatures, forbidding them from leaving his domain without permission. All of the minions fight gladly for their master. Should PCs enter the domain in a way that attracts attention – e.g., by noisily fighting with the ogres at 7-119, the ghouls at 7-123, or the wights at 7-130 – then Cinna will order the remainder of his minions to move into action against the intruders. They attempt to force the PCs into 7-128, where Cinna’s entire force can participate in the assault. It is 
possible, however, for PCs to stealthily enter the domain via area 7-121 (or via one of the other entrances, if silence is employed); in this case, the minions will be found in their usual locations, and Cinna could be caught by surprise in his hall (7-128). If Cinna captures any PCs, there is a 50% he will attempt to charm one or more low-intelligence characters into his service, and a 15% chance he will make one into a vampire.

### 7-119: Spiral Stairs Up to SL7-31 

* The stone spiral stairs here lead up 425’ to SL7-31 in the Flooded Vaults.
* Three ogres are cheerfully roasting a trio of fish-men (new) on a spit over a roaring fire.
	* They have been charmed by Cinna Minux (7-122) and are stationed to watch for intruders from above.

* If confronted by a powerful-looking party, one of the three vigorously beats a cowbell to alert Cinna and his other minions to the threat.
* 50% chance to notice combat in 7-130.
	* If they do, one reports to Cinna in 7-128 while the others head north to lay an ambush from the corridor leading west.

3 charmed ogres: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 27, 25, 22; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

### 7-120: Shrine to Ptah

The ancient Archontean shrine to Ptah is in remarkably good condition. The chamber is tall (20’), and clad entirely in green marble. To the south is a cult statue of the god, standing on a dais. A well-appointed forge occupies the center and northern part of the chamber. Painted onto the green walls are images of farmers engaged in every sort of agricultural activity, one per 5’ section of marble. Looming behind each farmer is the face of Ptah, handsome and bearded. The one exception is the north wall, which is devoted to an enormous high-relief carving of bearded Ptah

Statue of Ptah: The statue of Ptah is 9’ tall and stands on a 3’ dais. He takes the form of a standing man, tightly wrapped in a thin shroud, holding three scepters across his chest. The statue is white marble, save for the head, which is polychromed green marble. His head is impassive, with blue eyes, black eyebrows, and a black beard. The three scepters – two held in the right hand, and one in the left – are a was stick, a djed pillar, and an ankh. A lawful good cleric who invokes Ptah (even if he/she follows a different god) hears the following words rumble like an earthquake through the chamber: “Champion of Order and Creation, choose your reward: power, life, or stability.” The cleric has 3 rounds to remove one of 
the three scepters; after the three rounds, the magic ends and none of the scepters can be removed. 

The was stick is shaped like one of the Set was sticks (see new magic items), that is, like a curved head on a straight body, with a forked bottom. In the hands of a lawful good cleric, it functions as a rod of striking with 20 charges (albeit only usable by LG clerics).

The djed pillar appears as a rod formed of concentric rings of polished copper, starting with a ring 1” in diameter and ending with one that is 6” in diameter. In the hands of a LG cleric, it acts as a potent enchanted mace known as the creator’s breath (see new magic items).

The ankh appears as a 2’-long copper ankh, incised with lapis. In the hands of a lawful good cleric it functions as rod of resurrection (with 10 charges).

Ptah’s Field: Most of the northern half of the chamber is devoted to a remarkable site known in antiquity as “Ptah’s Field”. The field is an area of loamy dirt about 5’ deep, from which grow gorgeous specimens of wheat and corn. A gentle breeze blows constantly from the large carving of Ptah on the north wall, except for ten minutes of every hour, when the breath turns into a gentle rain. The crops are without disease or weeds, and can easily be harvested, threshed and ground into flour using tools and a stone that stand in the center of the chamber. If the crops are harvested, a new set will have grown back within 2 weeks. It takes an hour to thresh the harvest, and another hour to grind it into flour. One harvest can 
produce 5 lb of flour. If made into bread, the flour is quite valuable: one loaf not only provides all food needs for a day, it also cures 2-12 HP. 

Treasure:
Ptah’s grain (see above); possibility of an enchanted ‘scepter’.

### 7-121: Deserted Chamber

* Eastern door (unlocked) and western door (locked).
* This former administrative office is filled with junk.
	* Broken desks and chairs, shreds of parchment, pieces of equipment, etc.
		* A clear path runs between the two doors.
* A poltergeist inhabits this chamber.
	* Cinna Minux could easily remove it, but elected to leave it as a barrier against varumani exploration of his domain.  The bestial varumani are duly terrified it (see 7-100), and have decided (rightly) that the area is haunted.

1 poltergeist: SZ M; AL LE; AC 10; MV 60’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 3, 2; #AT 0; Dmg special. Special attacks: throw object, a hit causes fear (throws as a 5 HD creature). Special defenses: invisible; silver, or +1 or better weapons to hit.

### 7-122: Lair of the Vampire, Cinna Minux

The final 15’ of the staircase that rises from 7-119 to this hall has been blocked with rubble (stone bits and pieces of furniture). It would take several hours of hard labor to move all the debris. 

Cinna Minux has made a sanctum out of this ancient Archontean convocation hall, a site where the priests of the various temples and shrines used to meet to discuss business and settle disputes. Cinna enters and exits the lair in gaseous form through one of several holes he drilled in the floor of 7-122; these holes emerge in the ceiling of the corridor that passes beneath the convocation hall. Should Cinna be encountered elsewhere and driven to 0 HP, he is forced into gaseous form and retreats to this chamber, where his coffin lies. 

The hall was once very grand, with frescoes of all the ancient Archontean gods lining the walls above a set of tiered benches. The frescoes are faded, but still visible and depict, in addition to Thoth and Set, Horus, Wadjet, Sobek, Besa, Osiris, Isis, Jael, Anubis, Tiamat, and Ptah, each in their iconic poses. The benches rise steeply from the central space, where once a speaking rostrum stood; now, however, the central space holds the sarcophagus/coffin of Cinna Minux. 

The sarcophagus is made of fine marble and unadorned save for an inscription in Mithric that reads, ‘Cinna Minux. First Knight.’ A set of 10 ½”-diameter holes are drilled in the lid, which can only be budged by making an open doors roll. The interior of the sarcophagus contains a 3” layer of dirt and Cinna’s emergency stash of yellow topazes inside a red-silk bag.

Surrounding the sarcophagus are various treasures that Cinna has accumulated over the centuries: a 3’-tall silver statue of a maiden (900 gp); a rosewood and ebony escritoire inlaid 
with ivory (1,200 gp); a silk and ivory canopy, such as might be carried above a dignitary in a procession (350 gp); a settee carved from a single piece of maple, carved with images of lions, tigers, and bears (250 gp); an armor rack with a full set of imperial field plate (see Arden Vul items); a Theodorus’s bed of convenient respite (see new magic items) in full-sized mode; a set of six oak dinner chairs on the backs of which is carved the seal of the old archons of Arden Vul (150 gp each); and several codices, including Symbols of Power, the Twelve Labors of Arden, Words and Symbols: an attempt to understand the symbols of the old ones, Thirty-Seven Quips of Balak the Sage, Tales of Larel One-Eye, and Sixteen Steps to 
Successful Administration (see Arden Vul books for all). It should be noted that these objects are all (mostly) bulky and require much labor to move.

Cinna Minux, ancient vampire, formerly a 10th-level male Archontean fighter: SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 120’, 180’ flying (Class B); HD 8+3; HP 59; #AT 1, or 3/2; Dmg 5-10, or 8-15

bats; immune to charm, hold, sleep; +1 or better weapons to hit. Due to his age, Cinna’s charm power has a duration of 10x that of normal vampires. He possesses the intelligent enchanted scimitar, Cers (see new magic items), which he can wield as follows: #AT 3/2, Dmg 8-15.

Treasure:

Sarcophagus: 20 golden yellow topaz gems (500 gp each), and a full set of six colored glass activation squares (see Thothian teleportation rings in new magic items).

Chamber: numerous bulky valuables (see above).

### 7-123: Badly Damage Shrine to Osiris

* This former shrine to Osiris suffered massive structural damage along the south wall, which collapsed, leaving a scree leading down 10’ to the large cavern at 7-113 and 7-112.
	* Not much remains of the shrine.  A headless granite statue of a man stands against the west wall.  Fragments of color suggest once-vibrant frescoes on the walls.
	* At the east a djed pillar still stands: 8’ tall and formed of concentric circles of stone.
		* The ghouls give it a wide berth, as it sparks constantly (a vestige of its old divine power). 

* Cinna Minux has stationed six ghouls here as a deterrent to visitors.
	* They have strict orders to send one to report any intruders to him.  Given their rapacious nature, 33% they actually obey.

6 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 16, 15, 15, 14, 14, 13; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

### 7-124: Shrine to Sobek

* Badly looted and desecrated by vandals over the centuries, this small shrine to the aggressive sea-god, Sobek, has lost any connection to the divine.
	* Bits of frescoes are still visible:
		* A crocodile-headed human with spears in each hand, riding a wave in a fragile-looking boat
		* The same crocodile-headed man spearing enemies
		* A crocodile head is emerging from a mound of sand or earth.
	* A dais to the south once held the cult statue, but it is gone.
	* Furnishings
		* 2 comfortable beds, a quartet of chairs.
		* A table filled with food, and a set of twelve bottles of wine. 
		* A pair of locked chests

			* Elliana’s chest (locked)
				* A sack (893 sp, 431 gp); 2 potions of heroism; a bolt of patterned yellow silk with elephants (250 gp); a pair of yellow silk slippers embroidered with silver thread (150 gp); a white gold ring of friendly defense (new).
					* The other ring is in one of the bestial varumani caves (see 7-96).

* Cinna Minux’s two charmed minions have made this chamber their home.
	* The pair were part of an adventuring party, defeated on the chasm floor.  Cinna came across these survivors and easily charmed them.
	* (75%) the pair are in 7-128 with Cinna; else they are here.

### 7-125: Shrine to Wadjet (Sekhmet)

* NOTE: Reflavor snakes to lions and Wadjet to Sekhmet.
	* Praying to the statue causes it to rake with a claw (same results).

* One of the largest rooms in the complex, this 15’-tall chamber holds a shrine to the protector goddess Wadjet (Sekhmet).
	* It is in good condition.  The north, west, and east walls are lined with impressive, 9’-tall, high relief carvings of hooded cobras rearing to strike. 
		* The heads of the cobras are about 2’ square and project away from the wall by the same distance, with striking realism.
		* 3 heads have been broken off; the other 15 are intact. 
	* Across the southeast and southwest walls runs an 5'-tall inscription (,Mithric): ‘The Goddess Protects those who pray without Fear.’
	* The 10’-tall cult statue of Wadjet is found to the south: a lithe young woman with the head of a cobra.
		* Her body is white marble; the cobra head is gold, lapis, and silver (7500 gp).  Taking the head inflicts a curse on the thief.
		* If a brave, bareheaded postulant stands before Wadjet and beseeches her by name for her protection, the cobra head of the statue whips forward and bites the postulant on the head (d4 damage, bestows Protection from Evil for 6 hours, once per month).

### 7-126: Pool of Imperial Fortitude

* In the center of this circular, domed chamber is a magic pool.
	* The walls were originally pale green, now dirty with long strips of hanging paint.
	* The pool is set flush into the floor.  A band of yellow tiles outlines it.
	* The liquid is clear and inviting.
		* It was known to the Archonteans as the Pool of Imperial Fortitude, used by commanders before they departed to more dangerous parts of the halls.
		* A good draught imparts remove fear (duration 10 hours) in the drinker.

### 7-127: Lair of the Lesser Vampires

These puppets would easily be worth 400 gp each. 
		* An armor rack with a suit of ceremonial gilded mail (450 gp, only AC 8).
		* A pair of illustrated 4’-tall blackware vases (850 gp each, very fragile).
			* 1) The story of Larel and the Farmer’s Daughter (books)

### 7-128: Court of Cinna Minux 

This grand hall was once an important shrine to Horus, but now it serves as the court for the vampire, Cinna Minux, and his minions.

The ceiling is 25’ tall. Two lines of columns march along the flanks of the chamber towards the cult statue at the western end. The walls are decorated with scenes of hawk-headed Horus presiding over the weather and over armies of Archontean soldiers. Two massive, oaken tables dominate the center of the chamber. They are piled with food, plates, silverware, and candelabra. Several continual light spells cast on the ceiling provide adequate light.Statue: Standing on a 3’ dais, the 15’-tall statue depicts a standing man holding spears in each hand (the butts rest against his feet). The head has been knocked off, however, and now serves as the centerpiece of Cinna Minux’s table.

Tables: Both tables are 20’ long and made of heavy oak. They are joined in a t-shape, such that Cinna and his greater minions can sit at the head table while the lesser minions (ogres and varumani) sit on the cross. Dotting the tables is an impressive array of objects: six heavy gold candelabra (200 gp each); three silver ewers (75 gp each); a dozen fine porcelain plates decorated with the imperial helmet (600 gp the set); a dozen sets of gold and steel ableware 
(100 gp each set); three fine porcelain vases filled with dried flowers (150 gp each); a dozen crystal goblets (75 gp each); eight pewter tankards (10 gp each); and seven heavy pewter serving dishes (25 gp each). The serving dishes are filled with food: dried fruit, dried meat, fresh meat (slightly rare), bread, jams, preserves, etc.. Seven bottles of imported Archontean wine (45 gp each) and a keg of Hak’s mushroom ale (see 7-94) complete the feast.

On the table in front of Cinna sits the hawk head of Horus. At its core the head is marble, with a covering of gold to represent his back feathers, and eyes formed from silver, yellow topaz and sapphire. Intact the head is worth 8,000 gp, but weighs 125 lb; if the head is broken up, the metals and gems are worth 1,500 gp.Unless previously alerted to intruders, and in some circumstances even then, Cinna Minux is found here, holding court with his 
minions. He occupies the central seat at the high table. To his left are Brenna and Joshuel; to his right are Nasteon and Elliana. Two ogres and two bestial varumani sit at the cross table. Cinna enjoys ceremony and the trappings of the civilized life, and likes nothing more than to read edifying verses or stories to his minions and to encourage them to offer songs to the group. 

If a party manages to reach this location without causing a general alert, or if a party has sought negotiations with the vampire, then Cinna greets the PCs as guests and invites them to his table. Should the PCs agree, they are free to eat and drink with the company without fear. At the end of the meal, Cinna politely invites guests to share stories, poetry or song. If the offerings are successful (as determined by the GM), Cinna likely allows the party to depart in peace, with a warning not to intrude again. If the PCs’ efforts are unsuccessful, or if they show hostility, then Cinna signals his minions to attack.

GM Note: Although they are not nourished by normal food, the three vampires do consume portions of the feast for the sake of appearances. When one of them brings back a victim, they dine on it in their personal lairs and dispose of the body in 7-132.

Cinna Minux, vampire: Cinna is dressed in black silk chased with silver thread, with a silver torc and a silver coronet. See stats at 7-122

Brenna Three-Braids, F7 and vampire (see stats at 7-127)

Joshuel the Binder, MU7 and vampire (see stats at 7-127)

### 7-129: Shrine to Jael (Khonsu)

* The shrine to Khonsu, the ancient Archontean god of the moon, secrecy and lawlessness is in good shape.
	* It is 20’ tall and painted matte black with glowing images of phases of the moon painted on the black.
		* Four images are extra-large: the new moon (north wall), waxing quarter (east wall), full moon (south wall), and waning quarter on the (west wall).
	* A 10’ circle of veined marble is inset into the granite floor in the center, with a 6'-tall bronze statue of a heron affixed to the marble.  It's beak is cracked open.
		* An inscription (Mithric) is chiseled into the marble encircling the statue: ‘Summon the Night Lord’s Cloak and Whisper Your Plan into his Fulsome Face.’
			* Speaking ‘Jael’ (Khonsu) while standing on the marble disk causes mist (i.e., Jael’s ‘cloak’) to billowing forth from the heron’s beak, filling the room in 5 rounds (harmless).
			* Once the room is mist-filled, one can seek blessings from Jael by whispering a secret plan or nefarious activity to the full moon image.
				* for d4 days: +1 all saves, +1 to all rolls while in moonlight

### 7-130: Sarcophagi and Wights

* This chamber has been fully stripped of any vestiges of its former purpose.
	* 3 simple stone sarcophagi stand in the center of the chamber, home to three wights that Cinna Minux has stationed here.
		* In sarcophagi: 231 ancient gold solidi; 497 ancient silver pennies; a gold coronet studded with chrysoberyls (6,000 gp); a silver medallion with an intaglio head of a forgotten archon of Arden Vul (900 gp); a necklace of alternating tubes of gold and silver (700 gp); a silver and lapis lazuli locket with a cameo in gold of Marius Tricotor (500 gp, 14,000 gp to a collector).
	* The southern door is stuck open.  (50%) combat here alerts the ogres in 7-119.
* The wights typically remain in their sarcophagi until aroused by sentient beings.
	* They do not pursue into the chasm (7-133).

3 wights: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 4+3; HP 33, 29, 27; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic needed to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### 7-131: Thothian Teleportation Ring

* A Thothian teleportation ring occupies this ell (YE-RE-GR-BL-BK-WH).
	* Cinna Minux owns a set of the glass activation squares and knows the ‘addresses’ to the rings at 3-33, 8-17, and 9-98, though he rarely visits for fear of betraying his location to the Sun-Scarred Knights.

### 7-132: Trapped Shrine to Isis

* This shrine is in extremely poor shape, its ceiling liable to collapse at any time.
	* The walls were once painted with bright frescoes, only a few splashes of color remain.
	* A dozen corpses in various states of decomposition have been tossed here, just inside the entrance.  All appear to have been drained of blood.
	* Three bowed wooden beams prop up the 14’ ceiling in the center of the chamber
		* They are obviously recent and look quite unstable.
	* At the south end of the chamber is a dais with a statue of a woman that glints gold.
		* Not the long-gone cult statue of Isis, but a poorly carved granite statue of a woman, painted gold and set here by Cinna Minux as a trap.
* (3-in-6) Passing the midpoint of the chamber to approach the statue causes a cave-in.
	* Collapse deals damage based on position in the room: within 0-10' of the door (2d6), 11-20’ (4d6); 21-30’ (6d6), 31-40’ (at the statue) (8d8).
	* A thief who successfully moves silently reduces this to 1-in-6.
	* A cave-in brings all inhabitants of Cinna’s domain on the run to confront intruders (see inhabitants of 7-119 to 7-132).

## Level 7: 133 - 148

### 7-133: Lesser Chasm

* This chasm is 70’ deep and bisects the former Archontean route from Level 7 to the main chasm floor (Level 9).
	* Several other connections to other levels meet here, at different elevations.
	* The floor of the chasm has much debris, some of it pieces of worked stone, lying in 2’ of murky water.
	* A pod of chasm cephalopods makes its home here.

5 medium chasm cephalopods (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 4; HP 28, 27, 26, 25, 24; #AT 5 (4 tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-4/1-4/1-6; MR 
25%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.

1 large chasm cephalopod (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’ flying (Class A); HD 6; HP 45; #AT 6 (five tentacles and a beak); Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6/1-8; MR 25%. Special 
attacks: surprise on 1-4; one tentacle drains spells from casters, adding 2-8 HP to chasm cephalopod per spell.

### 7-134: Cave

* A pair of adventurers slain by the chasm cephalopods lies in this cave.
	* The elven mage and human fighter have been largely stripped by scavengers.
		* Remaining: a single agate (10 gp) and scroll (monster summoning IV) wrapped around the mage's right calf, below his leggings.

### 7-135: Tunnel up to SL6-1b

* This tunnel snakes gently upward before joining the cavern of Pol (SL6-17 and SL6-18).
	* It is devoid of traffic.

### 7-136: Ancient Archontean Road to 9-101

* This broad, 15’-tall corridor was built by the Archonteans as a main military conduit between their administrative / religious sectors (Level 7 and SL7) and their outpost on the chasm floor (9-101).
	* It leads down to the area near Marius’s headquarters.
	* Cinna Minux (7-122) traverses this road to hunt on the chasm floor.
	* Because of the chasm (7-133), few others use this route.

### 7-137: Tunnel up to 5-100

* This tunnel departs the wall of the chasm (7-133) and snakes upward to 5-100.

### 7-138: Heqeti Corridor Fragment

* This fragment of corridor is pebbled or granulated, and somewhat oily.
	* It leads to a cave-in in the north.

### 7-139: Tomb of Kekulessa

* The stone door to this lost tomb is partly broken (open doors).
* Inside is the tomb of a heqeti hero from antiquity, Kekulessa.
	* The tomb is only 7’ tall, its walls the usual pebbled, oily heqeti affair.
	* From the south wall a stone carving of a gaping salamander maw projects.
	* In the center of the chamber is a simple, four-step, funeral ziggurat on top of which rest the bones of Kekulessa.
		* Scattered on the steps of the ziggurat are various objects of the deceased: three 4”-tall pyramids of solid copper (100 gp each), one 6” pyramid of solid silver (350 gp), a set of dividers, a pair of calipers, a dozen human scalps strung on a leather string, a necklace of heavy platinum rectangles (2,500 gp); and 3 tears of Kauket (new). 

* If non-heqeti enter the chamber, the outrage causes Kekulessa’s bones to animate.
	* He leaps forward as a heqeti old one (new), wielding his stone-tipped spear +2.
	* The salamander head on the south wall extends 3 ‘tongues’ of green energy to grab intruders (as 6th-level fighter, 1d4 and grab/pull; 4d6 under STR to escape, 2 rounds to fully pull into maw where they are help helpless).

Kekulessa, an heqeti old one (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 3; MV 90’; HD 6+6; HP 47,; #AT 1 Dmg 5-14 (spear +2). Special attacks: leap; cursed tongue. Special defenses: turned as spectres; half damage from piercing and edged weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold-based spells. Possessions: stone-tipped spear +2.

### 7-140: Shattered Constructs

This wide cave is relatively flat.
* 2 shattered rudishva constructs (stone natarajas) lie in pieces before the tunnel to 7-143.
	* Pieces: 2 torsos with heads, 4 legs, and 8 arms (2 w/ nothing, 2 w/ scimitars, 2 w/ small pots, 2 w/ drums).
	* One is still slightly animate; its eyes follow any non-rudishva, its grinning mouth grinds its stone teeth.  It is harmless.
* Careful listening at the southern tunnel catches the sounds of shouting and combat.

### 7-141: Tunnel Up to 5-85b

* This tunnel wends its way upwards some 800’ to 5-85B. 

### 7-142: Cave of the Dust Monster

* The cavern is covered with sand and dirt, littered with numerous bones and other debris.
	* A large dust monster (new) lies in wait, ready to feast on chasm cephalopods and whatever else it can find.

1 large dust monster (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 0; MV 90’; HD 8, HP 38; #AT 1; Dmg 3-16. Special attacks: suffocation; blinding. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from blunt magical weapons.

### 7-143: Engine Room of the Beacon

This large chamber constitutes one of the original modules of the starship Beacon, the engine room. This module contains some artifacts that are both valuable and potentially useful, even though it certainly cannot be used to drive a starship anymore.

The outer walls of the engine room are made of triple-strength plasteel, painted gunmetal grey on the outside and off-white on the inside. The module is 40’ tall, and has two main areas. The first is the engineering deck, set 20’ above the floor of the module. Both entrances to the module give forth onto the engineering deck. The second area is the 60’x40’x20’ drive well in the center of the module, in which the six warp drives stand. 

A fierce battle is currently raging between three factions: a rudishva animated construct; a party of Priscian explorers who navigated their way here from Level 9 via 7-136 and 7-138; and one of Kerbog Khan’s rare battle automatons (who arrived via 5-85B and 7-141). The construct is carrying out its last orders, to prevent non-rudishva from entering the module. The Priscians and the automaton are each in search of artifacts. Kerbog Khan (SL12-25) is currently directly controlling his automaton, and the strange voice of that wizard may be heard bellowing imprecations, shouting for blood samples, and threatening magical ruin on the Priscians. The Priscians are fighting quietly, using hand signals in addition to spells. Two Priscian conversi are already dead. Either the Priscians or Kerbog Khan would be willing to ally with a party of PCs, but only if the PCs help eliminate the other group.

Engineering Deck: Two control consoles stand at either end of this deck. The consoles are 4’ from the ground and appear as black glass sheets studded with dials and buttons. Without technical training it would be impossible to figure out what all the functions are, let alone how to operate or trouble-shoot the drives. Those who simply push buttons and crank dials at random have a 5% chance per round of causing a meltdown in one of the drives. Once begun, a meltdown leads to loud klaxon horns and flashing red lights. In 4 rounds one of the drives will explode for 30d6 damage to all in the area. A meltdown can be averted by pushing the right sequence of buttons (1% chance if attempted randomly). With proper instructions (see below), the consoles can also be used to unlock the panels holding the drive rods.

Warp Drive Well:  The well is accessed by four plasteel ladders set into the sides of the well. The drives appear as 10’-diameter, 30’-tall columns of clear plasteel filled with glowing yellow gel. A maze of tubing, wires, glowing panels, and dials is attached to the outside of each drive. At the foot of each drive is an openable panel, some 18”x36” in size. The panels can only be opened using the consoles on the engineering deck. Doing so reveals a heavy (50 lb), 2’-long rod of clear plasteel filled with glowing orange liquid; this rod is a ‘drive rod.’ 

The six engines are also connected to each other, as well as to consoles to the east and west, by a set of blue plasteel tubing. Although amber lights periodically blink on each of the drives, all six engines have been in ‘power-down’ state for millennia; a nuclear generator under the engineering deck continues to provide the power that keeps the drives active.

 Two rudishva skeletons (inert) lie on the floor of the drive well. One carries a GnuCoder 1000 with one data crystal and a full lesser power supply (see new technological items). The data crystal carries a set of orders that include instructions on how to remove two of the drive cores safely, and instructions (in Rudishva) to “report immediately to Lieutenant Svar-Loj in the shuttle bay” (i.e., SL13-37). One who reads Rudishva could use these instructions at 
the control console to open the panel doors on any or all of engines so as to remove the drive rods.

		* A 5’-diameter silvery inset in the floor, with a 10”x10” square affixed to the wall.
		* A rune is etched into the silvery material.
		* To activate, one stands on the circle and touches the square. 
	* T11 (access to 5-95)

### 7-145: Pool of Sparkling Liquid

* A softly gurgling basin of black granite (15' diamater, 3' deep), filled with opalescent, sparkly liquid, is dwarfed by the large, empty chamber surrounding it.
	* Anything coated in the liquid will levitate in the shaft (7-146). The coating lasts for an hour, but can, strangely enough, be brushed off easily. 

### 7-146: Rudishva Transit Shaft

* A 40’-square shaft, sheathed in white marble and silver grout, extends 1,100’ through the Halls, commencing at 5-84 and culminating at 9-91 (the floor is 300' below).
	* Built by the rudishva as a swift form of transport for their officers.
	* Anything or anyone coated in the opalescent liquid levitates in the pit (20' / round).
	* Removing even 10% of the silver grout cancels the levitation effect.
	* From this point one can access 5-84, 6-164, and 9-91.
* 2 giant rudishva skeletons sit in gargantuan stone chairs overlooking the transit shaft.
	* They animate and confront any non-rudishva stepping out of the shaft onto the floor of the chamber.

### 7-147: Dangerous Route to Chasm Floor (9-86)

	* Hand- and foot-holds, and cracks allow a daring few to traverse the lower chasm outside the scrutiny of the thegn.
	* This route is dangerous; roll 3d8 under DEX (2d8 for thieves) every 100’ or fall.

### 7-148: Tunnel to the Flooded Vaults, SL7-9a

* A 4’-diameter hole in the chasm wall leads to a narrow tunnel that wends its way to the Flooded Vaults region (SL9-7a).
	* The hole is 50’ above the descending route that the bestial varumani take to the chasm floor (see 7-147).
