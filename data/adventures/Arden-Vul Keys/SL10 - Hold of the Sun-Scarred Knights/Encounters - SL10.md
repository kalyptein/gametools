3. The Sanctum (SL10A-16 to SL10A-24)
The Sanctum is a busy place, with knights and varlets moving 
about fairly frequently. Checks should be made every turn, with a 
1 in 6 chance for an encounter. If an encounter is indicated, it will 
involve the inhabitants of the nearest chamber. If those inhabitants 
discover intruders, they will raise the alarm instantly, bringing all 
other inhabitants of the Sanctum within 1-3 rounds, and eventually 
the knights and varlets from the Citadel within 7-10 rounds.



10b

The inhabitants move throughout the Citadel regularly. For every 3 
turns the PCs are undetected in the Citadel (if that is even possible), 
there is a 1 in 4 chance for an encounter. The encounter will be 
the residents of the nearest occupied chamber (50%), or one of the 
knights or varlets currently found in the Sanctum (50%). For the 
latter, the GM should choose the current occupants of SL10A-16 
to SL10A-24. With any encounter, those discovering the PCs will 
attempt to raise the alarm before engaging in combat.
