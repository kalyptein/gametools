## Overview

### Sub-Level 10A: Hold of the Sun-Scarred Knights

This area comprises one half of the domain of the powerful sept of warriors known as the Sun-Scarred Knights (the other half - the Citadel - is found at Sub-Level 10B). This portion of their domain includes the huge cavern in which their citadel (SL10A-14) rests, along with surrounding caves and worked halls. Although the citadel is the most potent and defensible portion of the domain, the worked chambers north of the citadel, known as the Sanctum, are an essential component of the knights’ domain. Among those worked areas may be found the cloister of the knights (SL10A-17), their smithy (SL10A-19), the Solar Chapel (SL10A-24), and the private chambers of Master Malachite, leader of the sept (SL10A-32, SL10A-33). Almost all of the infrequent visitors to the domain approach the Hold from the south, via the Entrance Hall (SL10A-2); from there, if they dare, they may approach the citadel across the treacherous sword bridges (SL10A-11). Of course, those with the capacity for flight may skip the bridges to arrive at the front door to the citadel (SL10A-13) or could even bypass the citadel and fly directly to SL10A-15. 

Visitors who reach the entrance gate to the citadel (SL10A-13) and attempt negotiation are typically met with silence. If the knights have invited visitors (a rare occurrence), they will be met outside the citadel, in area SL10A-2. In no case are visitors invited within the Citadel. If visitors to the Citadel appear hostile, they are met by missile fire and magic from the defenders (see SL10B introduction for details). If visitors bypass the Citadel and attempt 
instead to penetrate the inner sanctum (e.g. SL10A-16), they must first deal with the iron doors there, and then the guardian, Ranke. Unless they are exceptionally stealthy and quiet, the noise of combat at SL10A-16 brings all inhabitants of the Sanctum at a run to area SL10A-17 to defend the area; the knights in the Citadel will mount a counter attack across the bridge (SL10A-15) and try to catch intruders in the rear flank. Even the Master is likely (66%) to join in defense of the Sanctum.

Not all of the fourteen knights and fifteen varlets who comprise the rder are present in the domain at any given time; indeed, half are usually absent, performing missions for the master or for themselves. As a result, assaults on any portion of the domain are usually met by a force that includes 7-8 knights, 7-8 varlets, Ricchar Wither-Hand, Jolene the apprentice, and possibly the Master himself (33%).

In the present, the order is composed of fourteen knights plus the Master. All matters of importance are debated in regular meetings known as Convocation, and decisions are made through a ritual vote. Despite the collective ethos of the order, it is also clear that Master Malachite (aka Melok-Ri) is the first among equals. His opinions are typically accorded greater weight, and his approval or disapproval of a course of action is enough to be decisive. Junior members of the order are known as varlets and are assigned to the service of a specific knight. Given his age and unusual combination of cultural and genetic impulses, Melok-Ri has become less engaged in the day-to-day operations of the order; he prefers to ruminate on the past and plan long-term strategy from the comfort of his sanctum. The senior knight, Sir Ennius, therefore exercises quite a bit of influence in Malachite’s absence. 
The order has also traditionally recruited a young magic user to serve as the order’s expert in magical affairs (and creator of magical items); this wizard is also allowed to take an apprentice. The only other living creatures allowed within the citadel are a pair of cooks, usually taken from the goblin clans.

Upon joining the order, each knight takes a new name and swears to abandon his/her previous identity. The name may honor some previous knight or impressive ancient hero (e.g., Sir Ennius, Sir Larel, etc.), it may represent an allegorical quality (e.g., Sir Sorrow, Sir Spes, Sir Discord), or it may be cryptic (e.g., Sir Sixth, Sir Vambrace, or Sir Calculor). The communities of Arden Vul assume that a knight keeps his/her name for his/her lifetime, but there is no way to be sure that knights do not change their names as it suits them. Although many attempts have been made to explain the choice of a knight’s name by the character of his/her actions, this has always proven fruitless, for knights do not consistently practice heroism or asceticism, nor do they insist on particular behavior in others.

Significant Regions of Sub-Level 10A

The Great Cavern and Entrance Halls
* SL10A1 to SL10A-13, SL10A-15
* Most of the time this region is notably empty of sentient creatures. The entrance halls (SL10A-1 to SL10A-6) are typically empty, except for the rare occasions on which a postulant for the varletry is undergoing the Tests. The great cavern (SL10A-7) is filled with mushrooms, and is home to insects, bats, and a band of achaierai. An unusual and clearly-evident feature of the region is the shaft of pure sunlight that streams from a hole in the roof to bathe area SL10A-12 in sunlight.
* Factions
	* The region is dominated by the Sun-Scarred Knights.
* Construction:
	* The worked halls are the product of the early generations of Archontean Knights; as a result the architecture is basically Archontean.
* Environment
	* The cavern is warm and humid. The entrance halls are cooler and drier.

The Sanctum of the Knights
* SL10A-16 to SL10A-34
* The northern, worked chambers of the sub-level form the Sanctum of the knights, where several of their most important social and recreational facilities are located. The Sanctum is guarded by a pair of iron doors and an ancient rudishva military-grade security construct, Ranke (SL10A-16). Within is the cloister of the knights (SL10A-17), the smithy (SL10A-19), the library (SL10A-22), the solar chapel (SL10A-24), and more. Those knights who are not out on a mission can be found here, or in the citadel itself (SL10A-14).
* Factions
	* The region is fully controlled by the Sun-Scarred Knights.
* Construction
	* The worked areas are Archontean in origin, with the exception of areas SL10A-30 to SL10A-33, which are rudishva.
* Environment
	* The Sanctum is cool and dry.

Access and Egress
* To Level 8: stairs at SL10A-1, leading down to 8-56
* To Level 8: tunnel at SL10A-9, leading down to 8-82
* To Level 9: tunnel at SL10A-8, leading down to 9-99A
* To Sub-Level 10B: door to the Citadel at SL10A-13, leading to SL10B-1
* To Sub-Level 10B: portcullis at SL10A-15, leading to SL10B-24

### Sub-Level 10B: Citadel of the Sun-Scarred Knights

This area defines one half of the domain of the powerful sept of warriors known as the Sun-Scarred Knights (the other half - the Hold - is found at Sub-Level 10A). The Citadel is comprised of seven floors of chambers hollowed out of the 150’-tall pillar (SL10A-14) that stands in the great cavern (SL10A-7). The Citadel was the original home of the Sun-Scarred Knights, before they delved the extra chambers known as the Sanctum (SL10A-16 to SL10A-34). It remains the residence for the knights and varlets, even if many of the knights prefer the greater comfort of the Sanctum for their leisure time. The Citadel is also home to the 
Chapter House (SL10B-30), where the entire Order meets to consider its collective business. 

The exterior walls of the citadel are 10’ thick, and are punctured only in a few places:
* The southern entrance (SL10B-1; see also SL10A-13), which is 40’ from the cavern floor and obtained by the bridge from SL10A-12; 
* A series of arrow slits cut into the outer wall, also at a height of 40-50’ from the cavern floor; 
* The northern entrance (SL10B-24), at a height 80’ above the floor and connected to the bridge at SL10A-15; 
* A pair of arrow slits on the north wall, also at a height of 80’ from the cavern floor.
* A pair of 1”-diameter holes in the north wall, leading to SL10B-30. These are used by Master Malachite when he travels by gaseous form from SL10A-32 to lead the infrequent sessions of the Chapter of the Knights.

If visitors to the Citadel appear hostile, they are met by missile fire and magic from the defenders (see SL10B introduction for details). All knights currently in the Citadel rally either to the 3rd floor (SL10B-2), 5th floor (SL10B-23 and SL10B-25), or 6th floor (SL10B-28) of the citadel to repel invaders. They are joined by Ricchar Wither-Hand and his apprentice, Jolene (see SL10B-26), who use their magic in defense of the citadel. If possible, the knights and varlets currently found in the inner sanctum (SL10A-16 to SL10A-26) will rush across the bridge (SL10A-15) to join the defense. Master Malachite (SL10A-32) is unlikely (33%) to join the defense of the citadel.

For information about the Order of Sun-Scarred Knights, including their number, organization, and leadership, see the introduction to Sub-level 10A.

## Sub-Level 10A: Hold of the Sun-Scarred Knights
### Sub-Level 10A: 1 - 15

#### SL10A-1: Grand Stairs Down to 8-56

* These 20’-wide stairs descend through several landings and changes of direction before debouching at 8-56.

#### SL10A-2: Entrance Hall

* This broad hall is 25’ tall and supported by two rows of 5’-diameter pillars.
	* To the north a ledge overlooks the great cavern (SL10A-7) 70’ above the cavern floor.
	* The hall is unlit, but the bright light from SL10A-12 is apparent everywhere.
	* The east and west walls are covered with impressive mosaics of figures in the gothic-style armor of the sun-scarred knights (15 on each side).
		* Each knight’s equipment is broadly similar, but each is posed slightly different pose, as if demonstrating a form of weapon training.

#### SL10A-3: Empty Meeting Hall

* A 15’-long, heavy stone table occupies the center of this undecorated room.
	* 16 cylindrical stone ‘stools’ surround it.
	* A sunburst motif is engraved in the center of the table.
* The Sun-Scarred Knights use this chamber on the extremely rare occasions they agree to meet with those not of their sept.
	* Three knights, with varlets, form the negotiating party; they discuss matters here, but do not invite visitors within the Citadel.

#### SL10A-4: Postulants’ Hall

* A blazing sunrise image in orange paint covers the east wall of this chamber.
	* Standing near the sunburst image are 3 battered, pine bunkbeds, with rough horse-hair mattresses.
	* On either side of the door is a set of heavy shackles for hands and feet, set firmly into the stone of the walls.
		* 25% chance an unfortunate is languishing in the shackles.
			* If so, it is Lellagalon Begelsson, an elven adventurer.

* GM Note: The knights use this chamber to house postulants whom they hope might pass the tests and become varlets.
	* Failed postulants are shackled, and eventually thrown into the great cavern.
	* Lellagalon Begelsson was thought to be good material for a varlet, as the knights are fascinated by elves and would like to bring more of them into the sept.
	* Lellagalon’s morality proved incompatibility with that of the knights, however, and they have shackled him here to await Master Malachite’s (SL10A-32) decision about what to do with him.

Lellagalon Begelsson, 5th-level male elf fighter: SZ M; AL CG; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 5; HP 37; #AT 1; Dmg by weapon. Abilities: STR 14, INT 16, WIS 10, DEX 15, CON 11, CHA 16. Possessions: splint mail; purse with six large gold coins (10 gp each); a carved oak ring.

#### SL10A-5: Test of Justice

* This hall is one of the pair of testing chambers in which postulants to the sept of Sun-Scarred Knights undergo basic personality tests.
	* Most of the tests are oral and customary, but the hall also has a fixed, quasi-ceremonial test that postulants must pass. 
* The floor of this 15’-tall hall is one enormous mosaic, depicting scenes of judging, justice, and execution.
	* A double row of columns surrounds a 10’ white marble statue facing the east wall.
		* It depicts a sun-scarred knight, with gothic armor and circlet of command, sitting in a chair holding a huge broadsword horizontally on his lap.
		* At his feet is a 3'-wide marble bowl containing three spheres of highly polished red porphyry, each 1" in diameter.
		* The plinth reads: “A knight must dispense justice.”
	* Against the north wall are three stations, each a 10’ x 3’ x 4’ stone block with a 6’-tall high relief sculpture, and below the inscription (Mithric) “Is this Justice?” and a semi-circular indentation 1’ in diameter.
			* First Station: the sculpture shows a knight averting his eyes as the starving girl and her child eat an obviously stolen loaf of bread. The gaol is empty, and the baker, who is clamoring in the background, is ignored. 
			* Second Station: the sculpture shows a knight closing a gaol door upon the mother and child while handing a loaf of bread to the baker; the baker smiles in satisfaction.
			* Third Station: the sculpture shows a knight closing the gaol door upon the mother, while delivering a chained and downcast child and the loaf of bread into the hands of the baker, who is rubbing his hands with pleasure.

The Test of Justice
* The test is activated by removing one of the porphyry orbs from the bowl.
* The statue loudly intones (Archontean, Thorcin, Goblin, Elvish, Dwarvish)
	* “A knight must dispense justice. Consider the following, and make your choice. The young mother had no other family, and she and her child were starving. Despite knowing the law, she stole bread from the local baker. What should be her fate?”
* One places a red porphyry stone in the receptacle of the station matching their answer.
	* The correct answer for the Sun-Scarred Knights is the middle choice (jailing the mother and child for their crime).
	* The first station does not represent justice, in the Lawful Neutral eyes of the Order, because the baker has been wronged.
	* The third station, in which the baker is rewarded with the child as apprentice/slave, is also not justice as it reflects excessive punishment.
* Passing the Test of Justice causes the eastern Sword Bridge (SL10A-11) to rotate 90-degrees for six turns, allowing passage to the Sun Rock (SL10A-12).
	* Choosing the wrong option causes the magic mouth to intone: “You fail to understand justice. Depart!” The test becomes unavailable for three days.

#### SL10A-6: Test of Fidelity

This hall is one of the pair of testing chambers in which postulants to the sept of Sun-Scarred Knights are inspected for their moral and personality suitability for the varletry.
	* Most of the tests are oral and customary, but the hall also has a fixed, quasi-ceremonial test that postulants must pass. 
* The floor of this 15’-tall hall is one enormous mosaic, depicting scenes of loyalty.
	* A double row of columns surrounds a 10’ white marble statue facing the west wall.
		* It depicts a sun-scarred knight, with gothic armor and circlet of command, kneeling before a standing cloaked figure.  The cloaked figure clasps his hands around the palms of the knight, who gazes up into the figure’s face.
		* At his feet is a 3'-wide marble bowl containing three spheres of highly polished black porphyry, each 1" in diameter.
		* The plinth reads: “A knight must remain faithful.”
	* Against the north wall are three stations, each a 10’ x 3’ x 4’ stone block with a 6’-tall high relief sculpture, and below the inscription (Mithric) “Is this Fidelity?” and a semi-circular indentation 1" in diameter.
		* First Station: two merchants of equal stature stand together before a circle of Factor leaders. The two present a large bag of coins to the circle as one.
		* Second Station: one merchant delivers a large bag of coins to a circle of factor leaders. The other merchant sits in the gutter outside the factor hall, tearing his hair out. 
		* Third Station: on the left, one merchant presents a small bag of coins to the second, who is begging for aid. On the right, the pair then appear before the circle of factor leaders; one stands tall and presents a large bag of coins, while the other kneels and presents a small bag of coins.

The Test of Fidelity
* The test is activated by removing one of the porphyry orbs from the bowl.
* The statue loudly intones (Archontean, Thorcin, Goblin, Elvish, Dwarvish)
	* “A knight must be faithful. Consider the following, and make your choice. Two merchants in the same factor journey together to a city. One is successful in trading, the other is not. How does the successful merchant act when they return home?”
* One places a black porphyry stone in the receptacle of the station matching their answer.
	* The correct answer for the Sun-Scarred Knights is the first station, in which the solidarity of the group is affirmed when the successful merchant supports the unsuccessful one before their peers.
* Passing the Test of Fidelity causes the western Sword Bridge (SL10A-11) to rotate 90-degrees for six turns, allowing passage to the Sun Rock (SL10A-12).
	* Choosing the wrong option causes the magic mouth to intone: “You fail to understand fidelity. Depart!” The test becomes unavailable for three days.

#### SL10A-7: Great Cavern

* This huge cavern is 150’ tall, and partially lit from the sunbeam in SL10A-12. 
	* A massive rock pillar ithe center (SL10A-14) rises from floor to ceiling; partly hollowed out to provide the citadel of the knights. 
	* A lesser rock formation rises only 40’ from the floor (SL10A-12), bathed in sunlight from a hole in the ceiling of the cavern.
	* The walls of the cavern are cloaked in creepers, vines, mosses and lichens.
		* The floor is a mushroom forest, with specimens of aqua vitae, cloud cap, eye-opener, orange lamp, and white rib mushrooms (flora), filled with insects and small rodents.
		* A flock of achaierai inhabit the forest floor, hunting in packs of 1d3+1.
			* The knights tolerate the presence of the foul birds because they keep out other large predators.
			* Failed postulants (SL10A-4) thrown into the cavern are eagerly hunted by the flock.
			* Due to their familiarity with the forest and sharp sense of smell, the achaierai surprise on 3-in-6.
			* They like to drive victims into ambushes by others in the flock.
		* Tromping around in the mushroom forest is mostly unrewarding.
			* Knocking down the fungi and poking into the muck for 6 Turns finds an item of interest (only once each).

D10 Item GM Note
* 1) a 6” gold plaque incised with an Archon’s head. On the reverse is the legend: “Mercurion the Archon, AEP 1326”  (325 gp)
* 2) a set of interlocking silver bangle bracelets (35 gp)
* 3) a pair of ivory spheres shaped and painted as eyes, with lapis lazuli eyballs (275 gp)
* 4) a lost solar ring from a sun-scarred knight (new)
	* If this potent item is displayed in the presence of a Sun-Scarred Knight, they demand its immediate return.
* 5) An ivory scroll case (75 gp), containing a formal letter from Archon Alcibiades the Hunter (500 gp as a historical artifact).
	* “To the self-proclaimed master of knights, Malachite, from Alcibiades, archon of the great city. You are required to appear in the palace at the first of the month. Bring your knights for defense of the city. Failure to comply will be treated as treason. (dated) 1750 AEP.”
* 6) an unused rudishva lesserpower supply (tech)
* 7) A fine silver mesh bag (45 gp), with three marbles and a tightly folded parchment note
	* “Dearest Drusion, Please abandon your folly, and return to your family! The knights are neither honorable nor right for you. I don’t want to lose you! [signed] Babalwa.”
	* GM Note: suggests the familial trauma wrought by a decision to join the Knights.
* 8) a pearl necklace of invisibility (new), with 3 pearls remaining.
* 9) a piece of basalt (2’ tall, 18” in diameter) carved to depict 2 warriors embracing (100 gp)
* 10) a piece of broken crockery, on the inside of which is scrawled a note.
	* “Mother – it was a great mistake. The master has done things, things I do not like. I may never be the same. Your dearest Drusion”
	* GM Note: a hint about the scarification ceremony (SL10A-28)

10 achaierai: SZ L; AL CE; AC body 8, legs -1; HD 9 (beak) or 4 (claws); HP 40 (body), 15(x4) (legs); #AT 3; Dmg 1-8/1-8/1-10; MR 35%. Special defenses: toxic smoke; regenerate damage to legs in 2 days.

#### SL10A-8: Tunnel down to 9-99a

* This 5’-wide passage winds downward, with occasional steps hewn out of the rock, until it reaches the edge of the great cavern (9-99a).

#### SL10A-9: Tunnel down to 8-82

* This tunnel corkscrews downward before ending up at 8-82.

#### SL10A-10: Side Cave

* This side cave is easy to overlook amid the mushroom forest of the cavern floor. 
	* Within is the decomposing corpse of an adolescent male human in a tattered white shift.
		* A gold ring with an intaglioed sardonyx stone hangs from a cord around his neck (75 gp).  
			* The carving shows a dolphin, and the name “Drusion Krakteros” is etched on the inside of the band (2500 gp from the Krakteros clan).

GM Note: this is the body of Drusion, a postulant for admission to the Order of Sun-Scarred Knights.  He was recruited to the Sun-Scarred Knights but couldn’t tolerate the discipline.  He fled after a beating and died here.  For hints about his fate, see the table in SL10A-7.

#### SL10A-11: Sword Bridges 

* The base state for the two bridges to SL10A-12 is a triangular solid made of plasteel, 5' on a side, slightly concave, with the razor-sharp point of the triangle facing upward.
	* Both bridges descend at a 30-degree slope, making the sharp point of each bridge difficult to traverse (hence the name ‘sword bridges’). 
	* An attempt to shimmy down a bridge on hands and knees requires 2 rolls of 5d6 under DEX (each still inflicts 2d4 damage).
	* Falling from the bridge inflicts 3d6 and likely attracts the achaierai (see SL10A-7).
	* Passing each of the moral tests (SL10A-5, SL10A-6) causes one of the bridges to rotate with a low grinding noise, presenting one of the flat, 5'-wide faces towards the top.  The bridge stays flat for 6 turns before reverting to its base position.

#### SL10A-12: Sun Rock and Pear Tree

* This rock rises 40’ above the floor of the great cavern. It is brightly lit with a shaft of sunlight.
	* In the exact center of the rock is a 10’ diameter stone ring rising 6’ above the floor of the rock, with a beautiful pear tree laden with fruit growing in it.
		* The tree is carefully pruned by the knights and presents a perfect canopy over the rock. The pears are juicy and delicious.
		* The stone ring is filled with rich loam, fertilized by subterranean fungi and nutrients, and extends 20’ down into the center of the rock, allowing the pear tree to take firm root.
	* The light shining down is real sunlight passed through a series of light shafts lined with polished plasglass panels.

#### SL10A-13: Bridge, Ledge and Front Door

* A slim (5’-wide) stone bridge connects the Sun Rock (SL10A-12) to an outcropping protruding 5’ beyond the southern wall of the citadel (SL10A-14).
	* The outcropping is only 2’ thick.
	* Four 6’-tall iron torch-holders are stuck into holes in it. 
* The door to the Citadel is a massive piece of oak, bound with iron and studded with large rivets. 
	* A large knocker in the door's center, its boss appears as a horned demonic head.
	* The door is barred on the inside by two impressive beams. 
	* A hollow horn from a narwhal-like creature protrudes from the wall next to the door, presenting a 2”-diameter hole that extends inward to SL10B-2.
		* This allows easy communication with supplicants on the ledge.  It also allows Master Malachite to travel through the wall in gaseous form.
	* For entrance into the Citadel, see SL10B-1.

#### SL10A-14: Massive Pillar Containing the Citadel of the Knights

* A massive rock pillar, 90’ on a side, rises 150’ from the floor of the cavern to its ceiling.
	* Lights glow from holes in the pillar 45’ up from the floor (c.f. SL10B-2).
	* The exterior wall has been flattened and shaped by stone masons.
		* In addition to its fairly straight lines, the exterior is carved with scores of monstrous faces of varying size, depth, and monstrousness, combining to present an intimidating view to those looking at the citadel.
	* The interior of the pillar has been hollowed out into seven floors of chambers, the citadel of the Sun-Scarred Knights (SL10B).

#### SL10A-15: Stone Bridge

* This stone bridge soars 80’ above the floor of the cavern, connecting the northern entrance to the citadel (SL10B-24) with the Sanctum of the sept (SL10A-16 to SL10A-34).
	* The bridge is 8’ wide, 2’ thick, and lacks guard rails.
	* Access to the Citadel (SL10A-14) is blocked by a heavy iron portcullis that slots into holes in the bridge.
		* The lever to raise the portcullis is within the Citadel, in the hallway from SL10B-24 to SL10B-3.
		* The door leading into SL10A-16 is solid iron (locked).
			* Each of the knights has a key.
			* The door can be bypassed in gaseous form via two 6”-diameter holes lead from SL10A-16 into the great cavern (SL10A-7).  Master Malachite (SL10A-32) uses them to travel from the Sanctum to the Citadel.

### Sub-Level 10A: 16 - 34

#### SL10A-16: Entrance to the Sanctum

* This dark hall is sheathed in rudishva-style octagonal slabs of black marble. 
	* Unlike true rudishva construction, the hall and Sanctum contain right angles.
	* A double row of red porphyry columns leads towards the cloister (SL9-17)
	* Two niches are found part-way up the hall.
		* Each has a silvered-metal floor and a square plate of silvered metal on the wall; a socket allows technological items to be ‘plugged into’ the wall. 
			* The eastern niche is empty.
			* The western niche holds an active rudishva military-grade security construct named Ranke (new). 
* Ranke maintains a resting state until anyone passes her post.
	* She instantly attacks those who fail to clearly state the password (“Sunshine”).
	* Though well-preserved and still lethal, she has lost a few of her original functions.
	* If neutralized, Kerbog Khan might be able to restore her to full functionality (see SL12-28).
* The sounds of combat in the entry hall brings those in SL10A-18 and SL10A-22 to investigate within 2 rounds.

Ranke, rudishva military-grade security construct: SZ M; AL N; AC 0, MV 120’; HD 10; HP 50; #AT 2; Dmg 2-12/2-12 (monofilament blades) or 3-8/3-8 (fists); MR 50%. Special Attacks: plasma ray. Special Defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; leap unerringly 30’; regeneration 2 HP/round. Note: Ranke is no longer able to attack with fire gouts, nor can she project holographic images. Her armored-alloy torso is charged with electricity; any who touch her suffer 2-8 HP electric damage. Her armored torso and blades are only effective so long as they are powered; a full charge will keep them powered for 28 + d3 hours. Should she be unable to recharge, she loses her powered functions (monofilament blades, plasma, electric charge), her AC drops to 3, and she must attack by fists for 3-8/3-8 damage.

#### SL10A-17: Cloister

* The 40’-tall cloister of the knights presents a stark contrast in light and dark.
	* The center of the cloister is brightly lit with natural sunlight, while the surrounding ambulatory is dark and formed of octagonal pieces of black marble.
		* The center (the cloister proper), contains a burbling fountain and a riot of lush greenery.  The plant life thrives due to the sunlight streaming down from 3 light shafts cut in the ceiling.
		* A winding path of white stones wends among three cherry trees, four dogwoods, eight blueberry bushes, several planted herbs, and a dozen varieties of annual flowers.
	* The north wall is dominated by three enormous 15’ ebony doors (see SL10A-26).

#### SL10A-18: Training Hall

* Carved out of the naked granite, this large hall features a sand floor and bright magical light from a half-dozen continual lights attached to the walls. 
	* Along the north wall are various racks for martial training equipment.
		* Four suits of man-sized leather armor, jo- and bo-sticks, a rack of spears, 3 two-handed swords, 6 broad swords, and 1d6 other miscellaneous weapons.
	* A decrepit rudishva security construct (varumani tactical advisor, new) presides over the training hall. 
		* It is affectionately called Stink by the knights and varlets, for the sharp odor emitted by his slightly rancid biological components.
		* Stink knows three dozen training routines, with or without weapons, and is one reason for the knights’ formidable combat prowess. 
		* Stink aids any knight or varlet who calls for his assistance in combat (e.g. in a general melée at SL10A-16), but he is not inherently hostile to non-knights. 
		* If encountered without knights or varlets, he offers to ‘pump up’ the skills of any looking warriors, and can serve as a trainer for fighters up to 10th level.
	* Currently one knight and two varlets are training with Stink.

	* Here the smith, Astrid the Strong, and her assistant, Georgios, produce the high-quality steel items used by the knights.
* The hot forge occupies the ell to the west of the chamber, with a venting shaft leading to an unmapped series of small caves above.
	* An impressive affair, with three bellows and several layers of steel grill on which metal can be heated and shaped.
	* A small fire elemental has been bound to the forge for centuries, providing heat.
* The center of the chamber holds 3 anvils, 2 basins with water, 3 racks with high-quality smithing tools, and molds for the knights’ accoutrements (armor, swords, lances, etc.).

	* She is a 51-year old Wiskin, with rippling muscles, prematurely grey hair, and an endless store of bad jokes. 
* Georgios
	* Georgios was purchased from the Guild of Service (4-2) as a boy explicitly to become Astrid’s apprentice.
	* He is 17 years old, with dark black hair and a depressive demeanor.
* While both are subject to regular suggestions from Master Malachite, they are essentially content with their life.

#### SL10A-20: Tech Graveyard

* This 15’-tall chamber is crammed with broken and useless pieces of rudishva technology.
	* A narrow path threads through the stacked boxes and broken housings.
	* Alongside generic consoles, view screens, power couplings and other items:
		* A security encoder, a portable medical unit, a portable point defense controller, 3 point defense arrays, a Nutri-vore 2000 food dispenser, a jet-ski, a hover sled, 2 GnuCoder 3000 data recorders, a CompositScan 3000 mineral detector, a biohazard suit, and an aquafactor (tech).
			* All these items are non-functional.
			* One with significant experience with rudishva technology and INT 16+ might be able to repair a given piece of equipment, likely cannibalizing  other pieces here, with only a 25% chance of success.
	* Hidden under the piles of junk is a functional troll chest keyed to Master Malachite.
		* A kaliyani blasting rod, 2 biometric protection cards, and a battle helmet (tech).
		* It takes 5-8 turns of searching to locate the chest.
	* Scattered through the room are the disassembled pieces of a military-grade security construct, once known as Dronke.
		* She ceased functioning over a millennium ago and many of her electronic systems were repurposed to repair other equipment.
		* Master Malachite and the knights know of no way to rebuild her.  Kerbog Khan might be able to do so: see SL12-28 for details.
	* Hidden in the southwest corner, behind a set of dangling power cords, is a love nest used by varlets and the occasional knight.
		* It contains two thick candles, some blankets and pillows, and two bottles of rudishva aquavit (av items).
		* Both the Master and Sir Ennius are aware of the love nest, but tolerate it for purposes of morale.

#### SL10A-21: Solar

* This well-appointed chamber allows the residents of the citadel to relax in comfort.
	* It is sheathed in octagonal slabs of black marble.  The floor is covered with four large Archontean carpets (200 gp each).
	* Three leather sofas, six leather chairs, five side tables, three coffee tables, and three tripods of heating (new) complete the furnishings.
	* A wine rack holds 20 bottles of rudishva aquavit (av items).
	* The southeast corner holds a Nutri-vore 2500 food dispenser (tech).
		* The citadel's kitchen (SL10B-5) provides food, so they currently just use the Nutri-vore to synthesize rudishva aquavit.
	* Secret Door (north): hard to find (1 in 8), it is simply a regular 3’ octagonal panel of black marble hinged on the reverse (pulls into the room).
		* The aperture leading to SL10A-25 is only 3’ square.

* There is a chance that one or two knights are currently relaxing in the solar.

	* A pair of floor-standing globes, copper with colored glass tiles, stand at either end of the column of tables.
		* One depicts Magae (the world of Archontos)
			* It is based on a rudishva orbital scan (taken from the shuttle early on), and has details and precision beyond imperials maps, including parts of the world with which the empire is unfamiliar (10,000 gp to the empire).
			* The other globe depicts the rudishva homeworld.
	* Ten wooden bookshelves stand against the flat sections of the walls.
		* The library stacks are filled with hundreds of volumes that the knights either appropriated, copied, or were gifted over the centuries.
		* Includes copies of every work listed in the Arden Vul books appendix (except those that are autograph originals, e.g. Kel Bormol’s Chess Diary) and many others at the GM’s discretion.

Sir Larel, the Sun-Scarred Knight, 13th-level male Thorcin fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC -2; MV 120’; HD 13; HP 103; #AT 2/1; Dmg 8-14 (broadsword +3), 6-9 (dagger +2), or 1-4

#### SL10A-23: Inner Reading Room

* The door to this room is locked.
	* Keys are held only by Master Malachite (SL10A-32) and Sir Ennius (SL10A-21).
* The chamber is undecorated granite.
	* A simple wooden work desk, with a wooden chair, holds a fully operational rudishva GnuCoder 5000 full-immersion sensory experience and 4 greater rudishva power supplies (tech).
	* Next to the GnuCoder is a chest with a score of data crystals (tech).
		* These data crystals comprise a linear history of the Sun-Scarred Knights: their formation during the last years of the rudishva hegemony, hidden existence for most of the Archontean period, and return as arbiters of a certain kind of status quo in the past eight centuries.
		* The most useful crystal is 'The Formation of the Harmonious Brotherhood' (books).

#### SL10A-24: Solar Chapel

* The chapel is perfectly proportioned, with a 30’ ceiling, octagonal black-marble sheathing, and a checkerboard floor of black-and-white octagonal marble.
	* A shaft of sunlight emerges from a set of light wells in the ceiling, illuminating a simple red porphyry altar at the north end of the chamber.
		* On the altar is a bonzai garden, with a 3’ shaped pine and an assortment of polished river stones in various colors.  Beside it is a pair of shears and a small watering can.
		* The altar can be moved with a bend bars check, revealing a sloping natural passageway heading north.
			* None of the knights are aware of this tunnel.
	* In front of the altar are six 10’-long wooden benches in two columns.
		* Behind them is a 20’x20’ carpet featuring a blazing sun (450 gp).
	* Secret Doors (south): hard to find (1 in 8), and only Master Malachite knows of it.
		* Inserting a 1” rod into a hole 12’ up the face of the south wall opens it.
		* The corridor leading south is 5’ wide and rough carved.
		* The secret door to SL10A-25 is obvious (1 in 3), opening by a catch on the wall.

GM Note
* Although called the solar ‘chapel’, no deity is associated with this chamber and it is not actually ‘holy’ in any sense.
* Master Malachite intended it to provide a non-denominational spiritual focus for his order.  It is rarely used, except by those knights who require some space for meditation.
	* Sir Spes, the beastman knight, frequently comes here to meditate and practice a series of poses that resemble tai-chi.
	* A few other knights, both past and present, have secretly used the chapel to worship solar deities from ‘real’ pantheons (e.g. Horus and Seker in the old days, and Mitra and Atashak in the present).
	* Of the current knights, only Sir Hegemon (SL10B-19) harbors any religious beliefs.

Sir Spes, the Sun-Scarred Knight (see new monsters), 9th-level female beastman fighter: SZ S; AL LN; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 9; HP 82; #AT 3/2; Dmg 5-10 (short sword +3), 2-5 (dagger), or 
4-7 (light crossbow with bolts +3). Abilities: STR 17, INT 15, WIS 14, DEX 11, CON 15, CHA 8. Possessions: key to SL10A-16, gothic armor and sun lance (see new technological items); solar ring; circlet of command; backpack of capacity (see new magic items for all three); short sword +3; dagger; light crossbow with 12 bolts +3. 

#### SL10A-25: Secret Chamber

* This chamber is undecorated, with unfinished surfaces.
	* A battered wooden bench and three 3’ x 4’ x 3’ chests comprise its contents.
		* Chests: 17,931 cp, 11,459 sp, and 4,182 gp. 
	* Originally conceived as a hidden treasury.
		* The knights have ceased to use it for this function since the citadel seems impregnable and this chamber is difficult to access from the solar.  It is known to most knights, but few visit it. 
		* Malachite (SL10A-32) might use it is a refuge if hard-pressed.
	* Secret Door (north): difficult to find (1 in 8), from this side it must be pried open (open door check) given a way to gain purchase on it to pull.
	* Secret Door (south): opens by pulling the hidden panel.
		* Reveals a 3’-square tunnel leading to the solar (SL10A-21).

#### SL10A-26: Triple Doors

* Three 15’ doors made of carved ebony lead from the cloister to the inner sanctum.
	* The doors are not locked, but are heavy (open doors w/ +1).
	* Each is carved in floral patterns, with a leering, horned, devil face in the center.
		* The faces having gaping mouths, which serve as (harmless) door handles.
	* The short hallway within is sheathed in octagonal slabs of white marble.

#### SL10A-27: Burial Cavern of the Knights

* This semi-worked cavern rises 100’ from floor to ceiling.
	* The north wall has been flattened, and the east and west walls have been shaped and flattened.
	* The entrance corridor (SL10A-26) and the norther ledge of the master (SL10A-30) are 20’ below the ceiling.
	* The scarification platform (SL10A-28) is 50’ below the ceiling.
	* The floor of the cavern is covered in 15’ of cold, clear water.
	* The simple tombs of previous knights are set into the side walls.
		* There are 250 tombs, 219 occupied (there have actually been 257 knights, but the corpses of 38 were never recovered).
		* In keeping with the collective ethos of the sept, tombs are unmarked, and nearly bereft of grave goods.  Each holds a well-preserved (not mummified) body wrapped in white linen, with a copper sunburst amulet (10 sp).
	* It is deathly quiet and bereft of almost all life.
		* Growing amid the water are three-score weird columnar formations of multicolored matter.  They sway in the water, their tops just protruding (~6”).
		* The formulations are chemoautotrophs, thriving on the carbon dioxide slowly bubbling up from the floor of the chamber.
			* The harmless formations are a mixture of yellow, green, and pale blue, and spongy to the touch.
			* Sunken amid the columns are scores of broken rudishva weapons, some discarded when they ceased functioning but others purposefully smashed.

#### SL10A-28: Scarification Platform

* Atop a slender (10’-diameter) column of rock rising 50’ from the floor of the cavern sits the central ritual site for the knights.
	* Known as the scarification platform, it is where varlets are ritually transformed into Sun-Scarred Knights.
	* Atop the platform is a stone table about 4.5’ tall, a copper knife, and a copper basin.
	* At one end of the table’s top is a slot 3” long, ½” wide, and 6” deep.
		* Inserting a thin metal object (e.g., the nearby copper knife) into the slot causes a triangular, telescoping, plasteel bridge (similar to those at SL10A-11) to extend from the platform towards SL10A-30 (remaining as long as the object is in place).
			* Given the height differences of the ends, it is quite steep.
	* At the other end of the table is a semi-circular indentation about 1” in diameter.
		* The interior is carved to resemble a beetle (designed for the solar rings) worn by all of the knights (with their scarab beetle stones).
		* Pressing a solar ring into the indentation for 10 seconds causes a metal door to open in the roof of the cavern, allowing a 20’-diameter shaft of sunlight to bathe the center of the platform.

The ritual of induction involves several steps.

1. All existing knights join Master Malachite on the platform, surrounding the candidate, who lies on the stone table. They greet them and ask if he is ready to join the brotherhood. They agree, and utters an oath of fidelity to the Master and the other brothers.
2. Master Malachite opens a vein on his arm with the copper knife, and collects his blood in the copper basin.
	* The new member drinks.
3. Two of the senior knights carve ritual marks into the face and forehead of the new knight, while the rest of the sept chants the knights’ credo
4. The most senior knight presses his/her solar ring into the indentation, causing the platform to be bathed in sunlight.
5. The vampiric blood in the knight burns, exposed to sunlight via the cuts, searing the black scars permanently into their flesh.  Master Malachite steps into the sunlight a moment, his flesh smoking, as a sign of shared willingness to suffer with the new knight.

#### SL10A-29: Cave, with Tunnel to 6-39h

* Within the last few months a strange and unique heqeti slime (see new monsters) has eaten its way through a vein of granite with a specific and very narrow range of hardness on the moh scale.
	* It followed that vein from Level 6 to this location, discovering and gradually consuming the corpses of long-dead knights here.
	* If unchecked, it will devour one corpse per week, eating its way into the Master’s sanctum within 6 months, and then being destroyed by the Master.

1 unique plum-colored heqeti slime (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 10’; HD 6; HP 33; #AT 1; Dmg special; MR 15%. Special attacks: stone-eating; flesh-eating for 4-7 rounds; 
corrosive to metal. Special defenses: healed by electricity or lasers; slowed by cold.

#### SL10A-30: Master’s Sanctum: Entrance 

* The entrance to the sanctum of Master Malachite is an unassuming ledge on the north wall of the cavern (SL10A-27), 20’ from the ceiling and 80’ above the floor of the cavern.
	* It leads to an iron door on which is painted a yellow sunburst.
	* The door (unlocked) has a dozen 1”-holes drilled through it.
	* Note: the ledge is accessible from the scarification platform if the bridge has been activated (see SL10A-28).

#### SL10A-31: Master’s Sanctum: Antechamber

* This chamber is sheathed in octagonal slabs of black marble withrounded corners, everywhere save the north wall.
	* The east and west walls have been whitewashed and frescoes painted atop them.
		* East: in ancient Archontean style, seven rudishva in black tactical suits stand in a chamber, gesturing with their right hands to a tunnel leading outside in the bright sunshine.
			* Each rudishva was originally named, in Mithric, but the names of six have been erased: only Melok-Ri remains.
		* West: a rudishva in tactical suit surrounded by hundreds of humans and demi-humans, all in the gothic armor of the knights.
			* An enormous ‘group portrait’ of all generations of the knights, with 257 separate companions.  Some are faded, painted (and retouched) centuries ago. The current knights are smaller (in the background) and in more vibrant colors.
	* The north wall is native granite that has been polished to a reflective sheen.
		* Three 3”-diameter holes lead from the wall to SL10A-32, allowing Master Malachite to pass through in gaseous form.
		* Sixteen copper pins have been inserted into the granite, each dangling a black silk ribbon.  Four of the ribbons are tied around pieces of rolled parchment. 
			* The parchments are petitions submitted by four of the knights to the Master, following ancient ritual.
	* In the center of the chamber is a wooden tripod supporting a bronze bell; a copper striker attached to the frame by a cord.
		* Beside it is an open chest filled with rudishva jumpsuits of various colors.
		* If rung multiple times, the knights will assume it means a convocation, and will gather in SL10B; the failure of the Master to appear serves to alert them to the presence of intruders in the Sanctum.
		* If rung once, a random knight will appear in 3-6 turns to collect the master’s reply; when it is not to be found, he/she will immediately raise the alarm.

Petitioning
* A knight can offer a petition at any time.
* Once per week the Master collects and reads them, and renders a decision.
	* If the decision requires immediate action, the Master emerges and rings the bell five times; the knights know all available knights and varlets are expected to report to SL10B-30 for convocation.
	* If the decision does not require immediate action, the Master rings the bell once and leaves a hand-written answer by the bell. 

The current petitions attached to the wall are:
1. “Master, allow me to search for Sixth. His return is badly overdue. [signed] Spes.”
	* GM: Sir Sixth is currently senseless and lost in 6-39; Sir Spes requests permission to locate and aid him.
2. “Master, I am concerned at the paucity of postulants. Allow me to take several goblins, humans or halflings from the upper levels and subject them to the trials. [signed] Calculor.” 
	* GM: Sir Calculor is currently away on a short mission; he hopes his request will be addressed before his return.
	* Alternate: he encourages the gathering of more children or as postulants.  Or perhaps gladiators from the arena?
3. “Master, [the GM should write a short note describing a recent adventure/action taken by the PCs within Arden Vul.] This group is dangerous and needs watching ... or elimination. Give me the honor of seeing to it. [signed] 
	* Discord.” GM: the point is to convey to PCs that their actions have been observed by the knights, and that one – Discord – would like to take proscriptive action against them. Discord is currently located at 8-116.
4. “Master, the new group of human mages has mustered a large expedition into the old heqeti areas at the foot of the chasm. They are well-organized and extremely dangerous. I fear that, if left unchecked, they will disturb the balance of power we have so carefully worked to achieve. Their strength is such that a combined assault may be necessary to eliminate them. Your wisdom in this matter is desired. [signed] Ennius.” 
	* GM: Sir Ennius (SL10B-29) is referring to the Priscian encampment at 9-31.

#### SL10A-32: Master’s Sanctum: Master’s Chamber

* This richly appointed chamber is the private residence of Master Malachite, leader of the Sun-Scarred Knights.
	* Malachite was originally known as Melok-Ri, a rudishva of the crew of the Beacon.
	* An incredibly ancient being, Malachite is content these days to spend most of his time here, in contemplation.

* The chamber is sheathed in octagonal slabs of black marble, complete with rounded corners.
	* Eight rudishva light globes (tech) protrude from steel rods set in the walls.
	* To the east is Malachite’s private relaxation area.
		* A 20’ x 20’ plush Archontean carpet featuring dragons lines the floor (1,500 gp).
		* An uncomfortable-looking, orange plasteel, rudishva-style bed, salvaged from elsewhere in the halls
		* 2 armchairs (an orange rudishva seat and a plush leather club chair).
		* A wine rack has a a wide selection.
			* A dozen bottles of good recent Archontean wine (40-120 gp per bottle), 3 bottles of truly excellent vintage wine (250 gp per bottle), and 3 plasteel ‘bottles’ of rudishva aquavit (av items, 300 gp each). 
		* The bookshelf is close to empty, as Malachite has given up reading over the past few centuries.
			* It contains: Prosperity in the Eternal Now, by Redip-Beq; On the Terrible Old Gods, by Sarquin of Archontos; The Politics, by Teracleon; On Friends and Enemies, by Teracleon; Properties of Arcanum; True Tales of Larel One-Eyed; Harmony through Brotherhood, by Isok-Crix; Words and Symbols: an attempt to understand the symbols of the Old Ones, by Hanon the Scribe; and Poetic Interludes, by Nerix-Vaj.
	* To the west is Malachite’s working area.
		* A plush, 20’ x 20’ carpet with scenes from the tales of Larel One-Eye (350 gp).
		* A blue leather settee.
		* A desk entirely of ivory (4250 gp, 4d6 under INT to disassemble for transport).
			* It contains various notes about Malachite’s current goals (see below).
			* Above the desk is a corkboard with a parchment map of the floor of the Great Chasm (Level 9), with most geographic features indicated and some temporary additions in pencil.
				* ‘strange hunters’ at 9-50; ‘mushrooms’ at 9-6; and next to ‘ancient bridge’, an arrow and text reading ‘powerful magicians’ (i.e., 9-31).
		* A troll chest keyed to Malchite (tech).
			* A full set of glass activation squares; a parchment quire with addresses to all Thothian teleportation rings; and maps of all of the Archontean areas of Arden Vul (Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and parts of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).
				* 20% a secret door/room is indicated, and 25-75% (depending on the prominence of the tunnel/cave to the neighboring worked areas) a natural tunnel / cave system is indicated.
	* In the northern niche hangs a 6’-tall, egg-shaped object of bright yellow plasteel.
		* It is one of only two operative rudishva portable medical units (tech) (the other is at 6-85).
			* This device has helped to ensure Malachite’s longevity and continued health in the long millennia since the collapse of the rudishva hegemony.
			* His vampirism, however, rendered use of the medical unit less imperative (and, strangely, the unit was unable to ‘cure’ Malachite of this condition).
			* For this reason his memories are sharper than those of the Lord of Arena (6-85), whose similar treatment has slowly eroded his memories.
				* GM Note: He's a full vamp, doesn't need the med unit for longevity, but he uses it (with neuroderm) to produce synthetic blood to drink, and to create the Draught of Fidelity for the knights (SL10B-30).
		* Beneath the medical unit is a 3’ x 6’ x 4’ block of yellow plasteel, pierced with holes of various size and direction.
			* It was a piece of rudishva art (looks to humans like Swiss cheese) and serves as a display table for some of Malachite’s treasured items.
				* Beneath the block (open doors to move) is a hole down 15’ to a tunnel to SL10A-33.
			* On the table:
				* A Beacon crew-tag, in yellow plasteel, reading ‘Melok-Ri’ in Glyphik
				* Rust, brown, sky blue, silver, and platinum rudishva identity plaques
				* Two 6”-cubes of plastic containing ‘moving pictures’ (holographs)
					* 2 rudishva in flowing robes (his parents)
					* 7 rudishva in official military gear (Melok-Ri and his friends)
				* A slim piece of orange plasteel with numerous Rudishva glyphs
					* The initial compact forming the Harmonious Brotherhood, the predecessors of the Knights.
				* A porcelain tea service of exquisite quality (225 gp).


Malachite’s Actions
* Malchite rarely leaves his sanctum these days.
* There is only a 33% chance he responds to a general alarm in the Citadel (see SL10B-2).
* If surprised in his sanctum, where he has few weapons or defenses, he immediately reverts to gaseous form, and flees down the tunnel to SL10A-33 to equip himself and then to SL10A-34, to take stock of the situation. 
	* If he is being pursued, he retreats to SL10A-24 and then attempts to retreat to the Citadel (SL10B) to rally any remaining allies.
	* If not pursued, he may wait in SL10A-34 until foes depart (66%) or attempt to surprise and confront those who have invaded his sanctum (33%). 
* As a vampire he is capable energy drain, but Malachite has sworn a vow not to create any new vampires; he uses his energy drain only in extremis.

		* Sir Philautia then uses the speaking tube to warn off visitors who typically have only a few moments to either retreat or convince the knights that their mission/question is worth discussion before the inhabitants of the hall resort to defensive missile fire.

	* The portcullis is heavy (-5% to lift) and slides into holes in the floor.
	* The inner door is solid oak bound with iron; barred from the citadel side.
	* The winch for the portcullis is in the hallway south of the inner door.

#### SL10B-25: Spare Chamber

* This chamber is currently unoccupied has just the general feature of a knight's chamber.

#### SL10B-26: Ricchar Wither-Hand

* The resident mage of the citadel, Ricchar Wither-Hand, dwells in this large chamber, along with his apprentice, Jolene.
* The room is divided into thirds by two heavy floor-to-ceiling drapes.
	* The western third is Ricchar’s private area.
		* A heavy wooden bed piled high with comfortable silk sheets and pillows
		* A wardrobe holds a fine selection of high quality fashionable clothing, only 20 years out of date (275 gp total).
		* His ‘thinking chair’ and a chess table.
			* The chess pieces are solid copper (55 gp).
			* His spell book is always by the table.
	* The eastern third is for storage and Jolene’s cot.
		* Floor-to-ceiling shelving holds a variety of magical supplies.
			* 75% chance any material component for standard spells may be found here with 1-3 turns of searching.
			* The entire lot of components is worth 15,000 gp.
			* 400 sp worth of silver thread; twenty bloodstones (50 gp each); thirteen vials of oil; and two flasks of holy water (other things as the GM decides).
		* Against the keep's outer wall is a built-in cupboard that serves as Jolene’s bed.
			* In the drawers beneath the bed are some personal items: a pair of platinum earrings (325 gp), a greater salt lamp of protection, potions (of truthfulness, of singing birds; new).
	* The center is where the pair work on magical experiments.
		* Against the back wall are numerous bulls-eye targets, all scorched with energy blasts.
			* Two cloth manikins also show signs of charring.
			* A third figure is a flesh golem, nicknamed Speedy, who protects the area.
		* Work tables flank the entrance, one with an alchemical apparatus and the other with general magic user gear (10,000 gp total).
			* General bench: a wand of conjuration that Ricchar recently recharged (100 charges).
		* Hanging from the ceiling are the cleaned skeletons of a human, a heqeti hopper, and a rudishva.

* GM Notes: The knights always have a resident wizard to help protect the keep and assist them with magical needs.
	* The process of selecting a suitable apprentice to the current magician is a rigorous one, as temperament is as important as magical talent.  The wizards rarely leave the keep and must then be content with a relatively circumscribed life.

Ricchar Wither-Hand
* A spry Wiskin in his late 60s; he has lived in the Keep since he was 15 and is entirely content with his life.
* He is not an innovator, content to perfect his techniques and live a good life rather than develop new spells.
* His nickname, “Wither-Hand”, is from an accident that rendered one hand charred and blackened (though still functional).
* Ricchar knows of Sir Ennius’s training, and the two are close allies.
	* Despite Ennius’s skill at magic, Ricchar is the designated ‘court wizard’, and he is the one to whom the rest of the knights turn when in need of magical consultation.

Jolene
* A 32-year old female who is chafing a bit at her subordinate role.
* While loyal to the knights, she would like to see Ricchar retire (or even die) so that she could implement some greater magic innovation, including new spells and new items.

* Only one varlet, Jacinth, is currently present, asleep in his cubicle. 

Varlets
* Chosen from postulants who voluntarily seek admission to the order or who are identified by the knights as likely subjects.
* The knights prefer to take varlets as adolescents (this has proven harder) since the Archontean withdrawal from Arden Vul.
* For a long time only humans and demi-humans were taken as varlets, but recently the first beastman has passed the tests.  Some knights predict that a goblin varlet will be next.
* Varlets train alongside a specific knight, serving and learning from them.
	* They are assigned a name by their knight.
	* When their knight dies or ‘joins the master’ (see SL10A-32), the varlet takes his/her place as a knight, adopting a new name and searching for his/her own varlet.
	* It is customary for a knight to be served by a single varlet, although for complex reasons Sir Sixth has recently had two.
