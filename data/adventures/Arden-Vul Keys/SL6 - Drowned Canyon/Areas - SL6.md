## Overview

This sub-level was discovered in antiquity and used by all of the intelligent factions who occupied the Halls. A permanent geyser to the west produces a never-ending stream of relatively warm water (~75 degrees), which fills a small lake before cascading down some rapids to a waterfall that pours into a steep-walled canyon.

Originally the water level was much lower than it is now, a fact which explains why numerous now-submerged tomb-openings may be found in the canyon walls. With the more recent damming of the canyon (SL6-25), the water level has risen so as to cover many of the openings, partially or fully flooding some of those tomb-openings (and also permanently flooding Sub-Level 7, the Flooded Vaults).

The lake and canyon are home to numerous fish, eels, and crayfish, most notably a colossal moray eel, a pair of giant pike, and some giant crayfish. Due to the food potential of the area, it has become the site of running battles between the fishmen (see new monsters) from the Flooded Vaults (Sub-Level 7) and the lizardmen who oppose them (Sub-Level 5). The other significant feature of the level is the hidden Tower of Pol (SL6-17), the home of a powerful and eccentric wizard.

Unlike most other levels of Arden Vul, The Drowned Canyon is divided into two maps because of its size and three dimensional complexity.
* The first map (The Drowned Canyon) contains areas SL6-1 through SL6-37.
* The second map (The Drowned Canyon, Tomb Level) contains the remainder of the encounter areas.

General Construction Notes
* Heqeti areas: SL6-4, SL6-6, SL6-35
* Rudishva areas: SL6-3, SL6-27, SL6-32, SL6-37
* Archontean areas: all other worked areas

Iconic Areas

### The Tombs of the Drowned Canyon

During the early centuries of the Archontean hegemony in Arden Vul, it became fashionable for archons and other important imperial officials to carve their burial tombs into the walls of the Canyon (before, of course, it was ‘drowned’). These tombs are accessible via a series of fourteen openings delved into the Canyon walls.

Some of the openings are well-fashioned corridors, but others are rough-carved or even natural tunnels. While all were originally constructed above the water line, the emergence of the Reiv-Tor in the Flooded Vaults (SL7-23) and the subsequent ‘drowning’ of the canyon has meant that many of the tombs are flooded.

The GM should pay close attention to the height of a tomb opening relative to the current water level. On the map these relative elevations are represented with a negative number in feet, which indicates how far below the main cavern floor (i.e., SL6-11 and SL6-30) each opening lies.  An important benchmark is the current water level in the canyon; the water line is at present at -45’ (i.e., 45’ below the level of the main cave floor).

To take an example, the corridor opening at SL6-38 is at -60’. This means that the floor of this particular corridor is 60’ below the cavern floor, and 15’ below the water line of the Canyon. As this corridor is 10’ tall, its opening is completely submerged; but since this corridor quickly runs into a set of stairs that rise 20’, however, the door to SL6-42 is dry. Movement and combat in completely submerged tombs carries the usual restrictions appropriate to underwater action.

It is also important for the GM to consider the air supply in some of the dry tombs (e.g., SL6-42, SL6-43, SL6-47, SL6-48, and areas SL6-72 to SL6-79). In these cases, the air is stale and cannot be replenished (unless the dam at SL6-25 is destroyed and the water level drops). 

Prolonged activity in these areas will use up the oxygen in the air, slowly rendering those areas poisonous as the percentage of oxygen drops and the percentage of carbon dioxide 
rises. The rate of decline in air quality is accentuated by a number of factors: higher breathing rate through hard exercise (e.g., combat); the use of torches; and/or the creation or employment of fire (e.g., cooking fires or fireballs).

See the Air Supply Modification Table for guidelines in reducing supply duration in those areas where the supply of oxygen is fixed. All other dry areas are linked to the main cavern air supply and do not suffer these penalties.

### Air Supply Modification Table

## Sub-Level 6: 1 - 15 (Upper)

### SL6-1: Lake and River

* The water of this small lake roils with turbulence caused by the huge geyser at its center, gushing a 15'-wide column of water 50’ into the air.
	* The rocky basin is 50’ deep at the western edge, and the water is 5’ below the natural floor of the surrounding cavern.
	* As the water flows east, the bed becomes shallower and the current stronger.
		* One swimming either channel flanking the island (SL6-2) must roll 3d8 under STR or be swept across the rapids (SL6-1a) and down the waterfall (SL6-1b).
	* The geyser is quite noisy.  Conversation is difficult around the lake, and Listen checks within 70’ of the geyser are at -1.
* The lake is the abode of a deadly hydrodaemon (secret name: Pisscatig).
	* The hydrodaemon is an ally of Kauket, and has lived here for about a millennium.
	* The lizardmen fear and placate it with offerings of fish, dead fishmen, and tokens.
	* It watches parties exploring the lake and island before leaping into combat using its dimension door and glide powers.
	* It will happily summon a water elemental, but loathes to attempt to gate in another hydrodaemon, doing so only in extremis.
	* The hydrodaemon tolerates the existence of two phase salamanders, who live and hunt along the banks of the lake.
* A large chitinous chest rests on the bottom of the lake, close to the island.
	* 3,977 gp pierced and strung on ribbons of dried human flesh
	* An elaborately carved platinum box (3’x1’x1’) depicting hunting elven warriors (12,500 gp)
	* 5 azurites (20 gp each); 5 rock crystals (50 gp each); a bloodstone (50 gp); a small black opal (750 gp)
	* A silver coffer sealed with wax, holding 2 scrolls (Kentillian’s animate water, Kentillian’s airy command).

##### SL6-1a: Rapids

* The lake water passes over rocky spurs, dropping 10’ (1d6+1 dmg if swept over).

##### SL6-1b: Falls

* The river drops a further 30’ into the canyon proper as it passes over a hard granite ledge.
	* If caught in the current, 4d6 under STR to struggle to the bank and hold on for dear life, or be swept over the falls (2d4 and cause a large splash, 66% chance to attract the colossal eel, SL6-24).

### SL6-2: Island with Statue

* A small island rises 15’ above the the lake (5’ above the surrounding pavements).
* A 10’-diameter granite pediment holds a stained and bespattered 12'-tall marble statue of an Archontean woman dressed in archaic heavy armor.
	* The statue depicts Cassandra Rubea (‘the red’), aka ‘the easily angered’, a once-important but now-forgotten archon, overshadowed her successor, the great Marius Tricotor.
	* Cassandra has unusually short hair and an intent scowl and furrowed brow, gesturing east with a naked gladius.
	* The statue is covered with grime, guano, and other unpleasantries. 
		* Cleaning reveals an inscription (Mithric) on the backplate of her armor: “Cassandra Rubea, archon of Arden Vul, who cleansed this water course of the demon-spawned heqeti.”
* A pile of rubble lies northwest of the statue, ancient and covered with moss and algae.
	* The lizardmen (from SL-5) recently placed a few clay tokens of crouching amphibians reverently on top of the moss.
	* The rubble prove to be the remains of a far older heqeti statue, rough and primitive, overturned after the Archontean victory here.
		* Pieces depict a salamander-ish being with fanged lower incisors, a rudimentary tail, and powerful legs and arms; an enormous heqeti warrior and a shrine of Kauket (still radiating strongly of evil).
		* Beneath the rubble is a hide quiver with 6 heqeti barbed arrows, poisoned with Kauket’s vision (av items).
* Those who spend more than 2 turns poking around on the island are sure to attract the attention of the hydrodaemon at SL6-1.

##### SL6-2a: Broken Bridge

* This stone bridge was a delicate, segmented single arch, 5' wide and rising 10’ above the cavern floor.
	* It was broken in antiquity, leaving a 10’ gap between its surviving segments. 

### SL6-2B: Bridge

* This stone bridge was a delicate, segmented single arch, 5' wide and rising 10’ above the cavern floor.
	* It is sturdy and safe.

### SL6-3: Hidden Passage to Rudishva Chamber

* The rudishva iris door leading to this chamber lies directly west of the geyser (find as a secret door due to the noise and turbulent water).
	* Opens to a pale green, orange, pink, silver, or yellow rudishva identity plaque.
* The 8’-wide passageway has no right angles and is coated in dusty, but intact white tiles.
	* It leads to a similar-looking chamber.
* The rudishva used this room as a base while they visited the Drowned Canyon.
	* The center of the chamber contains a still-working nutrition station.
		* A sickle-shaped counter (4’x4’x4’).  On the concave side are 3 curved yellow tubes extending from the counter over a silvered plate. Colored buttons cause tubes to spurt one of six varieties of high-protein, high-vitamin food paste (not very appetizing, but highly nutritious) onto the silver ‘plate’.
	* On the south wall is a pair of bunk beds constructed of painted (white) wood. 
		* Abandoned underneath is a fully charged rudishva lesser power supply (tech).
	* To the east is a teleport node, a 5’-diameter silvery disc inset into the floor.
		* T13: access to 5-31

### SL6-4: Heqeti Aerie

* This ancient chamber has remained undiscovered for more than two millennia; originally a heqeti scout-post to observe activity in the region.
	* It is located 70’ up, within the rock wall that flanks the lake.
	* Two passages, 4’ wide and 6’ tall, allow observation of areas SL6-5, SL6-1, and SL6-2.
	* The chamber’s walls are pebbled and oily.
	* The corpses of two heqeti hoppers lie on the floor.
		* They have into large heqeti slime zombies (new) rising to confront all intruders. 
	* The east wall has an unusual half-round sculpture of Rimmaq-Isfet carved into it.
		* The inscrutable evil god takes the form of a salamander with squid tentacles protruding from its mouth, brandishomg a harpoon in his small arms.
		* It appears wet and viscous, as if a mucus membrane is covering it (caused by a variety of heqeti slime that soaks up and relates a message).
			* Any stepping within 5’ of it hear (Heqeti): “The Devourer is displeased with our efforts. Punishment shall befall all those who fail to carry the war to the humans. The dread lord sends a new ally, Pisscatig, to accomplish what the heqeti could not. For your failures, you will serve Rimmaq-Isfet in other ways!”
			* GM Note: the message refers to the wars of the heqeti and the Archonteans. It reveals the private name of the hydrodaemon in SL2-1.
		* Beneath the sculpture is a silk pouch with 3 tears of Kauket (new).

2 heqeti slime zombies: SZ L; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 42, 35; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: slime infestation. Special defenses: immune to electricity.

##### SL6-4a: Stairs Down to 9-125

* These stairs lead down several hundred feet from the heqeti aerie to 9-125. 

### SL6-5: Wizard Duel

* A platform of worked granite blocks rises 10’ from the (natural) floor of the cave.
	* 12 slim porphyry columns, 3’ across and 15’ tall, form an alley along the platform within which two statues depicting magic users face each other.
	* In the center of the alley, between the two ==statues==, white a marble pentagram 5' in diameter is inset into the granite.
		* Inscribed in its center in a magical script legible with read magic: “The Tower of Pol shall be revealed to those who demonstrate their art.”
		* Standing on the pentagram and casting an arcane spell (any type) causes the caster and all within 10’ to be teleported to area SL6-17.
	* Scattered along the north, south, and west of the platform are the worn fragments of other statues, features effaced by time and vandalism.
		* Despite this debris, no other obvious pediments for statues exist near this location; the current pair of statues occupies the only suitable locations.

Statues
* Two life-sized, highly realistic granite statues face each other across the platform.
	* Eastern statue: a male elf in body-fitting leathers crouching as he points a wand towards the west. He wears a skullcap and backpack, and is grasping for a pouch at his belt.  The circular pediment on which he stands reads (fresh-looking Mithric script): Erist Ellagelsson. Zero years.
	* Western statue: a tall human female, in flowing robes and a soft cap. She carries no equipment. Her arms and hands are caught in the midst of spell-casting gestures.  The inscription (Mithric) on her pediment reads Gemma of Arcturos, 173 years. 
* They are the petrified forms of the prior two unsuccessful challengers to lordship of the Tower of Pol (SL6-17).
	* They detect as magic and can be restored by normal means.
	* Should a new claimant defeat Basil (SL6-17A), current lord of the Tower of Pol, Erist’s statue will shatter and a statue of Basil (inscribed ‘Basil Choumnos, 37 years’) will take his place. 

Erist Ellagelsson
* Son of Lady Ellagel, one of the powerful elven lords in the Realm of Gallador.
* He located the Tower about 75 years ago and challenged its chatelaine (Gemma), but was defeated and, as a consequence, petrified.
* Erist’s half-brother, Hallor, is searching for his lost sibling (7-76f).
* If restored to flesh Erist will thank his rescuers profusely.
	* He is funny and wry, and might agree to work with good-aligned parties.
	* He is anxious for news of the fate of his companion (and lover, although he does not reveal this), Ketra Jiran (see 9-18) and hopes any new companions will help him to look for her.

Gemma of Arcturos
* She had been chatelaine for 173 years before being defeated 37 years ago by Basil Choumnos, the current lord (see SL6-17).
* If returned to life, Gemma acts imperiously; she demanding service as her right, and orders rescuers to help her to reclaim her ‘rightful’ lordship of the Tower of Pol.
	* Gemma is hampered because her spell book is still within the Tower (SL6-17A).
	* She can be tricked by flattery into revealing the operation of the pentagram.

GM Note: Information about the Tower of Pol and the strange customs that regulate it may be obtained through the assiduous – and lucky - searching of the compartments under the cobblestones at area SL6-6.

Erist Ellagelsson, 5th-level male elf magic user: SZ M; AL CG; AC 6; MV 120’; HD 5; HP 15; #AT 1; Dmg by 1-4 (dagger). Abilities: STR 12, INT 17, WIS 15, DEX 17, CON 9, CHA 11.

CHA 12. Possessions: staff of striking (13 charges); dagger; bracers of defense (AC 4); brooch of shielding (48 HP left); wand of conjuration (32 charges). Memorized spells: armor, magic missile, taunt; detect invisibility, levitate, hideous laughter; dispel magic, monster summoning I; stoneskin; feeblemind (all other spells were used during her duel with Basil Choumnos).

### SL6-6: Cobblestoned Pavement, North

* This section of floor rises 5' above the natural floor of the north side of the river (SL6-1), covered in an heqeti-era pavement of irregular, dry-fitted cobblestones.
	* It is accessed from the natural floor by two short flights of stairs.
	* The cobblestones average 3’ x 2’ in size (~1400 cobbles in all).
		* If pried up, each has a 1’-square cavity beneath (1-in-4 chance of an object).

D20 Object Notes (skulls weight 8 lbs)
* 1-6 Skull, human
* 7-12 Skull, heqeti
* 13-14 Skull, varumani
* 15 Skull, varuda
* 16 Skull, rudishva
* 17 Folded wad of parchment
	* The testament of Skarphedin of Westholm (books).
	* Once the testament has been found, treat rolls of 17 as ‘skull, animal’
* 18-19 Random object, deposited by later visitors (d8)
	* 1-4: piece of adventuring gear
	* 5: helmet and dagger (10% chance it is a dagger +1)
	* 6: treasure map (GM’s choice)
	* 7: scroll case, 15% chance it is filled with a level 1-5 MU spell 
	* 8: small cache of coins or gems worth 50-400 gp 
* 20 Special Object (d6, d17 on this chart to find skull type)
	* 1-2: silver skull (300 gp, 33% chance to be cursed, 8 to be found)
	* 3-4: gold skull (1500 gp, 50% chance to be cursed, 4 to be found)
	* 5-6: platinum skull (3500 gp, 66% chance to be cursed, 1 to be found)

### SL6-7: Stairs Up to 3-87

* These stairs are carved into a huge natural pillar of rock.
	* A locked iron grating blocks the stairs 30’ up.
		* Old and easily picked (+10%) or broken (+1 to open doors).
	* Beyond the grating, the stairs rise steeply over 550’ to 3-87.
		* Those ascending from SL6 likely alert the wight in 3-86, who waits to ambush those who emerge, tired, from the long climb.

### SL6-8: Stone Face of Pol

* On the west side of this huge natural pillar is carved a 5’-tall, half-round representation of a grinning human face.
	* The face is that of Pol, the infamous Grinning Mage. 
	* Pol has short, curly hair, a long, hooked nose, eyes creased with laugh lines, and a grinning mouth. 
	* The carving contains sixteen 6”-wide slots into which teeth were placed., but the mouth is currently empty. 

Activating the Stone Head
* If any ivory teeth of Pol (new) are inserted into the mouth, they fuse into the jaw and the head will activate and interact with passers-by.
* A tooth can only be removed with a dispel magic (12th level); one tooth per dispel.
* How much interactivity the head obtains depends of the number of teeth inserted.
	* Pol never loses lower-level functions as more teeth are added.

Number of Teeth - Pol’s INT - Notes
* 1-6 Low (3-8)
	* Pol cracks crude, unfunny jokes and generally acts like a drunken fool. He can describe comings and goings and issue rough, unspecific warnings
* 7-12 Average (9-12)
	* Pol’s jokes are better, if still predictable. He actively solicits new jokes. He can explain how to access the Tower of Pol (SL6-17A) and the dueling process. He can detect magic at will, and will do so in return for new jokes or riddles.
* 13-15 High (13-18)
	* Pol puns cleverly, and his jokes are sophisticated (if somewhat out of date). He is self-aware, and attempts to trade information for the recovery of his remaining teeth. He can identify magic items, but will do so only if a new tooth is provided (one tooth per casting). He can cast magic missile (8x/day, at 16th level) if attacked.
* 16 Supra intelligent (19)
	* Pol ceases to joke, as the humor now resides solely within his own mind. He now develops agendas, mostly to do with information pertinent to the current state of the Halls. To aid in pursuing these agendas, Pol can now cast charm monster, charm person, mass charm, feeblemind, and geas, and will do so (25% chance) if pestered for information.

Pol's Background
* Pol was the first Archontean to discover the Drowned Canyon, and was the architect of the Tower of Pol (see SL6-6 and SL6-17A).
* At the end of his long life, unbeaten by claimants to his stewardship of the Tower, Pol pursued a unique immortality, transferring his consciousness to this carven image.
	* Pol’s famously impish personality was implanted, but his intelligence was linked to the ivory teeth.  
	* When all 16 are present, Pol emerges as more powerful, more dangerous, and less friendly.  He develops and attempts to implement complex, long-term strategies, and uses magic to ‘recruit’ agents to assist him. Pol ceases to interact in the former jovial manner, instead presenting a cold, rational, driven demeanor when consulted.

Pol’s Agenda
* What Pol actually wants is up to the GM to determine, but should be abstruse and annoying (after all he’s a stone head!).
* He likely seeks obscure arcane tomes and spells, and perhaps a way to allow his consciousness to travel the Astral Plane.
* He ruthlessly attempts to charm and compel those he encounters (with geas) to procure information and/or objects that may assist him in this plan.

Neutralizing or Destroying Pol
* Pol is AC -2, is hit only by +2 weapons, has 25% MR, and requires 50 HP damage to destroy (or, at least, to sufficiently mar so as to render him unable to interact).
* He saves as a magic user of level equal to the number of teeth currently in his mouth (i.e., 1st to 16th level).
	* Transmute rock to mud is highly effective against Pol for obvious reasons, although his natural MR 25% gives him a fighting chance against it.
* 13 teeth: magic missile (8x/day, at 16th-level).
* 16 teeth: charm monster, charm person, mass charm, feeblemind, and geas

### SL6-9: North Colossus: Irene Bellatrix

* A 25’ tall, colossal, headless statue of a breastplate-clad female warrior facing west.
	* She gestures with a short javelin towards SL6-10.
	* Its head lies at the bottom of the Drowned Canyon.
	* The pedestal reads as follows (in Mithric):
		* Subjugator and destroyer,
		* Purger with fire and gladius,
		* Irene belied her name 
	* GM Note: The statue represents Irene (meaning ‘peace’ in Greek) Bellatrix, a once-famous warrior-archon who, following in the footsteps of the great Marius, cleaned up the remnants of heqeti activity in most of the middle levels of Arden Vul.
* A thin tripwire is tied to the foot of the statue and runs NNE towards SL6-10.
	* Those approaching the edge of the Drowned Canyon or the stairs at SL6-10 run the risk of tripping on the cord: 4d6 under DEX or trip, with 25% chance of slipping over the edge of the chasm, -5% for each point of DEX over 14, +5% for each point of DEX under 10. Those who trip are automatically surprised by the fishmen lurking at SL6-10.

### SL6-10: Stairs Leading Down into the Canyon

* A narrow (4’-wide) and steep set of stairs is carved into the west end of the cliff.
	* The spray from the waterfall (SL6-1B) makes the steps slippery.
	* They descend 50’, although only the top 30’ are above the water.
		* Where the stairs enter the water (30’ below the cliff edge) drifts a pile of flotsam: wooden planks, mostly rotted canvas, and some bloated corpses of fishmen and lizardmen.
			* The planks could be used to construct a raft.
	* A hunting party of fishmen lurks in ambush at the top of the stairs and along the cliff edge, using holes in the cliff to support themselves below the pavement level.

6 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 24, 22, 20, 18, 16, 15; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club, spear or javelin); MR 10%. Special attacks: paralyzing mucus. Special defenses: immune to cold and poison.

### SL6-11: Natural Cavern, North Side

* Away from the pavement (SL6-6), the floor of the cave is rough (+1x difficult terrain).
	* Every 3 turns wandering here, 25% chance of finding a corpse (2d6; max 18 corpses).

D6 Type
* 1-2 Fishman
* 3 Lizardman 
* 4 Goblin
* 5 Human adventurer
* 6 Specimen of unknown, minor, demon-kind

D6 Condition
* Ancient, stripped of all equipment, and badly decayed 
* Fresh, with 3-60 gp worth of minor valuables or equipment
* Recent, but flensed of all flesh
* Recent, bound and gagged, with a gaping abdominal wound; a member of Leofwin Rufus’s doomed party (see SL5-44 and SL6-16) 
* Ancient, trapped with explosive runes, and carrying a scroll of protection from demons 

### SL6-12: Cave of the Colossal Column 

* Several stalagmites and stalactites have fused together in the northeast corner of this cave, forming a huge column 20’ across and extending 30’ to the ceiling of the cave.
	* Flowstone drifts emerge from SL6-14 and SL6-15, lending an uneven, slippery feel to the cavern floor.
	* A 4’-wide walkway has been carved into the column 15’ up from the floor.
		* It gives a clear view of the approach from the south.
		* A crude wooden ladder rests against the north side of the column; providing access to the walkway.
		* A hollowed-out cylinder (10’ in diameter and 10’ deep) within the column is accessed via a 4’-diameter hole.
			* Inside is a jointed, 20’-long rope-and-wood bridge that can connect the walkway to the lip of  SL6-15. The fishmen use it to access the walkway and their shrine in the neighboring cave.
			* At the bottom of the niche is a frost brand longsword wrapped in chamois cloth.  The fishmen are unaware of it.
*  A party of 6 fishmen occupies this area, alert to activity from the south.
	* They use ranged weapons from the walkway against all comers.
	* All six wear an odd necklace (25 gp) made of bits of coral, bone, smooth glass, and teeth, vaguely resembling a fanged eel’s head, marking their bearers as members of the cult of the eel (see SL6-15).

6 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 24, 22, 20, 18, 16, 15; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club, spear or javelin); MR 10%. Special attacks: paralyzing mucus. Special defenses: immune to cold and poison.

### SL6-13: Cave with Pool

* From a flowstone lip near the entrance to SL6-12, the cavern floor slopes sharply downwards to reach the floor of this cave (5’ differential in height).
	* A pool covers most of the surface area of the cave, leaving only a narrow (3’) ledge around it.
* The pool is shallow (5’-10’ deep) except in its exact center, where a sinkhole leads to a water-filled passage down to SL6-1.
	* The pool is filled with algae, lichen, and blind cave fish.
	* A pod of eight giant frogs make their home in and around the pond.
	* At the bottom of the pool is a skeleton of a long-dead human adventurer.
		* It a spear +2, still-usable elven chain mail, and 2 teeth of Pol (new).
* The fishmen ( SL6-12, SL6-15) do not bother the frogs, considering them kindred spirits.

8 giant frogs: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 30’, 90’ swimming, 100’ jumping; HD 3; HP 24, 23, 23, 22, 21, 21, 20, 19; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4; tongue strikes at +4 to hit; 
swallow on natural 20.

### SL6-14: Empty Cave

* The nearby presence of the fishmen (SL6-12 and SL6-15) and the giant frogs (SL6-13), has kept this cave uninhabited.

### SL6-15: Shrine to the Eel

* This entrance to this cave is 20’ above the main cavern (SL6-12).
	* The fishmen use the hinged bridge stored in the column (SL6-12) to access the cave.
* The cave is floored with ancient flowstone; the entire area drips with moisture.
	* Stumps of numerous stalagmites dot the floor; all shattered or broken off.
	* Only a single, 5'-tall stalagmite still stands in the center of the cave.
		* An odd twist to its top makes it look a bit like an eel with mouth turned to face the opening of the cave.  The fishmen who discovered it have furthered this by carving eyeholes and suggestions of teeth.
		* The eel/stalagmite is draped with their small offerings: skeletal fish, several mummified lizardman hands, a set of dried eyeballs on a string, and some broken javelins.
	* Impaled on a few stalagmite stumps are nasty-smelling, naked corpses (a human male, a lizardman, and an apostate fishman).
	* The northwestern projection has a 15’-deep pool of cold, clear water, where the fishmen cultivate some ordinary moray eels.
* Down the long, narrow northern finger is a secondary shrine, built of a mound of lizardman skulls and a badly tarnished silver tray.
	* Atop of the tray are 6 large lumps of obsidian (25 gp each), a rare black sapphire (5,000 gp) among them, and a 1’-tall jade statuette of an eel (a pledge of Rimmaq-Isfet, new).
* This cave is the home of splinter group of fishmen, known as the cult of the eel.
	* They worship the colossal moray eel (SL6-24) as the true form of Rimmaq-Isfet.
	* They discovered this cave with the unusual stalagmite, they made it their shrine.
	* They placate and adore the great eel here, offering bits of personal ‘treasure’ in hopes of winning the eel’s favor and fending off its attacks.
	* The cult of the eel has not completely abandoned their colleagues in the Flooded Vaults (SL7); but believe they have additional insight into the ways of great Rimmaq-Isfet, which their ‘ordinary’ brethren have yet to appreciate.

7 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 24, 22, 20, 18, 17, 16, 15; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club, spear or javelin); MR 10%.

## Sub-Level 6: 16 - 37  (Upper)

### SL6-16: Tomb of Tiresias the White

* This chamber holds the mortal remains of Tiresias Cornutus, aka “the White”, an imperial wizard in antiquity and secretly an important leader of the Sortians.

* The chamber is 15’ tall, clad in 1’ white tiles with 3” blue Sortian knot in their centers.
	* A black granite ==sarcophagus==, 10’ long and 5’ wide, occupies the center. 
		* Smears of fresh blood mar the white floor just east of the sarcophagus. 
	* At the west end is a ==10’-tall bust== of a distinguished-looking, middle-aged man.
	* Open stone chests stand against the north and south walls.
	* Secret Door (west): tall and narrow (6’x2’), opens pushing the door inward while a tile near the door is pressed.
		* Beyond the door is a narrow corridor that ends in a one-way door to SL6-12.
	* Secret Door (south, aka SL6-A): easy to locate from this side (1-in-4); opens by knocking three times and speaking ‘open’ in Mithric.
* The tomb is occupied at present by a flensing demon named Belubzor.
	* It arrived when a member of the Priscian Order unaffiliated with Nerub Null (9-64) located the tomb forty years ago.  Belubzor slew him and his company, and has waited patiently here ever since. 
	* It clings invisibly to the ceiling and attacks as soon as attention is paid to the sarcophagus. It disposes of flensed bodies outside the secret door (SL6-16a).

Sarcophagus
* 10’ x 5’ x 5' and carved of black granite, with a visible crack for a lid.
	* Incised on the ‘lid’ in silver-filled (25 gp) letters (Mithric): Tiresias Cornutus, styled ‘the White’, soldier in the cause of justice and egalitarianism, lies at rest. He braved the heat put forth by Isadora, companion of his dearest friend, Priscus the Hekate, and welcomed a change in his eternal form. Where in life Tiresias was fiercest champion of the ways of the Sortians, so too in death does he espouse the cause of right and justice.
* The ‘sarcophagus’ is actually a solid block of stone carved to resemble a sarcophagus.
	* It takes a few attempts to discover this, during which the flensing demon will attack.

Huge Bust of Tiresias
* This massive bust (10’ tall, 5’ wide, 3’ deep) is carved of solid marble, and with close attention to every detail.
	* An elderly man, thin to gauntness, nearly bald with unruly tufts of hair by his ears, with narrowed, suspicious eyes and a short, snub nose.
	* The only splash of color on the white marble marble is a heavy chain of gold and lapis rectangles around Tiresias’s neck (1325 gp.
		* Touching the chain causes a magic mouth to speak (Mithric) “Remove me at your peril!”  An empty threat.
		* If the chain is removed, the head clicks open on a hinge, revealing a cavity.
			* Alabaster jar with the ashes of Tiresias the White (50 gp for the jar,  but the ashes could sell to modern Priscians for 575 gp)
			* A complete copy of the ultra-rare Priscian text, the Hidden Codex
			* Tiresias’s ring of free action

Stone Chests
* North: 5,392 ancient gold solidi in neat, but dusty, stacks.
* South: a Sortian baculus (new), a 3-lb lump of arcanum, an ankh of protection (new), gold and sapphire Sortian eyes, and a set of 6 gold goblets with scenes from the life of Priscus Pulcher (200 gp each).

GM Note
* Tiresias the White was a mage attached to the imperial legions, and a trusted advisor to the archon of Arden Vul.  Yet he also was one of Priscus Pulcher’s oldest friends, and came to share the egalitarian ideals of Priscus and the other Sortians.
* Working from within the imperial hierarchy, Tiresias provided valuable intelligence to the Sortians until his actions finally provoked the suspicions of the Drome.
* As a military man, he wished to die honorably rather than be exposed as a traitor, so Isadora, the gold dragon and companion of Priscus Pulcher, agreed to provide him with a suitably dramatic and reputation-saving demise through her blazing dragon-fire.  Other Sortians ensured his burial in this hidden location. 

1 flensing demon (name: Belubzor) (see new monsters): SZ L; AC -1; MV 90’, leap 40’; HD 9+9; HP 76; #AT 4; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-6/1-6; MR 35%. Constant abilities: infravision. Special 
attacks: flensing; leap; mucous spit. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; half damage from cold, electricity, fire, and gas. Special: invisibility; detect invisibility; levitate (1,000 lb); dispel magic; darkness (20’ diameter); ESP; teleport without error; gate (50%).

##### SL6-16a: Corpses and Secret Door 

* The corpses of six human adventurers are piled in front of the secret door, dead ~3 days.
	* The skin of four corpses has been completely flensed from its body, leaving grotesque, sticky, pink masses of rotting flesh.
	* GM Note: These are the comrades of Leofwin Rufus (SL5-44). The adventurers made their way up the spillway from 6-143 to SL6-25 and were ambushed by fishmen investigating SL6-9.   They retreated here after several of their group were slain/driven away. The survivors discovered the secret door to SL6-16, investigated, and were killed by the demon, who deposited their flensed bodies here.
* Secret Door (northeast): cleverly camouflaged to look like the natural cave wall. Opens by knocking three times and speaking ‘open’ (Mithric); otherwise must be forced by strength or magic.

### SL6-17: Cavern of Pol

* This 60’-tall cavern brightly lit from continual light strategically placed along its walls.
	* The Tower of Pol (SL6-17a) is a foreboding, three-story obsidian structure without doors or windows, rising 45’ above the floor of the 60’-tall cavern.
	* North of the tower is a pool of cool, clear, potable water.
	* South is a 5'-wide marble pentagram inset into the stone (identical to SL6-5).
		* This is the primary means by which the castellan of the Tower of Pol enters and leaves it.  One stands on it and casts any arcane spell; instantly the caster and all within 10’ are transported to SL6-5.
	* West is a 10’-deep, 25’-long, 10’-wide pit carved carefully from the bedrock.
	* The floor is natural, but easy to traverse; several paths are visible, including ones between the pentagram and dueling pit, and between pool and dueling pit.

The Challenge
* The cavern of Pol can only be entered by via the tunnel (SL6-18, from 7-135) or the pentagram (SL6-5).
	* Arriving via tunnel provokes no reaction unless a challenge is issued upon the pentagram.
	* Arriving via the pentagram automatically invokes the challenge, and the castellan must immediately appear and duel the new claimant. 
* When challenged, the current castellan – Basil Choumnos – will teleport from the tower in 3 rounds to the south lip of the dueling pit.
	* He immediately issues the formal challenge: “I, Basil Choumnos, am rightful lord of the Tower of Pol. Who challenges my right?” 
	* Intruders have a brief opportunity to explain themselves, during which Basil will explain, imperiously, their choice: either a magic user duels him, or the intruders return back the way they came.  He then repeats his challenge, and the visitor must reply with their name and some form of challenge. 
	* If attacked during negotiations, his obligation to duel ends, and he is teleported back to the Tower; likely to utterly ignore any clamor from outside.   Only if the intruders are particularly annoying and appear weak will he mount to the top of the tower and engage the intruders in combat from that safe location.
* If a duel is agreed upon, the two parties descend into the dueling pit  (10’ x 10’ x 25’).
	* The current castellan then issues this formal invitation to duel: “I, Basil Choumnos, castellan of the Tower of Pol, welcome this chance to demonstrate my lordship. Let the challenge commence!”
	* A half-dome wall of force covers the dueling pit while the two mages do battle.
	* Duels are to the death.  Magic is expected, but, anything goes.  Not a few castellans have gained lordship by clever use of weaponry or other unexpected techniques.
	* When one duelist drops to 0 HP, they are petrified and transported to SL6-5.  The  powers and obligation of the castellan (see SL6-17A) are imposed (or reinforced) in the victor., who is teleported within the Tower.  The wall of force disappears. 

### SL6-17a: Tower of Pol 

* The tower of Pol is a dwelling constructed by one of the great archmages of antiquity, Pol of Archontos.
	* Powerful magics convey potent benefits on the owner (known as the castellan or chatelaine) as well as certain binding obligations.
	* The current castellan is Basil Choumnos, known to his former colleagues as ‘the skin-changer’ for his use of polymorph spells; Basil defeated Gemma of Arcturos thirty-seven years ago and has reigned as lord (with only one challenge) ever since.

Benefits and Obligations of the Castellan
* Possession of the Tower of Pol was highly sought after in antiquity.  It offers great security, wealth and power to its possessor, but also bears heavy obligations. 
	* Benefits: residence in the tower, access to its library and spell-books, great wealth, powerful transportation magic, and the opportunity for near eternal life.
	* By defeating the current castellan, a challenger immediately falls under the effect of several powerful geases.
		* Each day beyond 3 that the castellan is away from the Tower, they lose 1 CON.
		* The castellan is required to duel any challenger.
			* Unless the castellan is in stasis or traveling in another plane, they must immediately activate one of the recall objects and head forth to offer magical combat to the challenger.
		* Only a Wish can end the geas, and the castellan will find themself returned to SL6-5 carrying a maximum of 25 lb of gear.
* If a castellan dies away from the Tower, the next mage to arrive in SL6-17 via the pentagram in SL6-5 finds a key on the pentagram with ‘home’ inscribed on it.  Picking it up and speaking ‘home’ instantly establishes the finder as the new castellan.

Recall Devices
* 3 keys and 3 small stones on leather thongs.
	* Permanently enchanted with Pol’s recall (new)
	* Each key is different opens no lock.  Holding it and speaking "home" teleports you to Level 2 of the Tower of Pol.
	* Holding a rock and speaking "challenge" teleports one to the dueling pit in SL6-17. 

The Tower
* The tower is a foreboding, three-story obsidian structure without doors or windows, rising 45’ above the floor of the 60’-tall cavern.
##### Level 1: Ground Floor

* The ground floor of the tower is for storage and mundane affairs.
	* Scores of boxes, crates, kegs, and other containers hold supplies of dried meat, vegetables, spices, and other cooking materials.

##### Level 2: Living Quarters

* This floor is devoted to living and studying.
	* North: thick woven carpet (45 gp), a pair of stuffed leather chairs, a tripod of heating, and a cabinet stocked with brandy and wine (12 bottles, 10-100 gp each).
	* West: a comfortable bed and an open stone ever-full chest filled with coins (new).
		* 1,789 ancient silver pennies, 371 ancient gold solidi, 4,590 sp, 987 gp

	* Next to it is a chest filled with 24 rudishva lesser power supplies (22 drained) and 3 rudishva greater power supplies (2 drained).
	* The castellans have used the cryogenic chamber to extend their lives.
	* Casually stored in the cryogenic chamber is a soft chamois pouch
		* 40 tourmalines (100 gp each).
* South: a fully stocked magical and alchemical laboratory, with glassware, retorts, mortars, and ingredients worth 7,500 gp.
	* A few potent magic items lie among the lab equipment: an olifant of command (demonic entities), a shrunken head, a greater salt lamp of protection, and an insidious bone flute (new for all).
* On the east, west, southeast, and southwest walls are inscribed permanent gates to distant locations and planes.
	* Astral Plane (east); The City of Brass (west); A forgotten sub-basement in the imperial capital of Archontos (southeast); The top floor of the Tower of Scrutiny (TS-12) (southwest).

##### Roof:

* 6 massive volumes holding all known spells plus the unique spells of Pol (new). 
	* Begun by Pol himself, subsequent castellans have added to the tome.

* If taken from the Tower of Pol, it erases one random spell per day until empty.

### SL6-18: Tunnel down to 7-135

* This tunnel snakes downward before ending at 7-135.

### SL6-19: Damp Ledge with Mosaic 

* This substantial sub-cavern is reached via a ledge 20’ above the floor of the main cavern.
	* It glistens with dampness, and several decomposed corpses are visible from the entranceway.
		* The dampness is a gray ooze of unusual size and potency.
	* A 15’-diameter mosaic in the form of a giant, complex blue knot lies at the west end of the cave.
		* The mosaic is the arrival point for the Sortian face at 6-48 (new).
		* The corpses are the remains of the last three Priscian war mages to attempt to access the Drowned Canyon via the teleporter.

1 enormous gray ooze: SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 10’; HD 5+5; HP 37; #AT 1; Dmg 2-16. Special attacks: corrode metal. Special defenses: impervious to spells; immune to heat and cold. 
* The ooze has consumed all the metallic valuables from the dead Priscians.  Only three light-blue surcoats, a potion of climbing, and three scrolls (water breathing, enchanted weapon, and interposing hand) in a wooden scroll case remain.

### SL6-20: Doors to Nowhere

* A pair of 12’-tall, 20’-wide double doors of black granite looms over the cavern here.
	* Each half has a 3’-tall symbol incised on its surface, filled with crushed, fused lapis.
		* Left symbol: a stylus and piece of parchment
		* Right symbol: a coil of rope surrounding a helmet.
	* The doors are locked (keys long lost) and wizard locked at the 6th-level.
	* They lead to a 10’ space just deep enough for them to open; solid, unworked, stone lies beyond.
		* Smashed into the space behind the left valve is the corpse of an elven mage.
			* 2 teeth of Pol (new); six 100 gp pearls; a snapped, useless magic staff; 
			* A slip of parchment reading “red-black-yellow-blue-green-white” (coordinates to the Thothian ring at SL6-28).

### SL6-21: Secret Door and Trapped Corridor

* The secret door is a circular stone plug (normal to locate).
	* It opens by forcing it inward (as stuck door).
	* Beyond the secret door is a narrow, 6’-wide tunnel leading to SL6-10.
		* A series of traps lies in wait along the tunnel for the unwary.
		* Scything blade: a 10’ section of floor is a pressure plate that causes several blades to scythe across the hallway (3d6 damage to those in its path).
		* Pit with spikes: just beyond the pressure plate for the blades is a 10’ section of floor that gives way to a 10’-deep pit with wooden stakes (2d6 damage).
		* Poisoned darts: the final 10’ of corridor before the door to SL6-22 is a pressure plate that launches a dozen air-powered poison darts (1d2 each and save vs poison at +2 or die).

### SL6-22: Vault of Sulla the Myrmex

* The ‘door’ to this chamber is a solid slab of granite.
	* On it is inscribed (in silver gilt) a skull-and-crossbones and (Mithric): “The Myrmex rests unquietly within. Do not free him, for he knows only destruction.”
	* The slab has no opening mechanism and can bypassed only by magic or hours with a pick and maul.
* The chamber is a simple, roughly smoothed stone vault without decoration.
	* In its center is a 4’-square pedestal; atop it is an oversized torso of carved obsidian.
	* Five 2’-diameter, 5’-tall pedestals dot the walls of the chamber.
		* On each is a different piece of Sulla the Myrmex: 2 legs, 2 arms, and head.
			* Each piece is also of obsidian, with bronze pins, hinges, and other devices to ensure working joints at the elbows, wrists, knees, ankles, and neck.
				* The head is striking, with a permanent half-smile, exaggerated oval eyes, and heavily ringleted hair. 
				* The hands have a fork-like apparatus bound to their outer surface (hence the Myrmex; like beetle mandibles?).
		* Close inspection of any piece reveals a strange smith’s mark.
			* The Dwarven rune (Ptah hieroglyph) for “Quality” connected to the name, “Zhorak.”  Zhorak was a dwarven smith in Arden Vul in antiquity; his forge may be found in the Nether Reaches at 8-100.

Restoring Sulla the Myrmex
* If any piece of the Myrmex touched to its socket on the torso, the two pieces fuse with an ominous ‘clunk’.
* If all five pieces are restored, Sulla the Myrmex rises and begins to wreak destruction.
	* It does not immediately attack humans, but does so relentlessly attacked.
	* It departs its vault and begins systematically destroying:
		* a) all representational statuary (i.e., anything that represents a human or sentient form)
		* b) any architectural feature from the heqeti or rudishva periods.
	* It starts in the Drowned Canyon and moves on to other levels.
		* It cannot detect secret doors, so hidden areas are safe, but will break doors.
		* If not stopped, Sulla inflicts substantial damage on the dungeon itself.

Background
* Sulla is the Myrmex (new monster), a unique construct created by Zhorak the Smith, a dwarven smith whose long career spanned much of the era of the Archontean hegemony.
* In addition to use against the heqeti, the archons used Sulla to demolish unwanted structures.

Sulla the Myrmex (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 4; MV 60’; HD 16; HP 70; #AT 2; Dmg 3-24/3-24; MR special. Special attacks: slow 10' radius once per 3 rds; clenched fists 1/turn. Special 
defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to cold and fire; cured by electricity; immune to all spells except stone to flesh (3d6 dmg, 75% chance a limb falls off).

* Limbs: focuses on rejoining any "severed" limbs (1 rounds to get and 1 to attach).

### SL6-23: Ledge Overlooking Canyon

* A ledge has been carved into the south side of this massive stone pillar, 50’ above the floor of the cavern (SL6-11), with an excellent view of the Drowned Cavern.
	* The north side of the ledge is worked stone, with a fine bas-relief of an archaic Archontean infantryman spearing an amphibian-oid creature.
	* The ledge is dusty and empty save for two 50’ coils of silk rope.
* Secret Door (north): easy to find (1 in 4), and opens easily by pushing inward. 

##### SL6-23a: Hidden Chamber 

* This chamber is completely hidden within the massive pillar that rises on the north side of the Drowned Canyon.
	* Accessible via the secret door (SL6-23) amd by the long, vertical tube within the pillar that leads down to SL6-51.
* The interior is badly damaged, with shreds of painted plaster hanging from the walls and ceiling.
	* A jagged, 5’ hole in the pavement provides access (75' above the floor) to SL6-51.
	* Two sarcophagi and a funerary shrine crowd the chamber.
		* The sarcophagi are plain and undecorated, originally holding the bodies of senior Archontean military commanders.
		* Their lids are shattered, and treasure scattered around the chamber.
			* 433 ancient silver pennies, 387 ancient gold solidi.
			* A platinum model of an archaic legionary fortress (1,150 gp)
			* A spear +2, +3 versus golems, light crossbow of accuracy
			* A piece of obsidian carved (Mithric) with: “The construct known as Sulla had to be dismantled, for in the absence of the (Ptah) dwarven smith, he has proven uncontrollable. The military sorcerers of the XIth Legion were required to dismantle it with spells of transmutation” (refers to Sulla the Myrmex, whose remains lie in SL6-22).
* Hiding behind the northern sarcophagus are 3 wights, ready to attack.

3 wights: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 4+3; HP 33, 29, 27; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic needed to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### SL6-24: The Drowned Canyon

* The dominant feature of this level, the Drowned Canyon is one of the iconic locations within Arden Vul.
	* The canyon proper is east of the waterfall (SL6-1B) and west of the dam (SL6-25). 
	* It is 180’ deep towards the western end, though the floor slopes upward at its eastern end.
		* In antiquity the dam and water level were lower than now.  When Reiv-Tor began to dominate the Flooded Vaults (SL7-23), he had his minions build up the dam with chitinous ‘coral’, thus raising the water level substantially.
	* Presently the water level is 30’ below the level of the waterfall and 45’ below the level of the cave floor (SL6-11 and SL6-30).
	* A moderate current moves from west to east.
	* The canyon is home to numerous schools of fish, as well as freshwater crustaceans and algae.
* The Drowned Canyon is iconic because in the late, decadent period, the archons of Arden Vul preferred to construct tombs for themselves along the walls of the canyon.
	* The openings to these tombs line the canyon walls; due to the rise in water level, many tombs are now partly or wholly underwater.

* The dominant figure in the canyon is a highly aggressive colossal moray eel.
	* Despite being regularly eaten by the eel, the fishmen from the Flooded Vaults (SL-7) venerate it as a creature of Rimmaq-Isfet.  One sect has even erected a shrine to the eel (SL6-15).
	* The lizardmen (SL-5) fish here regularly, and regard the eel as a nightmare.
	* The eel is alerted to the presence of explorers by noise and motion.
		* After 2 rounds of combat in or near the water, 75% chance per subsequent round the eel is drawn to the sound and to attack if possible.
		* If the PCs spend a turn swimming or diving in the canyon, the eel has a 50% chance per subsequent round to investigate.
		* Quiet rowing on the surface have a 25% chance per turn after the first two turns that the eel comes to investigate.
		* Falling over the waterfall (SL6-1B) has a 66% chance of attracting the eel.
* Treasure has accumulated on the floor of the canyon over the centuries.
	* The head of the statue Irene Bellatrix (SL6-9) also rests on the canyon floor. 
	* A 12’-tall, bronze statue of a generic archon, pointing with a baculus (650 gp)
	* A set of wax tablets wrapped in oilcloth (Mithric)
		* “The Twins honored Arden Vul by choosing it for their resting place.  The least we can do is ensure that prying eyes do not discover their tomb.  Redouble your efforts to conceal its true location”
			* (GM: refers to SL6-86 to SL6-88)
	* A slightly rusty suit of cursed imperial field plate of vulnerability (av items)
	* A shield +1, +4 vs. missiles
	* A marble sarcophagus lid with a high-relief carving of an Archontean lady (250 gp)
	* A tarnished silver casket (55 gp) holding a set of matched platinum and emerald jewelry (earrings, necklace, and ring; 9500 gp).

Colossal moray eel (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’ swimming; HD 9; HP 68; #AT 1; Dmg 4-24.

### SL6-25: Dam, and Spillway to 6-143

* Originally the water from the drowned canyon flowed naturally across the dam into the spillway, meaning the water level was much lower than today.
	* The lower water level allowed access to the tomb openings along the canyon walls.
* Reiv-Tor (SL7-23) arrived in SL-7 and wished to flood it entirely, so he ordered his fishmen to raise the height of the dam.
	* They did so using chitinous exoskeletal bits and bio-engineered adhesives. 
	* Rising 40’ above the spillway, the new dam makes has flooded or partially flooded many tomb entrances and created a secondary waterfall from the dammed canyon into the spillway. 
* The spillway is about 40’ wide, 4’ tall, and semicircular; its circular walls are natural stone, but the flat floor is smooth, worked granite. 
	* From the dam it proceeds east before turning northeast, eventually reaching the Great Chasm at 6-6A. 
	* The pitch of the spillway is gentle, only about 20-degrees. 
	* There is a breach in the spillway roof after the turn to the northeast (see 6-152). 

Destroying the Dam
* Clever explorers might attempt to destroy the dam, reducing the water level and rendering the tomb openings easier to access. 
	* The dam is sturdy, requiring 60 HP of damage with picks, mauls and shovels to breach the dam (AC 2).  There is a 1% cumulative chance for each additional HP of damage inflicted that it will collapse in a roar of water and chitinous material.
		* Those on or near the dam when it breaches are likely swept down the spillway and into the chasm to their doom.
	* Earthquake, disintegrate, etc will breach the dam in a matter of rounds, and a water or earth elemental could also breach the dam. 
	* Noisy attempts to destroy the dam bring all nearby fishmen and the colossal moray eel to the attack, and an emergency force of 24 fishmen arrives from the Flooded Vaults within 1-3 turns to investigate.

* Eliminating the dam has serious consequences for several levels and sub-levels:
	* Level 9: in the short term, a much greater volume of water than is normal will course down the spillway and into the chasm, tremendously increasing the volume and force of the waterfall.
		* Affects 9-1, 9-4, 9-7 to 9-10, 9-65, 9-73, 9-83, 9-87, 9-127, 9-135, 9-136, 9-142.
	* SL-6: the new waterline of the Drowned Canyon (SL6-24) is 85’-90’ below the level of the cavern floor.
		* All the tomb entrances (SL6-25, SL6-26, SL6-27, SL6-35, SL6-36, SL6-37, SL6-44, SL6-45, SL6-53, SL6-54, SL6-67, SL6-68, SL6-77, SL6-78, and SL6-79) are now above water, and many tombs will empty of water.
		* Descending stairs and slopes in some areas will retain their water (e.g. SL6-47).
	* SL-7 (the Flooded Vaults): significant area of this level will empty of water. The activity and mobility of the fishmen and of Reiv-Tor (SL7-23) will be curtailed.

### SL6-26: Sunken Area and Tunnel Down to 7-86

* This section of floor slopes downward. forming a concave depression about 10’ below the main level of the floor.
	* A large purple pudding (new) inhabits the area.
	* Unlike the natural cavern floor, this area appears to be a slagged mixture of stone, metal struts and rods, and fragments of plasteel. None have recognizable forms, nor are they easily separated from the stone to which they have been fused. 
	* The southeastern corner of the depression has a hole in the cavern wall leading to a tunnel that descending precipitously to 7-86.

1 large purple pudding (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 10; HP 69; #AT 1; Dmg 2-12. Special attacks: corrosive to metal and leather. Special defenses: immune to fire; 
grows with electricity; conductive.

### SL6-27: Rudishva Pagoda

* A 10’-tall granite platform rises from the cavern floor; topped by a 15’-tall stone canopy supported by six basalt columns.
	* Each column is carved in a sinuous style depicting floral and animal patterns.
	* The granite floor of the platform is also carved in elaborate leaves, stems, and bizarre creatures.
		* The central 10’x10’ section actually covers a hole in the structure (can be pried up (open doors) with a lever). Beneath is a 10’x10’x10’ chamber carved out of the granite; empty, but an excellent hiding place.
	* At the rear of the platform, flush with the cavern wall, is a 15’-tall, carved ivory screen, in the same elaborate style (15,000 gp, but very difficult to move).
		* In the center it depicts a multi-lobed object composed of several roughly oval pods; a ramp descends from one of the ramps (the Beacon).

### SL6-28: Archontean Parvis and Teleportation Ring

* The cobblestones are here covered with thirteen white marble slabs some 3” thick.
	* Many are cracked and buckled, with the usual heqeti cobblestones are beneath, see SL6-35).
* To the southeast is a Thothian teleportation ring (address: RE-BK-YE-BL-GR-WH).
	* No glass activation squares are present.

### SL6-29: Archimedean Screw

* Here, at the edge of the Drowned Canyon, the Archonteans built a massive Archimedean screw of copper, descending 75’.
	* It is operated by turning a copper handle on the upper end; after about 100 rotations, water starts to emerge at the top.
	* One could clamber down the screw casing (2d8 under DEX) and access to SL6-81).
		* The return ascent is more difficult (roll 3d8 under STR).

### SL6-30: Natural Cavern, South Side

* Away from the pavement (SL6-35) the cavern floor is rough (+3x difficult terrain).
	* Every 3 turns roaming the natural area, 25% chance to encounter something from the table below (in addition to normal encounter checks).

### SL6-31: Hidden Chamber within Rock Formation, with Stairs Down

* A wide (10’ x 10’) secret door is set into the side of this rock formation, 30’ above the cavern floor.
	* It opens by picking a locking mechanism or forcing (open doors), but there is no ledge on which to stand.
* Within is a chamber carved out of the middle of the rock formation.
	* At its rear is a spiral staircase leading down to SL6-89.
	* The walls contain 8’-tall mosaics depicting specific individuals, each identified by a caption in Mithric.
		* East wall

			* Clavius Tekton, a young-looking man dressed in a lemon-yellow tunic displaying a pair of dividers as he steps casually on a stone block.
		* GM: these are all Archontean emperors of the glory period of Arden Vul.
	* A 10’-diameter mosaic is set in the floor: a lemon-yellow hoplite helmet around which a black serpent is coiled (one of the primary symbols of the empire).
		* Stepping on the mosaic causes a magic mouth to speak (Mithric): “By command of the emperor Clavius Tekton you are forbidden further passage! Retire now!”.  An invisible stalker is summoned and commanded to eliminate the interloper (the first to step on the mosaic).  These happen only once each.

1 invisible stalker: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 55; #AT 1; Dmg 4-16; MR 30%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-5. Special defenses: invisibility.

### SL6-32: Pool of the Black Pillars

* Here at the south side of the cavern is a broad, shallow pool of murky brown water. 
	* Projecting from the water are two 3’-diameter pillars formed of black hematite.
		* Each is incised with a stanza of silvery Glyphik (same words on each).
			* Scudding clouds in the pink skies of Tethrek

			* If 2 rudishva identity plaques are placed simultaneously into the indentations, holograms appear in the space between the pillars.
				* It cycles (15 seconds each) through the four sites mentioned in the verse listed above, then the Drowned Canyon itself.
					* Gas giant clouds, distant mega-lightning, titanic flying ray-whales.
					* Geysers of magma shooting from an impossible cliffside, two dim red suns shining above.
					* Immense buoyant fungal "trees" tethered by thin vine-trunks, blue-green mists swirling between.
					* The vivid nebulae of the claw cluster.

### SL6-33: Stairs Down into the Drowned Canyon

* A narrow (4’) set of very steep stairs descends 50’ into the Drowned Canyon.
	* The final 20’ are under the surface of the water.
	* The steps are slippery from the spray of the falls (SL6-1B).
	* A long smear of blood and mangled viscera coats the middle section of the stairs (no body is present, however). 
* As at area SL6-10, some flotsam has accumulated here, where the stairs enter the water.
	* 3 waterlogged planks, a wooden desk top, and some wooden shelves.
	* One might make a crude but serviceable raft from the debris. 

### SL6-34: South Colossus: Tardif the Sage

* This colossal statue, 25’ tall and facing west, depicts in neo-realist style a toga-clad, sandaled human man.
	* He sports an old-fashioned philosopher’s beard, stroking it with his right hand.  A garland of oak leaves surrounds his head.  With his left hand, he points a stylus towards the geyser.
* The pedestal reads (Mithric):
	* Font of justice and counsel,
	* Lyrical poet in composition and governing,
	* Tardif shone with sophia 
* GM Note: Tardif the Sage was archon of Arden Vul during the glory years of peace and prosperity after Marius’s conquests. He was known as a scholar, poet, playwright, and wise judge.

### SL6-35: Cobblestoned Pavement, South

* Like its counterpart on the north side, a pavement made of irregularly sized cobblestones  (~3' x 2') dry-fitted together covers the cavern floor here, 
	* The pavement rises 5’ above the natural floor, accessed via two short flights of stairs.
	* It dates to the heqeti period.
	* Under each of the ~1,600 cobblestones is a 1’-square cavity in the rock.

### SL6-36: Corridor to SL5-47

* The cobblestones end just within the mouth of this corridor, which wends south to SL5-47 in the lizardman caves.
	* Littered with trash, including numerous broken arrows of a primitive nature.
* 25% chance a war party of 10 lizardmen is lurking within the entrance to the corridor.

10 lizardmen (25%): SZ M; AL N; AC 4; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 2+1; HP 15, 13, 13, 12, 12, 11, 11, 10, 9, 9; #AT 1 or 3; Dmg 1-6 (club) and 1-6 (javelin), or 1-2/1-2/1-8. Possessions: clubs; javelins; shields.

### SL6-37: Fiery Wall and Stairs Up to 5-115

* A set of worn stone stairs leads up 300’ to 5-115, covered in inches of undisturbed dust.
	* A rudishva fiery force wall cowls the stairwell on all sides (including above); broken only by an 8’-tall, 4’-wide oval in which a holographic figure stands on one leg.
		* The figure has two legs and six arms, holding a drum, pot of fire, lotus, and dagger; the other two hands empty.
		* It is possible to catch a glimpse of the stairs through the aperture.
		* If a being approaches within 5’, the figure starts to dance slowly, swiftly increasing its tempo. After 3 rounds, it begin hurling blobs of fire from the fiery force wall (unerring, 1d6 damage, chance to ignite combustibles).
		* The force wall can only be destroyed by disintegration.
		* An orange or silver rudishva identity plaque causes the figure to dematerialize, allowing passage through the oval opening. After a turn, the dancer reappears.

## Sub-Level 6: 38 - 45 (Lower North)

### SL6-38: Archway and Stairs (Submerged)

* This 10’-tall arched entrance to Archontean-era tombs lies 60’ below the level of cavern floor and 20’ below the water level of the Drowned Canyon.
	* The archway leads to stairs rising 20’ to exit the water before a sodden, moisture-filled wooden door (stuck).
		* Three hand axes are buried in the door, and the skeleton of a dwarf in a badly rent chain hauberk (AC 6) lies in front of it.
			* Battle axe; a pouch (50 gp of wet silver dust), a silver flute (25 gp).

### SL6-39: Grand Porch and Corridor to SL7-1 (Submerged)

* This semi-circular porch extends into the Drowned Canyon and in antiquity afforded a fine prospect of the canyon proper.
	* Now 80’ below the floor of the cavern, and 35’ below water.
	* 3 slim porphyry pillars line the opening to a 10’-tall, 20’-wide corridor proceeding 200’ north to SL7-1.
	* Sediment has accumulated, a once-grand mosaic is visible beneath the grime.
		* It shows two figures, a warrior woman and a cowled sorcerer, standing on either side of a lemon-yellow hoplite helmet around which a serpent is coiled.
			* GM Note: Arden and Vul; the helmet is one of the imperial symbols.
* 50% chance that 6 fishmen are lurking just behind the porphyry pillars, waiting for their moment to avoid the colossal moray eel (see SL6-24) and swim for the stairs at SL6-10.

6 fishmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL CE; AC 5; MV 60’, 150’ swimming; HD 3+1; HP 24, 22, 20, 18, 16, 15; #AT 2 or 1; Dmg 1-3/1-3 or 2-7 (bone club or javelin); MR 10%. Special attacks: paralyzing mucus. Special defenses: immune to cold, poison.

### SL6-40: Hallway (Submerged)

* A 10’-tall archway leads to a long hallway.
	* This is 60’ below the cavern floor and 20’ below the water level, thus flooded. 
	* The hallway is dark and murky, with several inches of sediment on the floor.
		* A dozen human-sized, webbed, footprints could be spotted in the sediment.

### SL6-41: Archway and Stairs (Submerged)

	* The archway leads to a set of stairs rising 20’ to exit the water before a sodden, moisture-filled wooden door (stuck).

### SL6-42: Tomb of Zoferus Felix (Dry)

* Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

* Due to the stairs at SL6-38, this tomb lies above the current waterline of the canyon.
	* Still, it is damp and humid, and patches of spectacular (but benign) red, green, and purple mold have destroyed all of the former wall decorations.
	* A section of ==false living mosaic== (new) exists on the west wall.
		* Secret Door (west): 3’ wide and 7’ tall, concealed within the mosaic. Opens by pressing the mosaic sarcophagus.
	* A 10’x5’x5’ marble ==sarcophagus== stands in the center of the chamber. 
	* Secret Door (east, locked, key lost): 4’ tall and 3’ wide, obscured by a particularly vibrant patch of orange mold.  Accesses a 4’ square corridor leading east to SL6-43. 
		* If approached from SL6-43, easy to locate (1 in 4) and opens by pressing a stud in the cramped corridor, causing the door to spring inward.

False living mosaic
* The section on the west wall is 3’ wide and 7’ tall.
* Depicts 24 tiny legionaries marching down the wall, from top to bottom, towards a rectangular sarcophagus.
	* If watched, the legionaries gather around the sarcophagus and attempt to open it with spears and crowbars.
* If any living being approaches within 5’ of the mosaic, two of the tiny legionaries turn towards the viewer and hurl two tiny darts out of the mosaic and into the viewer’s eyes (save versus poison) permanently blinded in both eyes.
	* Made to work 12 times, 7 remain.
	* Can be disabled by dispel magic or neutralize poison.
* The secret door to SL6-48 opens by pressing the mosaic sarcophagus.

Sarcophagus
* The sarcophagus is carved on all sides in a half-round style (750 lbs, 250 gp).
	* Long side: toga-clad Archonteans gathering around a burial pyre for a great warrior (Marius Tricotor, 6-154).
	* Long side: legionaries spearing bipedal salamanders.
	* Short side: a toga-clad man holding a bundle of fasces in one arm, pointing to a pair of large doors with his other hand
	* Short side: the same toga-clad man sitting in a seat of justice, pointing with a baculus at some disputants.
		* The man on the short sides is Zoferus Felix, one of the archons of Arden Vul during its glory years.
* Zoferus Felix’s tomb was looted in antiquity. The lid is gone (at the bottom of the drowned canyon), and all that remains are some bones and bits of moldy linen. 

### SL6-43: Tomb of Halfenius Scriptor (Dry)

* Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

* Although above the waterline, this tomb is damp and humid; smears of paint are all that remain of the formerly opulent wall decorations.
	* A plain basalt sarcophagus (10’ x 5’ x 5’) lies in the center of the chamber.
		* The lid of the sarcophagus lies shattered on the floor.
			* Its inscription (Mithric) “Halfenius Scriptor, Archon of Arden Vul, Recorder of Great Deeds”.
		* Inside is the complete, disaggregated skeleton of Archon Halfenius Scriptor.
	* Several piles of rotted wood suggest the remains of furniture.
		* A former bookshelf conceals a carefully wrapped oilskin package containing two slim codices.
			* #1) 3 spells: Basil’s torch treatment, the Bracteros effect and Pol’s endless sneezes (new)
			* #2) The Lay of Marius Invictus and the Deeds of Marius (books), both written by Lucius Cornelius Scriptor (6-135).
	* A hole in the pavement leads 10’ down to the ceiling of SL6-13.
		* Half of the hole is filled with water, as is the entirety of area SL6-44.
		* There is the glint of gold amid the silt of the floor beneath the hole. 
	* Secret Door (west, locked, key lost): 4’ tall and 3’ wide.  Easy (1 in 4) to locate, as the frescoes that helped conceal it are gone.
		* Accesses a 4’ square corridor west towards SL6-42.
		* Approached from the west (SL6-42), easy to locate (1 in 4) and opens by pressing a button in the cramped corridor, causing the door to spring inward.

### SL6-44: Tomb of Irene Bellatrix (Submerged)

* The door is stuck open at a 45-degree angle.
	* There is a gleam of gold (13 ancient gold solidi) amid the silt on the floor, visible from the doorway or the hole leading up to SL6-43.
* This tomb is fully underwater and murky due to layers of silt.
	* North wall: a three-quarters round carving of a crossed gladius and wand.
		* There is a secret compartment in the stone wand; opened by inserting a ½”-diameter object into a hidden hole, causing the base of the stone wand to break open, revealing an enchanted rod (of lordly might) within.
	* The floor is littered with fragments of a stone sarcophagus (of one of the famous archons of Arden Vul, see SL6-9).
	* A 5’-diameter hole in the ceiling leads up 10’ to SL6-43.
* The tomb is now occupied by a shoal of quippers which ventures into the canyon a couple of times a day.

43 quippers: SZ S; AL N; AC 8; MV 90’ swimming; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4(x10), 3(x11), 2(x11), 1(x11); #AT 1; Dmg 1-2. Special: only 75% chance to attack initially; blood in the water causes frenzy.

### SL6-45: Tomb of Cassandra Rubea (Submerged)

* The door to this, the oldest of the tombs in the canyon, is stone, and in good condition.
	* It is magically sealed (12th-level wizard lock) and thus the tomb chamber is currently dry.  Opening the door causes water to rush in (d6 to those sucked with it), flooding the chamber floods dirty, murky water in 1 round.
* The 15’-tall chamber is the resting place of Casasandra Rubea.
	* She was one of the first great archons of Arden Vul and a predecessor of the iconic Marius Tricotor (6-154).  An expansionist, she first claimed the Drowned Canyon.
	* The walls are covered in archaic frescoes depicting Cassandra Rubea and her staff.
		* East: in in military garb, she shouts at legionaries and slaps them with the flat of her gladius.
		* West: she sits in an old-school seat of justice (a camp chair), dressed in toga with olive wreath, but with reddened face and gritted teeth.
		* Southwest: she gestures at a cave in which a geyser and river are prominent (i.e., the drowned canyon)
		* Southeast: red-faced, she berates a set of impassive courtiers standing in front of a large horned skeleton bound in chains (a giant rudishva skeleton).
	* In the ==chamber center are two 8’-tall marble statues== of Cassandra Rubea
	* A ==sarcophagus== (10’x5’x5’) rests on a triangular dais against the north wall.
	* Four more 8’-tall statues of archaically dressed Archontean legionaries occupy the northwest, southwest, northeast, and southeast corners of the chamber.
		* Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (new), that animate if the sarcophagus puzzle is mishandled.  Unhindered if underwater.

==Center-West Statue==
* Shows Cassandra as a solid woman dressed in legionary garb, with breastplate, greaves, and hoplite helmet.  Mouth open and eyes narrowed, she gestures with a gladius towards her sarcophagus.
* South face of plinth (Mithric): “Cassandra Rubea, scourge of the strong, prop to the weak. With her firm hand, the imperial standard of Basileus Drusirrus was planted among the upper precincts of the abandoned catacombs.”
* North face of plinth (Mithric): “Vice may be a virtue.” (a clue)

==Center-East Statue==
* Shows Cassandra Rubea in leathers, equipped with a traveler’s staff and pouch, consulting a map; the statue’s face is again twisted in a grimace of irritation.
* South face of plinth (Mithric): “The archon led the way in discovering new sources of the mystical stone.  She followed the ancient path to the Canyon, which she claimed for Archontos.”
* North face of plinth (Mithric): “The reddened tolerate no injustice.” (a clue)

==Sarcophagus of Cassandra Rubea==
* A beautiful piece of marble craftsmanship, placed on a 3’-tall triangular dais.
* The sides depict Cassandra Rubea leading groups of legionaries against varumani, huge, horned skeletons (giant rudishva skeletons), and heqeti.
* The lid is enchanted to open if its ==puzzle== is solved correctly.
	* Fifteen square indentations are chiseled into the marble lid (4” x 4”, 1” deep), arranged in 3 rows (first ‘row’ has 1 square, the next two have 7 squares each).
	* Carved ivory plaques rest in the two rows of 7 indentations; each depicting a human in a different scene.
		* The plaques represent the traditional Seven Virtues and Seven Vices of the Archontean Empire.
* Inside Cassandra’s tomb
	* 3 yellow feldspar jars: one with Cassandra’s ashes, one with her mummified heart, and one with her mummified brain.  A hoplite helmet inscribed on each jar with silver gilt (750+ gp to an upper imperial official).
	* Packed in wax:
		* 1,000 mint ancient silver pennies
		* A packet of love letters between Cassandra Rubea and the basileus, Drusirrus the Legionary (1,000 gp and instant notoriety and scandal throughout the empire)
		* A 3’x5’ silk rug depicting Larel and the Wolves (450 gp)
		* A useful palm of repelling (3 charges, new)
		* 2 rings of friendly defense (new). 

==Puzzle==
* The tomb is opened by placing one of the 14 ivory plaques and placing it into the single square above the two rows (the plaque representing ‘anger’).
	* Clues to this fact lie in the infamously irascible personality of Cassandra Rubea, a fact glimpsed both on wall frescoes and on the short inscriptions on the north sides of the statues’ plinths.
* Each time a wrong plaque is placed in the solitary indentation, one of the animated spearmen (see new monsters) lumbers to the attack.
	* After the 4 animated spearmen are destroyed, wrong plaques cause 2d6 lightning to the person handling the plaques, and 1d6 to everyone else in the tomb.
	* When the correct plaque (anger, a female pulling at her hair and gnashing her teeth) is placed, a palpable click is heard and the tomb can now be opened (open doors).

Archontean Virtues and Vices
* In traditional Archontean moral philosophy, there were 7 cardinal virtues, each with a complementary cardinal vice.

* Prudence/Rashness
	* A farmer plows his field while another lies lazily under a tree
	* A legionary rushing ahead of his unit 
* Justice/Pride
	* A seated woman gesturing to two disputants kneeling before her
	* A rider falling froma horse
* Patience/Anger
	* A benignly smiling man walks through a crowd of clamoring petitioners
	* A female pulling at her hair and gnashing her teeth
* Courage/Treason
	* A lone legionary confronts a troll
	* Two men embracing, with one preparingto stab the other with a dagger
* Probity/Lust
	* A man and woman touch hands in the traditional marriage gesture
	* A naked female with toads attached to breasts and genitals
* Vigor/Sloth
	* A man digging with a shovel
	* A fat man leaning against a donkey
* Largesse/Avarice
	* A woman handing an apple to a beggar and a gladius to a man
	* A man sitting on a money chest

4 Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 45, 40, 35, 33; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.

## Sub-Level 6: 46 - 64 (Lower North)

### SL6-46: Tomb of Georgius Aurellus (Submerged)

* The door to this completely submerged chamber is forced half-open.
* Inside, the water is dark with suspended silt, and the chamber is bare save for a pair of intact stone ==sarcophagi== (8’x4’x5’).
* Four giant groupers (new) lurk here in the murk.
* Secret Door (west): 4’ tall by 3’ wide, easy to spot due to centuries of water damage (1 in 4).  Must be forced open.
	* Beyond, a narrow staircase rises out of the water.

Sarcophagi
* The two sarcophagi contain the remains of the archon, Georgius Aurellus, and his favorite concubine, Jellida the Lithe.
	* Georgius: blue granite, its lid carved (Mithric): “Georgius Aurellus, greatest archon of Arden Vul. architect of a comprehensible future, powerful lord, stern master.”
		* Beneath the inscription is a low-relief carving of a thickset man in legionary garb, pointing a gladius toward the west.
		* Inside: a set of platinum and begemmed regalia in the forms of a miniature spear, a circlet, a ring, and a small tablet (2,500 gp); a collar of servitude (new) attached to a fine silver chain (25 gp); a set of 12 1’-tall dancing houris (new).
	* Jellida: blue granite, its lid carved (Mithric): “Faithful Jellida, called the Lithe, served well. Her reward was to accompany her master.”
		* Incised below is an image of a naked woman.
		* Inside: a set of remarkable jewelry made of jade, ivory, and gold, including three toe rings (400 gp each), an anklet (975 gp), four bracelets (850 gp each), three rings (525 gp each), and a torc (1,875 gp); a wax-sealed stone jar (3 cones of incense of attraction, new); a wax-sealed stone jar (an ebony case filled with exotic spices, powders, and unguents, now dried, but capable of rehydration, 495 gp for the box and contents).

Opening Georgius First
* His spirit emerges and moans, “Do not touch my faithful Jellida! You shall be punished if you do.”
	* If Jellida’s tomb is left undisturbed, the spirit does nothing and it will be possible to freely loot Georgius’s tomb.
	* If Jellida’s tomb is subsequently opened, Georgius’s spirit transforms into a vengeful spirit (new) and attacks.

Opening Jellida First
* Her spirit emerges and whispers, “I am now freed. Thank you. But I warn you, do not free that pig. He is greedy and selfish and should be left to lie.” Her spirit departs and her belongings are fair game.
* If Georgius’s sarcophagus is opened after Jellida’s, Georgius emerges immediately as a vengeful spirit and attacks. 

4 giant grouper fish (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’ swimming; HD 5; HP 37, 33, 29, 23; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: surprise on 3 in 6; swallow prey.

Georgius Aurellus, vengeful spirit (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 1; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 38; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: STR drain. Special defenses: +1 or better 
weapons to hit; immune to fire; turned as vampire; reform in 1-6 hours so long as his bones remain disturbed.

### SL6-47: Tomb of Ligareus of Archontos (Dry)

* Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed.
* The door is stone with a golden seal 2’ across the middle.
	* The seal features a hoplite helmet encasing the letters A and V [for Arden Vul].
	* If pried at, the seal explodes for 3d6 within a 10’ radius.
	* Underneath the seal is a keyhole (key long gone).
* The interior of this tomb is pristine, with walls plastered sky-blue and brightly lit by continual light on the ceiling, undisturbed for over 1,900 years.
	* Three low, semicircular ==daises== line the walls.
	* A granite block (==the tomb==) (10’ x 6’ x 5’) stands in the center of the room.
	* A fine layer of maize-colored dust or sand is spread evenly across the floor (although not on the daises or tomb).
		* If visitors enter, the yellow dust coalesces in 2 rounds into a large dust monster (new) that immediately attacks.

The Three Daises
* Each dais holds a fragment of a special living mosaic.
	* If touched, the person is drawn to that location, appearing in the mosaic.
	* They depict:
		* West: a pile of rubble overlooked by a pyramid.
			* The ruined governor’s palace (AV-29) in the city ruins (appear 20' up, 3d6 under DEX or take 2d6 from falling).
		* North: a vast hall forested with columns carved as writhing serpents.  66% chance to see robed human figures passing among the columns.
			* The New Audience Hall in the imperial palace of Archontos.
		* East: a tall hall with many doors, the upper levels spanned by a delicate bridge. Statues of ibises line the bridge. 50% chance to see beastmen patrolling.
			* The Great Hall of Thoth (3-123). Arrivals appear at the north end.

The Tomb
* This apprently seamless granite block is the burial place of Ligareus of Archontos.
* It boasts an inscription (Mithric) and a 2”-diameter holes on each of the five visible sides.
	* Inserting an imperial baculus (rod of authority) or any other 2”-diameter stick into a hole causes an effect.
	* Top: "Ligareus of Archontos, archon of Arden Vul, sorcerer of renown, humble servant of the basileus, rests here"
		* Effect: a spirit image of Ligareus appears and urges visitors in Mithric to take pity on the son of hard-working people and let him lie in peace
	* North: an image of a marketplace, with several stalls showing merchants flogging their wares. Close inspection shows a man, woman, and young boy standing in front of a fish stall
		* Effect: the entire block slides west, revealing a shallow pit holding the mummified remains of Ligareus along his ==grave goods==.
	* East: an image of a sorcerer pointing his wand at a two troll-like beings
		* Effect: two bestial varumani appear and attack
	* South: an image of an imperial functionary scrutinizing the work of masons who are preparing pavements. Close inspection shows the pavement to be mosaic
		* Effect: magical compulsion strikes the wielder of the baculus.  They become obsessed with finding new examples of living mosaic. Remove curse cancels the obsession.
	* West: an elderly archon sits in a chair, while a horde of women and children of various ages crowd happily around him
		* Effect: the spirit of Ligareus appears and recites a simple, heartfelt poem (Mithric):
			* When the night grows near /
			* Victories are not to be counted /
			* Nor is wisdom to be tallied /
			* For a willing spouse /
			* and the fruit of one’s loins /
			* are all that is needed /
			* to stoke the fires /
			* Of the coldest hearts.

Grave Goods
* A staff of power (8 charges)
* Ligareus’s baculus of authority, a silver rod with a still-potent lump of arcanum (new) at its head (475 gp)
* A well-preserved set of Ligareus’s bones wrapped in silk (100 gp for the silk)
* A tarnished bronze tablet listing three generations of Ligareus’s ancestors (all fishmongers, 10 sp, up to 5,000 gp to political forces within the Empire)
* A gold ceremonial hoplite helmet (500 gp)

GM Notes
* Ligareus is remembered for three things:
	* Inventing living mosaics
	* Serving as archon of Arden Vul in the century after Marius 
	* Being the originator of the Ligareon clan
		* Commonly known, but the proud current Ligareon have forgotten (or consciously obscured) the humble origins of Ligareus as the son of fishmongers.
		* Evidence of this would be extremely valuable to the rivals of the Ligareon, especially to the Xenarcheon; proof (the bones and relics of Ligareus) would command up to 5,000 gp from either clan.

1 dust monster (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 0; MV 90’; HD 8, HP 39; #AT 1; Dmg 3-18. Special attacks: suffocation; blinding. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half 
damage from blunt magical weapons.

 2 bestial varumani (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 8; HP 50, 49; #AT 3; Dmg 3-6/3-6/3-10. Special defenses: regenerate 3 HP/rd; infravision; immune to poison.

### SL6-48: Unfinished Side-Tomb (Dry)

* Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed.
* The door is stone with a golden seal 2’ across the middle.
	* The seal features a hoplite helmet encasing the letters A and V [for Arden Vul].
	* If pried at, the seal explodes for 3d6 within a 10’ radius.
	* Underneath the seal is a keyhole (key long gone).
* The interior of the tomb is unfinished; only rough-hewn features and undecorated walls.
	* A pair of skeletons (mistakenly entombed workers) lies on the floor alongside a pick, a maul, and a shovel.

### SL6-49: Tunnel Entrance (Submerged)

* This rough hole in the natural canyon wall, never finished, doesn't lead to a tomb proper.
	* The tunnel is 8’ tall and 6’ wide; sloping downward subtly.
	* The entrance is 85’ below the floor of the cavern (SL6-11) and 40’ below the water, and thus is flooded. 

### SL6-50: Tunnel Entrance (Submerged)

* Another unfinished tomb entrance, this rough tunnel is 6’ tall and 5’ wide, and rises quickly and steeply towards the west.
	* By the time the tunnel turns north, it has risen 20’ and become clear of water.

### SL6-51: Cylindrical Cave (dry), with access to SL6-23A

* This cave is a cylinder, about 25’ in diameter, but 75’ tall.
	* In its ceiling is a hole leading to SL6-23a.
	* A pair of tomb robbers lies dead on the floor of the cave.
		* No wounds, except unnaturally twisted limbs and crushed bones from falling.
		* They wear ancient clothing and equipment; their corpses are 1,500 years old.
			* A suit of chain mail; a helm of underwater action; a pouch with three aquamarines (525 gp each); 53 ancient copper and 71 ancient silver; a staff; four broken potion bottles, one surviving potion of extra healing; and an archon’s baculus, in the form of a solid silver rod, 2” in diameter and 3’ long, with a lump of arcanum (new) soldered to its head (475 gp).

### SL6-52: Cave (Dry)

* In the ceiling of this cave is a 5’-diameter hole that leads up to SL6-64.
	* The floor of this cave is quite unstable due to water erosion below.
		* Those breaking through the floor must roll 4d6 under DEX or drop 10’-30’ into a sub-cave.  Those falling from SL6-64 take normal falling damage, then roll 6d6 under DEX to avoid breaking through this floor and continuing to fall.

### SL6-53: Large Cave (Submerged)

* The passage from SL6-49 slopes downward steeply before ending in this large, 50’-tall, flooded cave.
	* Home of a pack of lacedons, usually lurking in the upper portion of the cave, ready to swoop down on any who enter from north or south.
	* The numerous bones of explorers line its floor.
		* Many turns to search the mulch, bones, and debris for scattered treasure. 
		* 3 suits of rusty chain mail; a dozen rusted and pitted weapons (swords, maces, daggers); 431 ancient silver pennies, 579 ancient gold solidi; 137 sp, 173 gp; a ring of water breathing (new); a rod of turning (new) wrapped in oilskin and silk; a pair of 2’-tall obsidian statuettes of rudishva, adorned with chips of precious and semi-precious stones (450 gp each).

sleep and charm.

### SL6-54: Large Cave (dry)

* Although the floor of this cave lies below the waterline, a rise in the tunnel running between SL6-50 and SL6-54 ensures that its floor remains dry.
	* Numerous stalagmites and stalactites dot the chamber, making movement slow.
	* Two ravenous ropers lurk among the rock formations.

2 ropers: SZ L; AL CE; AC 0; MV 30’; HD 11; HP 77, 68; #AT 1; Dmg 5-20; MR 80%. Special attacks: six poisonous strands (20’-50’ range; reduce STR by 50% in 1-3 rds). Special defenses: immune to lightning; take half damage from cold.
* In the gut of one of the ropers are 9 gemstones: 2 pieces of amber (100 gp each), 2 violet garnets (500 gp each), 2 moss agates (13 gp each), 2 tourmalines (100 gp), and a white opal (1000 gp).

### SL6-55: Archontean Vault (Submerged)

* This Archontean vault for the storage of valuable and dangerous objects has been lost to common knowledge for centuries.
	* The chamber, 18’ tall and flooded with murky water, has no right angles, in imitation of the rudishva style.
	* The vault is built around a massive lump of arcanum, a ragged centerpiece 8’ tall, 7’ wide, and 5’ long (treat as a natural pocket of arcanum for effect on spell-casters).
	* ==6 pedestals== (4’ tall, 3’ across) of polished granite stand against the east and west walls (3 at each side), with ==large stone chests== between each pair of pedestals.
		* There is a bronze display tripod atop each, and an inscription (Mithric) on base.
		* Three chests are locked, one has been opened.
	* Above the objects that line the west wall is inscribed (Mithric): “Let us learn from our predecessors, who discovered Arcanum and were mighty sorcerers. We must venerate, not exterminate, the rudishva!”
* An imperial stone guardian (see new monsters) stands by the wall, west of the north entrance.
	* It animates when anything in the chamber is touched (a lost command word once allowed safe access). 
	* Remains of a shattered second guardian are scattered across the floor.

Pedestals (clockwise, from SW)
* Pedestal #1 (west side): one bracelet from a pair of rudishva communication bracelets (tech; the other is at 6-117). Inscription: “Rudishva Artifact”.
* Pedestal #2 (west side): holds nothing. Inscription: ‘the Tablet of the Beacon’; added graffiti reads “...when it is recovered from the command chamber on the chasm floor.”
	* GM Note: the Tablet of the Beacon (tech) is in 9-107.
* Pedestal #3 (west side): a large skull, with pronounced incisors and two small horns, filled with molten silver (150 gp). Inscription: “Rudishva”.
* Pedestal #4 (east side): an empty rudishva lesser power supply (tech). Inscription: ‘Source of Rudishva Power.’
* Pedestal #5 (east side): a severely damaged rudishva laser pistol (tech) missing its firing tip (explodes if used, 4d6 within 15’).  Inscription: “Do not touch! Dangerous Weaponry.”
	* 4d6 under INT to recognize the damage to the pistol. 
* Pedestal #6 (east side): a malfunctioning GnuCoder 3000 data recorder.  Inscription: “Rudishva sorcery.”
	* One button is painted bright yellow; if pressed, it displays the "Do Your Part!" data crystal (books) as a 3’x5’, 2D holograph. Otherwise, the GnuCoder is inoperative.

Stone Chests 
* Chest #1 (bt/w Pedestals #1 and #2): open and empty; its lid shattered on the floor.
* Chest #2 (b/tw pedestals #2 and #3): 12 fist-sized lumps of arcanum.
* Chest #3 (b/tw pedestals #4 and #5): 6 rudishva lesser power supplies, 2 rudishva breathers, a rudishva laser pistol, and a rudishva sonic fence (tech).

1 imperial stone guardian (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 60; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

##### SL6-55a: Stairs Up to Level 5 (5-42)

* This passage climbs out of the water via two brief stairs.
* A longer set of stairs climbs 300’ to the bronze doors of 5-42.
	* The bronze doors are impossible to open from this side, except by Knock (8th-level or better).

### SL6-56: Tunnel leading to 6-166

* Starting fully submerged, this tunnel rises swiftly after 50’ and becomes dry.
* Beyond this, the tunnel slopes down again, still dry, ultimately leading to 6-166.

### SL6-57: Tunnel Entrance (Submerged)

* This 10’-tall rough-carved tunnel is 65’ below the floor of the cavern, and descends in a gentle slope towards SL6-59.
	* The colossal eel (SL6-24) often lurks in this tunnel, hoping for prey to pass by. If not encountered in the open water of the Drowned Canyon, it will be found here.

Colossal moray eel (see new monsters): stats at SL6-24

### SL6-58: Tomb Entrance (Partly-Submerged)

* This 10’x10’ opening in the canyon wall is located 50’ below the cavern floor.
	* The water level is 45’ below the cavern floor, so this opening is half-submerged (about 5' deep) and half open to the air.

### SL6-59: Empty Tomb of Hesekion the Red-Handed (Submerged) 

* This tomb was prepared for the notorious Hesekion the Red-Handed, archon during the last centuries of the Archontean domination in Arden Vul. 
	* Hesekion had the tomb prepared as an adjunct to the famed Tombs of the Archons (SL6-63), but was arrested for his crimes and taken to Archontos for punishment.  His tomb was thus never used.
* The empty chamber was originally only accessible from SL6-61, but ancient tomb robbers delved the tunnel at SL6-57 and broke into it.
	* The walls show no signs of decoration, and there is nothing on the floor save the tools of the tomb-robbers, namely some ancient pick-axes, hammers, and chisels.
* The bones of a few of the eel’s victims have ended up here, along with a bit of treasure.
	* A suit of blood-red leather armor +2 
	* Red-band, a scimitar +2 (INT 13; empathy, True Neutral, detect sloping passages in a 10’ radius, detect elevator/shifting walls/rooms in a 10’ radius; ego 4)
	* A pair of copper armbands chased with silver (145 gp each)
	* A leather purse with 57 gp; a silk pouch with gold choker (1,400 gp)
	* A pair of ordinary long swords
	* A potion of healing
	* A pair of bracers of archery (greater). 

### SL6-60: Hall of the Archons (Partly-Submerged)

* Like the entrance corridor (SL6-58), this 15’-tall chamber is flooded 5’ deep (-1 attack and damage, difficult terain).
	* A hint of the formerly vibrant painted walls is now smears of wet color running down the walls and statues.
	* Four statues (9’ tall) in the corners of the room depict generalized figures of ancient archons (actually Archontean animated constructs - spearman ).
		* A male archon in toga, gesturing with a baculus.
		* A female archon in legionary armor.
		* A seated archon pointing with a baculus (e.g., justice).
		* An archon in court dress, with circlet and rod of authority.
	* Double doors stand between each pair of statues.
		* The doors are false; if opened, the statues animate and attack.
	* A chiseled inscription in 2'-high letters (Mithric) occupies the northeast wall.
		* It had gold filling but was scraped clean (5 gp left) by previous robbers. 
		* “From on high the Basileus looks with approval on the deeds of his archons. They have earned their rest.”
			* GM Note: ‘on high’ is a clue to the trapdoor in the ceiling
	* A secret 5' square trapdoor in the ceiling leads to SL6-63.
		* Opens by pushing (open doors) a stone square up and into the narrow (5' diameter), rough-carved corridor above.

4 Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters), in the form of archons: SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 45, 38, 35, 33; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons.

### SL6-61: Antechamber (Dry)

* This 10’-tall chamber was originally the antechamber to the now-looted tomb at SL6-59.
	* The stairs south drain water, so it is currently dry, and preserves some of its original decoration.
	* Six 8’-tall figures in high relief line the walls of the chamber.
		* Each is the same figure, an archon in toga, cradling a baculus of authority with arms crossed, mouths open in command.
	* 15’-diameter circular mosaic is inlaid in the floor showing a blue hoplite helmet on a lemon yellow field.
		* If touched, spectres emerges from the mouths of three of the wall reliefs (2 half-strength, 1 full).  Any new spectres remain bound here to the mouths.
	* Secret Door (west): easy (1 in 4) to find, opens by pulling a slab inward (open doors).

1 spectre: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 7+3; HP 52; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis

2 half-strength spectres: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 3+3; HP 26, 24; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### SL6-62: Treasure Chamber (Dry)

* This 8’-tall chamber is rough-carved and plain.
	* Four 4’-square by 4’-tall, open stone bins stand in the middle of the room.
		* Bin #1: 5,439 ancient silver pennies
		* Bin #2: 3,467 ancient gold solidi
		* Bin #3: 1,111 white pearls (100 gp each) and one giant pearl (5,000 gp).
		* Bin#4: empty
	* An iron bar is set in the north wall; from it hangs an ivory horn of domination (new).
	* Secret Door (east): opens by pushing a stone slab towards the east (open doors).

### SL6-63: Tombs of the Archons (Dry)

* This 15’-tall, secret chamber houses the sarcophagi of six ancient archons of Arden Vul.
	* It hasn’t been visited since Hesekion the Red-Handed (SL6-59) had his tomb dug in 1556 AEP.
	* Six elaborate marble ==sarcophagi== stand in two rows.
		* The top of each is carved with an image of its inhabitant, and the side is inscribed (Mithric).
	* A 2’-tall, gold-filled ==inscription== (Mithric) occupies the north wall.
	* A 10’-tall statue of the Archontean basileus (emperor) presides from the north wall.
		* Painted in lifelike, bright colors, and draped in the formal, high-collared robe of the emperor, wearing the traditional fluted cylindrical headdress of office, the emperor holds forth his right hand, inviting beseechers to kiss it. With the left hand he points to the center of the room.
			* The emperor’s extended hand has subtle wear marks on the ring finger. 
		* On the pediment is carved “Clavius made me”
			* GM Note: Clavius Yellow-Born, emperor from 1191-1204 AEP, under whose rule the majority of this chamber was planned and executed.
		* Secret Trapdoor (floor): the statue covers the trapdoor.
			* Solve the puzzle and the statue grinds aside, revealing a 5’-wide hole into the tunnel to SL6-62.

Sarcophagi
* From southwest to southeast:
	* Sarcophagus #1: Kallidan Ill-Counseled
		* Image: A male archon in toga, wearing a circlet and cradling a baculus in both hands. He wears a silver ring (left hand) (25 gp).

* But woe befalls they who his command fail. 
* 
* ???
* Fear is not theirs, who his wishes fulfill,
* But fail his command and woe he instills.

* A clue to the puzzle to access to the trap door leading to SL6-62.
	* A gold ring from the right hand of one of the archons must be placed on the basileus’s extended hand.  The statue will grind left, revealing the hole to SL6-62.
	* The ring of Quirinus the Factor (gold ring, on the right hand) is needed.
	* Each time that the wrong ring is placed on the basileus’s hand, a sheet of fire sweeps forth from his hand, inflicting 6d6 on all in the chamber (save for half).

### SL6-64: Side Cave with Hole down to SL6-52 (Dry)

* This 4’ diameter, dry tunnel leads to a dead-end with a hole in the floor down to SL6-52.

## Sub-Level 6: 65 - 75 (Lower South)

### SL6-65: Corridor Entrance (Submerged)

* A 10’-tall arched corridor of worked, but undecorated, granite leads inward towards the catacombs of the Archontean curial class.
	* It is 30’ below the water level, and a flight of steps leads upward immediately inside the entrance.

### SL6-66: Corridor Entrance (Submerged)

An 8’-tall square corridor leads southwest from this point; the corridor is 30’ below the water line. A trapped iron grillwork blocks the corridor 10’ from the entrance. The grillwork can be 
opened with a successfully lift gates roll. The skeletal corpse of an ancient tomb robber lies on the floor before the grillwork. 

Trap (electricity): The grillwork has a warding chain of glyphs (electricity) spell cast upon it (see new spells). Originally there were seven glyphs inscribed on the grillwork, but over the centuries the first four have been activated, leaving only the last three (per the spell description these inflict 5d6, 6d6 and 7d6 damage respectively). Since the glyph is the one for electricity, and since the grillwork is submerged, it will affect all those in a 50’ radius from the grillwork and not just the one who touches the glyph.

Treasure:
The tomb robber’s tattered clothing is archaic. It bears a dagger, a sodden and rotted staff, and a pouch in which are 45 gp, 8 pp, and small silver statuette (2” tall) of an archon with the name “Vafer the Telator, archon” inscribed on the base (145 gp). 

GM Note: Players may inquire about the meaning of ‘telator’. The word in Mithric was unusual, an archaic, obscure term even when Mithric was the common language; it meant ‘web-spinner’, with the connotation of ‘plotter’. Certain PCs might have a chance of knowing this obscure meaning. Those PCs familiar with Mithric must roll 6d4 under INT to recognize this ancient term. 

### SL6-67: Antechamber with Tombs (Submerged)

This undecorated antechamber to the complex built by Vafer Telator is filled with murky water. Three carved stone sarcaphagi (8’x4’x4’) occupy its center. The sarcophagi can be opened regularly, but also constitute a puzzle. The south wall carries an inscription in Mithric: “Search not for Lord Vafer. The spinner-of-webs has departed towards the spillway.” GM Note: this inscription is designed to throw off tomb-robbers searching for Lord Vafer’s 
tomb (SL6-69).

Sarcophagi
The three are identically sized (8’x4’x4’), with lids containing gisants on them. The lids may be removed with an open doors check, revealing some mediocre contents. Clever PCs may recognize that the gisants and inscriptions are part of a puzzle. All three sarcophagi detect as magic.

Sarcophagus 1
Gisant: A middle-aged man, dressed in the robes of a bureaucrat and holding a stylus and writing tablet. 
Initial Orientation: The head of the man is towards the southwest.
Inscription (in Mithric) above Head: “logoTHete and chartouLArios of diSTInction”.
Contents: A bundle of bones inside badly-decomposed linen wraps, a platinum stylus (75 gp), numerous ruined sheets of parchment, and one soggy but still usable scroll of protection from elementals.

Sarcophagus 2
Gisant: An aged man, dressed in a toga and cradling both the fasces of authority and the archon’s baculus.
Initial Orientation: The head of the man is towards the southwest.Inscription (in Mithric) above Head: “archON and friENd of the imperaTOR”.
Contents: A complete skeleton, with a violet garnet (500 gp) inside the skull; a set of silver fasces wrapped in gold thread (100 gp, but up to 2,500 gp to an imperial collector).

Sarcophagus 3 
Gisant: A young boy, dressed in a tunic and holding a toy sword.
Initial Orientation: The head of the boy is towards the northeast.
Inscription (in Mithric) above Head: “suiTEd for DOMination at an eARly age”.
Contents: the skeleton of a 10-year old boy, plus a worm-ridden wooden sword.

Puzzle: The puzzle involves arranging the lids in the correct order and then touching the letters that spell TELATOR (Vafer’s nickname). Once this is accomplished, the secret door to SL6-68 pops open. Solving the puzzle depends on several factors. First, PCs must first realize that the lids are interchangeable, and can be shifted from sarcophagus to sarcophagus. Second, they must also realize that orientation matters, that is, that the heads of the gisants must be placed towards the northeast (and not towards the southwest). A clue to this fact is found on the inscription on the south wall (the spillway lies towards the northeast). Third, 
they must realize that the correct order of lids is boy-man-old man. Finally, they must recognize that the strange capitalization scheme found in the inscriptions is significant. Each inscription has three sets of capitalized letters. Once the lids are arranged in proper chronological order, it is possible to spell out TELATOR by looking at the first, second, and third set of capitalized letters on each gisant (respectively). That is, the first set of capitalized letters on the ‘boy’ gisant is TE; the second set of capitalized letters on the gisant with the middle-aged man is LA; and the third set of capitalized letters on the gisant with the old man is TOR. A clue to the significance of ‘telator’ is found on the corpse in SL6-66.

Secret Door (northeast): The door is normal to locate. Only the key found in the hidden compartment of the sarcophagus at SL6-68 can open it. Attempts to pick the lock have only a flat 5% chance to succeed.

Secret Door (Southwest): This door is easy to locate (1 in 4), as the water from the canyon has revealed its outline. Only by solving the puzzle of the three sarcophagi can it be opened. 

### SL6-68: False Tomb of Vafer Telator (Submerged)

This chamber is home to the false tomb of the Archon Vafer Telator, and includes a nasty trap/curse. The walls were originally cerulean blue, with large gold-colored hoplite helmets scattered across the blue field. The blue paint has faded and dissolved over time, leaving a few patches of blue and the approximately 20 burnished gold-gilt images of helmets (15 gp each if scraped off). A faded inscription in Mithric can barely be made out on the south wall; it reads, “Lord Vafer was most unwise. All he touched turned to gold, and he found he could not eat gold. Ponder this and take heed lest you suffer his fate! Only a kind patriarch can reverse his fate.”

A pair of stone statues of kneeling, loincloth-clad bearers crouches on both the east and the west wall; these statues face the sarcophagus and are shaped such that the hands of each of the four seem to be holding a stick, or the pole of a sedan chair. While no poles are present, a standard 1”- or 2”-diameter pole could fit easily into their hands. Close examination of the debris in the chamber might reveal some splintered and rotted fragments of wooden poles. As described below, the statues are enchanted and can be used to help raise the lid of the sarcophagus. 

Sarcophagus: The marble sarcophagus is massive, some 20’ long, 6’ wide, and 5’ tall. An image of a recumbent Vafer Telator is carved out of the lid; the archon is dressed in his toga and sandals, and grips his fasces and baculus of authority. He appears as a thin, elderly man with a pinched face, narrowed eyes, and clenched teeth. Inspection of the sides of the sarcophagus reveal carved imperial symbols, including hoplite helmets, large elaborate keys, and dragons. Closer inspection reveals two round holes, 2” in diameter, on each side. These holes line up exactly with the (missing) poles held by the bearer statues along the walls. Should four 5’-long, 1-” or 2”-diameter poles be inserted into the bearers’ hands, they could 
be slotted easily into the holes on the sarcophagus sides. Once four poles have been fitted in this way, the stone statues stand up via magic and lift the lid of the sarcophagus with them. This is the only way to access the interior of the sarcophagus.

Within is a smaller space, about 8’x4’x4’ in size. The (false) corpse of Vafer Telator lies within, wrapped in linen bandages with a single boney finger protruding from midway down the corpse. What is disconcerting, however, is that the corpse – body, linen wraps, finger – is solid gold and cursed (see below). Only by extreme care – gloves, or careful use of ropes – can Vafer’s body be removed without incurring the curse. 

Curse: The false Vafer’s body is afflicted with the Midas Curse. Should any living flesh touch the (false) corpse, that flesh and all objects touching it are instantly turned into gold. Touching a non-living object to the body has no effect; only living flesh triggers transforming effect. Those turned to gold by Vafer remain true gold for only 1-8 days; after the 1-8 days have passed, the ‘gold’ reverts to a gold-colored stone. During the period in which Vafer’s 
victims are made of true gold, the curse is also ‘contagious,’ such that victims can also transform other living flesh into gold (again, for 1-8 days). The curse can only be removed by a 12th-level (or better), good-aligned cleric who casts remove curse on the original corpse (Vafer’s false corpse). If this is done, Vafer’s body remains solid gold but loses the curse (and can thus be used as wealth), and all victims still within the 1-8-day window revert to normal flesh. If the remove curse is cast after the expiration of the 1-8-day window, victims remain stone (but can be restored via a stone to flesh spell).

Hidden Compartment (sarcophagus): Beneath the cursed golden corpse of Vafer Telator is a secret compartment, 2” square. It is difficult to detect passively (1 in 8), but normal to detect if the interior of the sarcophagus is searched carefully (once the golden corpse has been removed). Within the compartment is a golden skeleton-type key whose tooth is shaped like a tiny ankh. This key operates the secret door (northeast) in SL6-67 that leads to Vafer’s true tomb (SL6-69).

Treasure:
Should remove curse be cast at a high enough level on the solid gold corpse, the gold loses its curse and can be chopped up, or sold as is. It is extremely heavy. The golden body weighs 400 lb and is worth 25,000 gp intact; the broken into pieces it is worth 20,000 gp.

### SL6-69: True Tomb of Vafer Telator (Submerged)

The true tomb of the archon, Vafer Telator, lies hidden in this chamber. The entire chamber - walls, floor, and ceiling - is covered in tarnished gold leaf, (total of 435 gp). Two stone chests stand against the north wall, while Vafer Telator –now a fearsome (if soggy) mummy- himself stands upright in the center of the chamber amid the murky water. 

Secret Door (southwest): This door is easy to detect if approaching from SL6-69. It is locked and almost impossible to open (5% flat chance to pick the lock) without the key, which is found in SL6-68.

Secret Door (east, into SL6-70): This door is easy (1 in 4) to detect if approaching it from SL6-69. It can be pulled open from that side with an open doors check.

Vafer Telator, a mummy: SZ M; AL LE; AC 3; MV 60’; HD 6+3; HP 48; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12. Special attacks: fear; rotting disease. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from magic weapons; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis; turned as a vampire due to the special pin he wears. Since Vafer is submerged, he risks no danger from fire.

Treasure:
Chest #1: 10,000 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), plus a solid gold archon’s baculus (250 gp, but 2,500 gp to an imperial collector)

Chest #2: a shield +2, a hammer +2, guantlets of ogre power, and a rust-colored bag of tricks
Corpse of Vafer Telator: the mummy wears a lesser necklace of prayer beads (same as the usual, except that special beads can only be used once) and a gold pin shaped like a hoplite 
helmet. The pin – a symbol of imperial authority – causes Vafer to be turned as a vampire. Destroying the pin grants 1,000 experience points to a good character.

### SL6-70: Burial Niches (Submerged)

This 10’-tall corridor is lined with niches in which the lesser officials of the Archontean civil administration were buried during the period when the Canyon was used as a burial site. Most of these officials were scribes, chartoularii, lesser logothetes, protonotarii, and so forth. Because the entrance to this area was open to direct access for a long time, almost all of these niches were broken open and plundered in antiquity. As a result, the corridor currently is littered with piles of broken stone burial plugs, minor bits of iron and steel, and masses of bones. Long strips of linen shrouds hang lazily in the murky water. 

Careful and time-consuming searching through the rubble and the numerous empty niches reveals a few valuables left behind by the plunderers. One item may be found per turn of searching (up to 8 items). Determine items using this table:

### SL6-71: Shattered Tomb with Fish (Submerged)

* A broken sarcophagus lies in this chamber.
	* Someone in the past systematically destroyed the chamber.
		* The walls are chipped and pitted (with only a few patches of remaining paint), all identifying marks on the sarcophagus have been purposefully obliterated.
	* The torn and gnawed corpses of nine fishmen and lizardmen float at the top of the chamber; two skeletons of ancient tomb robbers lie on the floor.
		* A suit of chain mail, a bent, but still usable staff +1, assorted coins worth 254 sp and 119 gp, a pair of gold bracelets (150 gp for the pair).

2 giant pikes: SZ L; AL N: AC 5; MV 360’ swimming; HD 4; HP 26, 22; #AT 1; Dmg 4-16. Special attacks surprise on 4 in 6. 

### SL6-72: Burial Niches (Dry)

Note: The air supply in this area is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

* This corridor is filled with plundered and broken burial niches, as in SL6-70.
	* Searching produces one item from the table in SL6-70 every turn (up to 8 items).

### SL6-73: Shattered Tomb (Dry)

Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

* This once-elegant tomb has been systematically plundered by looters.
	* As with SL6-71, all reference to the original sarcophagus owner has been obliterated.
	* Frescoes of toga-clad imperial officers remain, but all faces have been erased.

### SL6-74: Lower Chamber (Dry)

Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

An ominous sight greets visitors to this 30’x30’x10’ chamber. A bullet-shaped basalt monument stands in the exact center of the room; scattered around it are eight moldering corpses. The corpses appear to have been flung backward, although each has an outstretched hand that seems to be reaching towards the monument. All surfaces – walls, ceiling, and even the floor - are plastered and painted lemon yellow; while mold and damp has damaged the plaster in some spots, it is remarkably well-preserved. An inscription in Mithric has been carved into the south wall and filled with silver (50 gp); it reads “Heroes of the Empire look down on you from above. Duty, Loyalty, and Respect are your obligations.” [GM Note: this inscription is a clue to the operation of the mechanism for opening the way to SL6-77; see SL6-76 for more details]

Skeletons: The eight come from various periods. Four appear ancient, two are lizardmen, and two are fishmen. None of the remains appear to bear any injury, nor do any of them animate. The skeletons have been stripped of all valuables.

Deadly Monument: The bullet-shaped monument is formed of sickly grey granite and is 3’ in diameter and 6’ tall. It detects as magic and as evil. A stream of arcane glyphs has been painted across the monument in a bone-white paint; the glyphs swirl across the monument’s surface in three large whorls. Those with the ability to view the glyphs from a distance (i.e., magically) will notice that there are fifty-eight distinct glyphs. Such viewers might also notice 
eight blank spots in the stream (where glyphs previously existed).

It takes advanced knowledge of magical theory to recognize that each of the glyph represents the concept of death from a different linguistic, planar, or cultural perspective. Practically speaking, magic users of 7th-level and above have a chance to recognize the nature of the glyphs: the chance is 30% plus 5% per additional experience level.

Each glyph carries a deadly enchantment: if any living creature approaches within 10’ of the monument, the next glyph in the stream discharges in a burst of magical power while a deep 
voice intones the word ‘death’ in Mithric. All those within 15’ of the monument who possess 60 HP or less are instantly slain (those with more than 60 HP take 60 HP damage). Victims are permitted a save versus death magic (with a -2 penalty); if the save is made, the victim merely takes 30 HP damage.

Each time a glyph activates, it is erased from the monument; as a result, the monument only has fifty-eight more uses. It is possible to mask the power of the monument, at least temporarily: casting dispel magic on the monument (by a caster of at least 7th-level dampens the power of the monument for 1-3 turns. Such should be sufficient to allow a swift party to climb through the concealed hole in the ceiling.

Concealed Hole: The plastered ceiling conceals a 10’x10’ hole that leads up a 5’-long tunnel to SL6-75. PCs have normal chances to detect this concealed ‘door’. Once detected, it is easy to break through the plaster to reveal the hole.

### SL6-75: Upper Chamber (Dry)

Notes: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above. It also lies beyond the walls of the main cavern of the Drowned Canyon, a fact which means that the floor level relative to the cavern floor is no longer relevant.

This enormous chamber has 20’-tall walls and a pyramidal ceiling that rises another 10’. Four colossal statues stand in the corners of the room facing its center. Stirring inscriptions in 
Mithric appear on three of the four walls. A 10’x10’ hole in floor leads down 5’ to the plaster ceiling of SL6-74. A 3’ parapet surrounds the hole.

Statues: All four of the 12’ statues are of legionaries at parade rest. They detect of magic, but do not animate until/unless the relics from SL6-77 are brought into this chamber. At that point they lumber to life and prepare to destroy the desecrators.

Inscriptions: Three of the walls feature a word incised into the stone in 2’-tall capital letters. They read as follows:
 North: Respect
 East: Duty
 West: Loyalty

4 imperial stone guardians (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 60, 60, 60, 57; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

## Sub-Level 6: 76 - 98 (Lower South)

### SL6-76: Hall of Imperial Heroes (Dry)

Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

This 30’-tall, barrel-vaulted hall offers an impressive tribute to some long-forgotten military heroes of antiquity. A 10’-wide strip of red onyx has been inset into the granite; it leads from the entrance to the main statue at the south end of the hall. Flanking the red stone walkway are eight 15’-tall statues. An inscription (actually a song) runs along the wall at a point 20’ above the floor; it starts in the northwest corner and ends in the northeast corner. The words of the Mithric inscription are 2’ tall, inset into the stone, and inlaid with more red onyx. At the south end of the hall stands a 20’-tall statue of the great Archontean hero, Spiculus Carbo.

Statues of Lesser Heroes: The eight statues depict men and women in military garb, albeit in clothing and equipment unique to each individual. Each stands on a low plinth on which the name of the hero is inscribed. The statues are enchanted (and detect as magic). Should any one of the three code words embedded in the song inscription (duty, loyalty, respect) be touched (see below), all eight break out into a rough version of the song, chanted in loud bass tones. Should the physical remains of Spiculus Carbo be looted from SL6-77, the eight offer boos, hisses, and raspberries in equally loud tones. From southwest to southeast, the statues depict:
28. Hertulion, in legionary gear, in a defensive posture with shield and spear
29. Janata (F), in scout garb, wielding a sling
30. Hjaltion, a dekarch, gesturing with baculus
31. Terencius Borsa, as a legionary thrusting with short sword
32. Eadgifia (F), polemarch with shield raised, thrusting with spear
33. Lauret (F), archer nocking an arrow in her short bow
34. Isketius the Black, as a legionary crouching behind his shield
35. Marcus the Elephant, in a loincloth holding a club

Statue of Spiculus Carbo: This basalt statue is enormous, rising 20’ above the floor. Spiculus Carbo, a long-forgotten hero of the ancient Archontean empire, is dressed in battered field plate, and leans wearily on his spear. The heads of two heqeti hoppers lie at his feet. The plinth carries this inscription: “Spiculus Carbo, scutarius, who embodied the three virtues of his calling in falling for his comrades during the great war against the Hoppers.”

Inscription/Song:  The words (in Mithric) of the song are as follows (N.B.: the three code words are underlined here for the GM’s purposes alone; nothing on the wall distinguishes these words from the others):

Hail to the heroes, whose deeds are clear to all
None of them stepped back, when duty made its call
Amid the press and without doubt they formed the sacred wall
And there with blades a-flashing, they saw the enemy fall
Through loyalty fierce and honor clear they forced the foe in thrall 
Their deeds of noble service demand respect from all

GM Note: This was a popular marching song of the legions during the period of Archon Marius Tricotor. There is a slim chance that a PC with a military background may recognize some of the phrases from modern military practice.

Secret passage (to SL6-77): It is almost impossible (1 in 12) to detect that there is a hidden passageway under the statue of Spiculus Carbo. It is revealed when the three code words (clues to which may be found in the inscriptions in SL6-74 and SL6-75) are touched, in any order and within 5 minutes. At that point the statue slides forward, revealing the stairs and hidden passage.

### SL6-77: Secret Tomb of Spiculus Carbo (Dry)

Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

This hidden chamber houses the remains of Spiculus Carbo, as well as some relics associated with him. A stone table stands in the center of the 8’-tall, rough-carved chamber. An armor rack stands behind it. 

Table: The physical remains of Spiculus Carbo sit on the table. 

These include the skull, femurs, and one skeletal hand, as well as an alabaster jar filled with ashes (the rest of his remains). The bones have been coated with molten gold and gleam dully; they are worth 125 gp but if associated with any of Carbo’s gear might bring 875 gp. Alas, if any of the remains (bones or ashes) are brought into SL6-75, the four imperial stone guardians there immediately attack.  Next to the remains are Spiculus’s hoplite helmet, to which is attached a pair of fox pelts, his gladius, a silver cloak pin, and a pair of worn sandals. The helmet is normal, but the fox pelts are enchanted (fox crests – see new magic items), as are the sandals (sandals of agility – see new magic items).

Armor Rack: The rack holds Spiculus Carbo’s extremely battered suit of imperial field plate (see Arden Vul items), as well as his spear +3. Due to its age and condition, the armor requires 450 gp worth of repair work for peak functionality; until such work is completed, it provides AC 4 (instead of the normal AC 2).

### SL6-78: Tomb of Licata the Archer (Dry)

Note: the air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

The earthly remains of a second hero of the Archontean wars versus the heqeti may be found here. The chamber is 20’ tall, and the walls are painted a bright lemon-yellow color. Three 10’-tall statues of female archers with nocked arrows stand in the north, east, and south corners. Licata’s remains rest on a stone table in the center of the chamber. 

Trap (pressure plate and magical arrows): A pressure plate occupies the 10’x10’ square just inside the entranceway. For each medium-sized creature that crosses the plate, there is a 75% chance that the trap triggers. Once triggered, each of the stone statues releases two magical arrows per round at randomly determined targets. For purposes of rolling to hit, the archers have 8 HD; each arrow inflicts 2-8 HP damage. The arrows strike any object existing within a plane defined as between 3’ and 10’ above the floor; those lying prone, and/or those who can levitate/fly to a point 10’ above the floor, are immune from the arrow fire. Dispel magic cast on one of the statues immediately stops arrow fire from that statue.

Table: The stone table contains the remains of Licata the archer: a skull, with two huge red spinels (350 gp each) set into its eye sockets, a set of finger bones wired together, and a cedar box containing her ashes. The box is inlaid with silver, and carries the image of a coiled bowstring (the insignia of the I Velites legion) and the name ‘Licata the dekarch’. If the box is opened, it releases Licata’s spirit, now a terrible spectre.

Also on the table are the following: a heavy gold signet ring that reads ‘Licata’ and ‘Loyalty’ (350 gp); her long bow +2; a quiver of 20 arrows +2; and a beautiful opal and jade necklace 
(2,250 gp).

Licata the spectre: SZ M; AL LE; AC 2; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 7+3; HP 52; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### SL6-79: Unfinished Tomb (Dry)

Note: The air supply in this chamber is fixed; see general sub-level conditions above.

The door to this chamber is locked; Kel Bormol (SL3-2A) has the only remaining key. Inside is an unfinished tomb. A unique symbol, devised by Kel Bormol himself, has been cast seventeen times on the door: it is a symbol of forgetting, which causes those who fail to save versus spells (with a -2 penalty) to turn away from their present task and adopt some new course of action. The symbol is designed to prevent intruders from entering the chamber.

A block of stone (for the never-begun sarcophagus) stands in the middle of the room. A generic decoration plan was begun, but the only part completed is an image of a legionary (still faceless) with the word ‘Respect’ (in Mithric) in 3’ letters above him.

As the war of Theosophs and Sortians raged (see World of Archontos appendix), the late Archontean-era archmage, Kel Bormol, took precautions for his own safety. He repurposed 
several chambers throughout the Halls as bolt-holes to which he could teleport if conditions in the city grew desperate. This tomb was one of his third-tier refuges. Here he deposited some coin, a few potions, and copies of his spell-books. These items are all concealed in an invisible stone chest fastened to the ceiling with steel bars.

Treasure:
Invisible chest with: 500 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items); potions of gaseous form, clarity, deafening light, dispelling, and truthfulness (see new magic items for the last 
four); and his spell books.

Kel Bormol’s Spell Books (in eleven large volumes): All 1st-level spells plus Basil’s torch treatment, Cleophalus’s look-away spell, and friend of the Hekate (see new spells for all three); all 2nd-level spells plus the Bracteros effect, locate place, Pol’s endless sneezes, pummeling fists of Arak-Zhorr, and wizard’s cache (see new spells for all five); all 3rd-level spells plus garrulous mouth (see new spells); all 4th-level spells plus Dameon’s shadow spell book (see new spells); all 5th-level spells plus harnessing the chaos, the hekate’s bonds, and 
Pol’s improved eye (see new spells for all three); anti-magic shell, curse item (see new spells), death spell, disintegrate, enchant an item, extension III, forceful hand, geas, globe of invulnerability, invisible stalker, legend lore, monster summoning IV, project image, reincarnation, repulsion, stone to flesh, transformation; cacodemon, delayed blast fireball, duo-dimension, grasping hand, limited wish, mass invisibility, monster summoning V, Pol’s recall (see new spells), power word stun, vanish, warding chain of glyphs (see new spells); clenched fist, incendiary cloud, irresistible dance, mass charm, mind blank, mindshift (see new spells), monster summoning VI, permanency, polymorph object, power word blind, spell immunity, symbol; astral spell, crushing hand, gate, meteor swarm, power word kill, prismatic 
sphere, time stop.

### SL6-80: Concealed Corridor Entrance (Partly-submerged)

* The entrance to this corridor is concealed by an illusory wall of the face of the canyon.
	* The floor of this 10’-tall corridor is 5’ below the waterline.
	* Any sizeable waves in the Canyon are likely to create incongruities with the illusion.

### SL6-81: Corridor Entrance (Dry)

* The water in the Canyon laps gently at the lip of this 15’-tall corridor.
	* The entrance corridor and stairs are covered with 2" square lemon-yellow tiles (quite slippery from the wet).

### SL6-82: Plundered Tomb of Phocius Tricotor (Dry)

This chamber is the most visited of the tombs in the Drowned Canyon, as it is the only one whose entrance is completely accessible from above the waterline. It is monumental in size, being some 20’ tall. Mosaics originally covered the walls and ceiling. The tomb was designed for Phocius Tricotor, the adopted son of the great Marius Tricotor (see 6-154), who was slain in operations against the heqeti. Aware of Marius’s grief, his courtiers arranged this elaborate tomb. Sadly, it was plundered in antiquity and little is left save some decorations. Graceful arches lead to subsidiary tombs on the east, west and south sides. 

The mosaics on the walls have been badly damaged by time and looters. The largest intact piece occupies the southwest corner, and shows a stern archon with cropped, grey hair riding a floating platform while pointing at misshapen amphibians. Next to the archon is a man who looks similar, albeit younger. Ancient graffiti names the two figures as “Marius the Great” and “Phocius, his dead son.” The other intact piece of mosaic is in the northeast 
corner, and shows a skinny man in a white scribe’s tunic holding a stylus and a wax tablet; this man has the same hair style, and several prominent blemishes by his nose. More graffiti is scrawled by this image. It reads: “Lucius Cornelius the thief, who stole the divine Marius’s relics.” [GM Note: this person is Lucius Cornelius Scriptor – see 6-135]

In the center of the chamber is a worn, veined-marble dais (10’x10’). In its center stands an unusual vertical sarcophagus that is 5’ square, but 8’ tall. The top 2’ of the sarcophagus have been broken off, leaving a hollow shell. The sarcophagus is empty, but its four sides bear incised images of a young Archontean male, with close-cropped hair, Roman nose, and piercing eyes, engaging in military actions. The north-facing side of the sarcophagus also 
reads “Phocius Tricotor.”

### SL6-83: Side Tomb (Dry)

* A 10’x5’x4’ sarcophagus rests in this 10’-tall side tomb, lid and contents long gone.
	* The walls are decorated with smeared and dripping frescoes of jungle scenes.
	* Two 50’ coils of silken rope are tucked behind the sarcophagus. 

### SL6-84: Side Tomb with Corpse (Dry)

* A 10’x5’x4’ sarcophagus rests in this 10’-tall side chamber, lid and contents gone.
	* The walls were painted cerulean blue, and featured eight figures in Archontean dress.  Their faces have been carefully effaced, leaving bare wall.
* The skeleton of an ancient tomb robber lies sprawled halfway inside and halfway outside the sarcophagus.
	* If the side tomb is entered, the skeleton lurches to its feet and begin moaning (Mithric) “The eyes! They see me! They see you! Beware the eyes!”
		* GM Note: refers to the eyes of Pol (new) in SL6-85, but the origin of the corpse’s fear may well be unclear.
	* The animated skeleton follows PCs through SL6-82 to SL6-85, moaning its warning all the while, but it does not attack.
	* The skeleton wears battered, but usable, leather armor, a long sword, and a gold chain with a silver-and-ivory cameo of an eye hangs around its neck (110 gp). 

1 animated skeleton: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 60’; HD 1; HP 5; #AT 0; Dmg nil. Special defenses: immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold; cutting and piercing weapons do half damage.

### SL6-85: Side Tomb (Dry)

* An empty 10’x5’x4’ sarcophagus in a 10’-tall side chamber, old lid and contents gone.
	* A pair of battered wooden planks provides a new lid, on top of which rest a pair of eyes of Pol (new).
	* The walls were painted, but only a small portion of blue and yellow remains.
* Secret Trapdoor (floor): open doors to move the sarcophagus atop it.
	* The corridor climbs briefly before reaching a second secret door, easy (1 in 4) to locate. From this side, it opens by pressing a 3”-square section of the floor.

### SL6-86: False Tomb of Thekla (Partly-submerged)

Five feet of murky water slosh around in this 10’-tall chamber, which is home to a giant anaconda. The wall frescoes have been ruined by moisture, a moldy mosaic occupies the west wall, and a granite sarcophagus sits in the center of the room on a 2’ dais. On the west wall a jumble of debris has accumulated around what once was a ceremonial rack (for a sword) built into the wall. It is in this debris that the anaconda lairs. Three water-slimed skeletons lie on the floor near the sarcophagus. GM Note: this area was intended as a red-herring for those seeking to loot the tombs of Taticus and Thekla, whose true tomb lies at SL6-88.

Mosaic: The mosaic shows a pair of warriors striking at a huge, hairy troll. One warrior is male and the other female, but both share similar features: they both have long, shoulder-length hair and pointed noses, and they both wear black leather armor, wield falchions, and wear silver lockets looped around their necks. GM Note: a bookish PC has a chance to recognize the pair of warriors in the mosaic as the legendary Archontean hero-twins, Taticus and Thekla, by rolling 4d6 under INT.

Sarcophagus: The lid bears an incised image of a female warrior wearing leather armor and carrying a falchion. The lid of the sarcophagus is already cracked open, and can be fully removed easily, without any sort of check. Only the moldy remains of a female human, wrapped in linen bandages, remain. 

Secret Door (east): The door is normal to locate, and opens by pulling down on the left support for the sword rack that is found on the east wall. Doing so releases a mechanism that causes a panel on the eastern wall to swing into the chamber.

1 giant constrictor snake: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 6+1; HP 43; #AT 2; Dmg 1-4/2-8. Special attacks: constriction.

Treasure: 
Inside the sarcophagus: all the original (meagre) treasure was looted in antiquity, but a pair of brass leg bracelets studded with jet gems is still hidden inside the wrappings (50 gp each). 
Skeletons: black leather armor, scale mail, a mace, a long sword, a purse with 53 ancient silver pennies and 39 ancient gold solidi (see Arden Vul items for both); a silver statuette of a hooded cobra (135 gp); and an elixir of health.

### SL6-87: False Tomb of Taticus (Partly-submerged)

Five feet of water slosh about in this chamber. Although moisture has ruined most of the frescoes, a section of mosaic mounted on the south wall shows a pair of warriors striking simultaneously at a troll. A granite sarcophagus (10’x5’x5’) rests in the center of the chamber on a 2’ dais. Built into the west wall just above the water line is an empty rack, apparently intended for a sword.

Mosaic: One warrior is male and the other female, but both share similar features: they both have long, shoulder-length hair and pointed noses, and they both wear black leather armor, wield falchions, and wear silver lockets looped around their necks. Note: A bookish PC has a chance to recognize the pair of warriors in the mosaic as the legendary Archontean hero-twins, Taticus and Thekla, by rolling 4d6 under INT.

Sarcophagus: The lid bears a crude image scribed in the stone of a warrior wearing leather armor and holding a falchion. The legend reads “Taticus the Strong.” The lid of the sarcophagus can be budged with an open doors check, but it is also trapped (see below). Within is a male body wrapped in shrouds along with some treasure. 

Trap (sarcophagus lid): The lid is trapped such that if the seam is broken between lid and sarcophagus, a powerful set of springs will project the now-broken lid upwards and outwards. Anyone within 10’ of the sarcophagus must roll 3d8 under DEX or take 3-12 HP 
damage from the explosion and stone fragments.

Secret Door (west): The door is normal to find, and opens if a hidden button inside the sarcophagus is located and pressed.

Treasure:
Inside the sarcophagus: 119 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items); a pair of silver and turquoise bracelets (75 gp each); a scroll of magic missile and locate object; and a parchment scroll entitled Fraternal Triumph, or Taticus and Thekla against the Troll (see Arden Vul books).

### SL6-88: Hidden Tomb of the Twins (Dry)

The true tomb of Taticus and Thekla, the legendary Archontean hero-twins, is located here. The 15’-tall chamber is sheathed in blue tiles (6” square), on each of which has been painted the tau (yin-yang) symbol (which symbolizes twins for Archonteans). Perhaps 30% of the tiles have fallen to the floor, leaving the floor littered with broken tiles and ceramic dust. Two sarcophagi dominate the center of the chamber, although an enormous black ‘troll’ stands 
on a dais on the south wall. Between the two sarcophagi is a large patch of living mosaic (see new magic items). 

 The ‘troll’ is 10’ tall, thick and muscled, and covered with black bristly hair. The ‘troll’ is actually a Type IV demon that has used its polymorph self ability to appear as the legendary object of the Twins’ great victory. The demon has been bound to this chamber to fulfill this function – and to defend the gemini blades (see new magic items) – for close to 2,000 years, and is eager for combat and release. Once it has defeated 17 robbers, it will be freed from its task. As such, the first thing it does is Gate in another demon to ensure it defeats any tomb raiders.

Sarcophagi: Both of the 10’x5’x5’ sarcophagi are formed of coal-black basalt. The tops of each sarcophagus bear a heavily incised and silver-filled image of their respective inhabitants, Taticus and Thekla. Taticus appears as a young man dressed in leather armor with a flowing cloak; Thekla is a young woman and dressed similarly. Both have shoulder-length hair and wear lockets. On each sarcophagus, however, the images of the twin’s locket is pierced vertically by one of the legendary gemini blades (see new magic items). The only way to release the lid of either lid is to pull forth the blade from the basalt; to do this, however, requires either a twin or a person of chaotic good or chaotic neutral alignment. 
Within each sarcophagus is some additional treasure.

Living Mosaic: A large, 10’x3’, patch of living mosaic (see new magic items) occupies the space between the two sarcophagi. It depicts area 6-157 and is 75% likely to show troll-like beings moving through the image.

Secret Door (northeast, to SL6-87): This door is easy to locate (1 in 4), and opens by pulling a thin circle of wire nestled in the seam between wall and ceiling.

Secret Door (northwest, to SL6-86): This door is easy to locate (1 in 4), and opens outward by finding and depressing a 3”-square on the south wall.

Secret Door (east, towards SL6-85): This door is hard to find (1 in 8) and only opens by brute force (open doors check to push it towards the east).

Secret Door (west, towards SL6-89): The door is hard to locate (1 in 8) and can only be opened by pulling it inward via a successful open doors check.

1 type IV demon: SZ L; AL CE; AC -1; MV 90’, 120’ flying (Class E); HD 11; HP 78; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/2-8; MR 65%. Constant abilities: infravision. Special attacks: +2 to hit; cause 
fear; darkness 10’ radius; use symbol (fear or discord). Special defenses: half damage from cold, electricity, fire, gas; +1 or better weapons to hit. Special: teleport without error; detect magic; read languages; telekinesis (5,000 gp); project image; create illusion; levitate; polymorph self; dispel magic; gate in demon of type I to IV (60%).

Treasure:
The gemini blades (see new magic items), only removable by chaotic good PCs or by twins.

Tomb of Taticus: a red, hooded, cloak of displacement; a pair of red boots (25 gp); Taticus’s seal matrix, which could be used to make new seals or could be sold to an antiquarian for 3,000 gp; a silver, gold, and bejeweled belt, worth 1,850gp; and a fine platinum cloak pin worth 425 gp.

Tomb of Thekla: a set of red boots of striding and springing; a fine, silk, hooded cloak (50 gp); an amethyst and silver hair pin (450 gp); a gold signet ring (250 gp); a second gold ring set with a huge topaz (650 gp).

### SL6-89: Hidden Staircase up to SL6-31 (Dry)

* A simple granite circular staircase leads upward to SL6-31 from this location.
	* Only accessible via one of two secret doors.
* Secret Door (west): tall and narrow (3’ wide x 8’ tall), opens by pushing the top of the panel, which is set on a horizontal pin.
* Secret Door (east): hard to find (1 in 8), opens by pressing a button on the east wall.

### SL6-90: Tomb Entrance (Submerged)

* A 10’-tall archway leads inward at this point, 15’ below the waterline.
	* The corridor is fully submerged.

### SL6-91: Corridor Entrance (Submerged)

* A 10’-tall square corridor leads inward, 15’ below the waterline.
	* Halfway down the corridor, stairs lead up out of the water.

### SL6-92: Corridor Entrance (Submerged)

* A 10’-tall square corridor entrance may be found here, 15’ below the waterline.
	* The corridor is fully submerged.

### SL6-93: First Tomb of Vipsania Pacifica (Submerged)

Archon Vipsania Pacifica built this area as the antechamber to her true tomb (SL6-94). The chamber is 10’ tall and filled with murky water. Vipsania’s sarcophagus dominates the center of the chamber, while ruined wall frescoes provide hints of color amid the glom. Two giant crayfish lurk in the murky water on either side of the door, eager for a meal.

Sarcophagus: This object is a rococo monstrosity! It is 5’ tall, 10’ long, and 4’ wide, and built of veined marble with 2’-tall porphyry columns set into the base of the sarcophagus on all sides. The lid is solid and massive, with a white effigy of Vipsania built into it. Vipsania appears as a whip-thin, tall woman with waist-length hair and narrowed eyes. She wears a long robe and carries an ankh and an unrolled scroll. Inscribed in tiny letters on the scroll 
are the following words in Mithric: “Vipsania Pacifica, archon of Arden Vul. She brought and required peace.” Unless PCs specifically examine the scroll, they are likely to miss the inscription.

The lid can only be budged with a successful open doors check. Although the contents were looted in antiquity, the tomb-robbers had a warped sense of humor, and left a goblin skull behind. They also left a sherd of pottery with the following mocking note scrawled on it in Mithric: “Vipsania wasn’t so peaceful when we made off with her belongings. Better luck next time!” What the robbers missed was a false bottom, which can be detected as a secret door. Inside the false bottom are a four solid gold rods tied up with gold thread and piece of solid marble carved like a 5”-diameter, rolled-up scroll. Each has a different word inscribed (in Mithric) on it: wrath, love, serenity, and sorrow. The rods can be used to manipulate objects in area SL6-94. The scroll is needed to open the secret door to Vipsania’s true tomb.

Secret Door (west): The door is normal to find. The opening mechanism is a 5”-diameter slot in the wall. The marble scroll in the false-bottom of the sarcophagus fits the slot perfectly.

2 giant crayfish: SZ L; AL N; AC 4; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 4+4; HP 33, 28; #AT 2; Dmg 2-12/2-12. Special attacks: surprise on 3 in 6.

Treasure: 
Four solid gold rods, 1” in diameter and 6” long (850 gp each). The rods can be used to manipulate objects in area SL6-94.

### SL6-94: True Tomb of Vipsania Pacifica (Dry)

Up a narrow staircase may be found the true tomb of Vipsania Pacifica, archon of Arden Vul. The chamber is 10’ tall. Instead of the usual frescoes, four 5’-tall, granite, high-relief images 
of faces stand forth along the bare stone walls. Standing on the floor beneath each visage is a 3’-tall stone urn. Vipsania’s granite sarcophagus stands in the center of the chamber. 

Sarcophagus: The sarcophagus is 10’ long, 3’ wide and 4’ high. The north side bears the words “Vipsania, archon.” The lid is solid and no seam is visible. Four 2”-diameter holes are spaced evenly across the lid, each with a square of colored tile inset next to it: the colors are red, black, pink and pale blue. 

The holes are intended to be used (wisely!) in conjunction with the liquids obtained from the stone visages (see below). Pouring any of the liquids into the appropriately-colored hole causes a seam to appear around the top of the sarcophagus; the lid can then be removed with an open doors check. Yet some combinations have additional magical effects.

The safest solution is to obtain the pale blue liquid (of serenity or peacefulness, that is, the quality associated with Vipsania’s nickname) and pour it into the pale blue hole. Pouring 
the red liquid into the red hole, however, causes the liquid to spontaneously combust; all the contents of the sarcophagus are destroyed. Pouring the black liquid into the black hole generates an oily, thick poison gas; this gas emerges from all four holes in the sarcophagus and fills the chamber within 3 rounds. All present must save or die. The gas dissipates after an hour. Pouring the pink liquid into the pink hole, moreover, inflicts a powerful curse of 
greed on all those within 15’; the curse acts such that each victim will intensely covet the next item of value that he/she glimpses. The greed and obsession for this item will be so great that the victim will not allow it to be possessed by another, nor will he/she allow it to be sold. If a liquid is poured into the inappropriate hole (black into blue, for instance), no effect is produced, but the seam for the lid also does not appear. For the contents of the sarcophagus, see treasure listing below.

Stone Visages
Each of the 5’-tall images shows the same human woman with long hair and an elaborate torc. The mouths of all four are open. The four faces differ, however, with regard to the emotion displayed upon them.

East Face: Vipsania’s mouth is twisted open in a sneer, her eyes are narrowed, and her nostrils are flared. This face represents anger or wrath. If the golden rod from SL6-93 that is marked ‘wrath’ is placed in the angry mouth, a flask filled with red liquid will appear in the stone urn beneath it. If the wrong rod is inserted into the mouth, that rod will be utterly consumed.

South Face: The eyes are open wide, and the mouth is formed in a perfect ‘o’. Here Vipsania depicts sorrow. Should the golden rod inscribed with ‘sorrow’ (from SL6-93) be placed in the mouth, a flask of black liquid appears in the urn beneath the face. If the wrong rod is inserted into the mouth, that rod will be utterly consumed.

West Face: The face’s lips are puckered as if to give a kiss, and the eyes are creased welcomingly with laugh lines. The face depicts ‘love’. If the golden rod marked ‘love’ (from SL6-93) is placed in the mouth, a flask filled with pink liquid appears in the urn beneath 
the head. If the wrong rod is inserted into the mouth, that rod will be utterly consumed.

North Face: Vipsania’s lips are just barely open, and her mouth offers a hint of a smile. Her eyes are half-lidded. This face is meant to depict ‘peace’ or serenity. If the appropriate golden rod from SL6-93 is placed between the lips, a flask with pale blue liquid appears in the urn beneath the face. If the wrong rod is inserted into the mouth, that rod will be utterly consumed.

Treasure: 
Liquids: the red liquid can serve as a potion of fire breath; the black potion is a poison potion; the pink potion is a philter of love; and the blue liquid is a philter of persuasion.

Sarcophagus: in addition to the bones of Vipsania Pacifica, the tomb contains two bolts of beautiful silk from the imperial workshops (250 gp each); an alabaster jar with 111 ancient 
octagonal platinum pieces (see Arden Vul items); a vellum codex bound in red leather entitled the Secreta Secretorum (see Arden Vul books); a rod of rulership (16 charges); a 
tome of understanding; and a gold-and-ruby necklace in a sunburst pattern (5,800 gp).

### SL6-95: Alleged Tomb of Jacinth the Rose (Dry)

The stairs from SL6-91 ensure that this area is dry. Its air is also good, a fact which may cause the clever to realize there is another exit to the chamber. In fact this entire chamber was devised as a clever trick and trap, designed to deter those seeking the more profitable tombs hidden in SL6-96.

The chamber is 12’ tall, brightly lit by a continual light spell, and decorated with vibrant, colorful frescoes. The frescoes are badly damaged by moisture and mold, but show mostly floral scenes with a maiden cavorting through them. The maiden is tall, with black hair, laughing eyes, and pretty teeth. In the center of the 

chamber is a sarcophagus of pink marble. On its lid is a marble effigy of a shapely woman clad in a tunic with an elaborate belt, a brooch, and a flower wreath in her hair. A name is carved on the east side of the sarcophagus: Jacinth the Rose. Aside from her name, the sides of the sarcophagus are carved elaborately with high-relief flowers, including roses, daisies, marigolds, and hyacinths. 

The lid (with effigy) is heavy, and can only be opened via a successful open doors check. If the lid is opened, a puff of poisonous dust envelopes all within 10’ (see below for effects). Inside is a mummified body (not that of Jacinth the Rose) that wears a belt of femininity/masculinity and an amulet of inescapable location. A curse has also been placed on these two items: if either is either successfully removed via remove curse, the cursed item instantly teleports back to this tomb, allowing it to be found by a subsequent tomb-robber.

GM Note: Jacinth the Rose was once a well-known figure in Archontean folklore, although her stories are largely forgotten today. She was a notorious trickster, with a malicious bent (unlike that of Larel One-Eye – see World of Archontos appendix). It is unlikely that most PCs will have heard of Jacinth the Rose, although the GM might deem that a bard or other scholarly PC could succeed at a roll under INT (5d6 for bards, 6d6 for others) in order to have heard of her devious reputation for not being what she seemed. Of course, should PCs have located and read a copy of the Song of Jacinth the Rose (see Arden Vul books) they will have a much better chance of recognizing that this name spells trouble. Her corpse does not rest here at all. Indeed, according to the Song, it is to be found in the forests north of Archontos.

Trap (poisonous dust): This poisonous dust is released in a 10’-diameter cloud when the lid of Jacinth the Rose’s sarcophagus is opened. It is slow-acting, and causes death in 1-4 days after much choking, coughing, and spitting of blood. Those making a save versus poison avoid breathing it in and are immune.

Secret Door (south): This door is normal to locate. Only by locating the largest carved rose on the sarcophagus and pressing its center will the door open.

Treasure:
A belt of femininity/masculinity; a brooch of inescapable location; and 357 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items) scattered inside the tomb.

### SL6-96: Multiple Tomb Chamber (Dry)

This large hall is the resting place of the famous alchemist (and infamous libertine), Plotina. The chamber is 15’ tall, with unpainted walls. Six simple stone sarcophagi hold the remains of Plotina’s favorite concubines. Her own resting place is a huge stone table at the south end of the room; there she lies as a mummy, surrounded by many potion bottles. A stone chest sits under the table.Sarcophagi: Each of these identical sarcophagi is 8’x3’x3’ in size, with the face of a young woman and a name inscribed on the lid. When Plotina arises from her table, the ghasts that occupy each tomb push off their sarcophagus lids and rush to defend their 
mistress. The names of the concubines are: Levia, Domitilla, Helena, Reseda, Vincia, and Irene. Each sarcophagus contains a piece of jewelry.

Table and Mummy: Plotina the mummy lies on the stone table, surrounded by samples of her alchemical genius. As soon as the chamber is entered, she rises from the table, whispers (in Mithric) ‘More lovers for me!’ and begins to hurl potions at the intruders; her former concubines – now ghasts – swiftly join the fray. The following potions and concoctions are available for Plotina to hurl or use; due to her instability, roll randomly to determine which potions she employs in a given round: greek fire x6 (see new magic items), molasses x3 (see new magic items), hostile levitation x2 (see new magic items), fire resistance x2 (see new 
magic items), frost cage x3 (see new magic items), singing birds x3 (see new magic items). Also on the table are 4 potions of extra healing, a potion of invisibility, a potion of superheroism, and a potion of levitation.

Secret Door (north): The door is easy to locate (1 in 4) and opens by pulling it inward by brute force (open doors check).Secret Door (east): This door is normal to locate, and rotates on a horizontal pin. It opens by pushing the lower part of the door, allowing one to crawl into the tunnel to SL6-89.

Trapped Secret Door (west): This door is normal to locate. It appears to have a lock, but this is a red herring. The lock has a poison needle designed to stab any who try to pick it (save or die). The door actually opens by standing on a 6” square of pavement and then pushing inward.

### SL6-97: Pair of Looted Tombs (Submerged)

* This 8’-tall chamber is completely undecorated.
	* The chamber is the breeding ground for 4 giant crayfish. 
* Two large granite tombs stand in its center, each rough-carved and without decoration save the name of the inhabitant (north is “Cassius”, south is “Heraclion”)
	* GM Note: two minor archons; see SL6-98 for why they are found here.
* Secret Door (south): opens to a floor-plate covered by the sarcophagus of Heraclion (obvious once it's moved).

### SL6-98: Tomb of Psallion the Logothete (Dry)

The once-important logothete, Psallion the Red, built this tomb for himself during the waning days of the Archontean tomb-building period (during the archonate of Borsella Iron-Fist). Psallion had area SL6-97 constructed as a red-herring, and stocked it with the sarcophagi of two minor archons of the previous century. The narrow stairs and corridor from SL6-97 are 8’ tall and undecorated.

Trap (falling block): The corridor leading to Psallion’s tomb (SL6-98) has a falling block trap. If tripped a 5’ cube of granite drops from the ceiling, inflicting 8-48 HP damage on the intruder; successfully rolling 3d6 under DEX indicates half damage. If triggered, the trap 
completely blocks access to the tomb; those wishing to enter it will need picks, mauls, and other equipment.

Psallion’s Tomb: Psallion’s tomb is compact, but richly decorated. The west wall includes a beautiful mosaic showing a detailed image of an old-style logothete’s office. The logothete (Psallion), dressed in cerulean tunic, sits on a dais to the right of the scene, while lesser officials (chartoularii) count coins using abacuses and petitioners gesture pitifully at the logothete. On the east wall is a standard depiction of a (female) archon; the archon wears her toga and cradles fasces and a baculus. The only nod to a specific archon is the fact that her face is grimly set and she’s shaking a fist over her shoulder (Borsella Iron-Fist).

The sarcophagus is a beautiful marble affair carved elaborately with images of chartoularii and logothetes. The lid is sealed and requires an open doors check to remove. Inside is a second, wooden, sarcophagus with gilt and lapis decoration showing a pudgy man of late middle years, with shoulder-length hair and a pug nose. Inside is Psallion’s mummified body, along with much treasure.

Secret Door (north): The door leading to SL6-97 is easy to find (1 in 4) and opens from this side by pressing an easily-discovered square panel on the riser of the first stair leading south.

Secret Door (South): The door leading to SL6-96 is easy to locate from this side (1 in 4). It opens by locating and pulling a wire that is concealed in the seam between wall and ceiling.

Treasure: 
The mummy wears a brooch of shielding (with 45 points of damage reduction remaining), a circlet of persuasion, and a set of exquisite jade bracelets, arm bands, and torc (the set is worth 12,500 gp). Scattered around the mummy are 3,333 ancient silver pennies (see Arden Vul items), a scroll of protection from petrification and a scroll of stone to flesh.
