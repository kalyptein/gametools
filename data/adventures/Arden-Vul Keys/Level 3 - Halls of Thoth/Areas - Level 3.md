### Overview

Although not the topmost level of the dungeon, the Halls of Thoth are the most accessible level to the surface (via the Grand Pyramid of Thoth at AV-15, which leads to 3-1). As a result, it sees a fair amount of traffic, particular in its central areas (3-1 to 3-20 or so). It contains numerous points of egress and access to Levels 1, 2, 4, and 5, as well as to several sub-levels. In addition to being significant for its accessibility, the level is also notable for its size; it is one of the largest levels of the entire complex.

The northern, worked areas of the level (3-1 to 3-162) were mostly constructed by the priesthood of Thoth during the period of Archontean domination, although the rival priesthood of Set delved the westernmost section that leads directly to the Forum of Set (4-2). Today, the precincts of Thoth are divided into smaller regions, many controlled by one of the factions of Arden Vul.

A group of evil, grimalkin extortionists led by Parames Plumthorn (3-5) has but recently set up operations (including a poison manufactory – see 3-4) just outside the entry chamber (3-2); they claim suzerainty over areas 3-2 to 3-35 and demand tribute from any who enter this territory.

The grimalkin have run into trouble with the goblins of King Weskenim, whose main hold lies below (SL4), but who have established a foothold on Level 3 (area 3-7) as well as on Level 5 
(5-43 to 5-51). The goblins resent the newly arrived halflings, and actively seek allies in their extermination.

To the west, the priesthood of Set has re-established its influence in its ancient demesne (3-89 to 3-111) and conduct dire rituals in their upper temple (3-90).

The central regions of the level, which originally served as the administrative hub of the priests of Thoth, is now home to the highly disciplined cohorts of the beastmen of Deino (3-120 to 3-162). The beastmen have cleared all the areas east of the Great Hall (3-120), and conduct frequent patrols both north, towards the rest of the old precincts of Thoth, and south into the Great Cavern (3-163, 3-172).

The unworked, natural, portions of the level are dominated by the massive Great Cavern, which itself is bisected by a subterranean river (the Seamly Run - see 3-217, 3-230 and 3-231) and a small lake (3-164). No one faction calls this area home, although the deranged magician Trocadero of Newmarket (3-176), who thinks himself the reincarnation of Ptarmis of Thoth (3-174), is trying to lay claim to the southern Great Cavern through his hold over the fungal foresters.

Significant Regions of Level 3

1. Northern Region: Precincts of Thoth (3-1 to 3-70)
The halls in this region were the center of the public rituals held in 
honor of Thoth. The great statue of Thoth (the Glory of Thoth - 3-2), 
the three mystery chambers (3-9, 3-10, and 3-11), and the mortuary 
centers for devotees (3-16 and 3-22) were among the ‘sights’ visited 
by the faithful. Of course the priests of Thoth also kept some sites 
carefully hidden, as befit the god of hidden knowledge. 
Factions: The band of evil halfling thugs and brigands led by the 
notorious Phlebotomas Plumthorn (3-5) occupies a key (and 
highly defensible) section of the region adjacent to the main entry 
point from the surface (areas 3-3 to 3-6). They claim authority over 
the entire region and attempt to extort licenses and tribute from all 
who pass through area 3-2.

Construction: Almost all construction in this region is Archontean, 
with 10’ ceilings and iron-bound wooden doors. The Thoth pri-
ests preferred to sheath the stone walls with plaster, on which 
they painted elaborate frescoes celebrating Thoth. Many of the 
frescoes are still visible and might reveal some general or even 
useful information to those unfamiliar with Thoth. Considering 
a 10’x10’ section of wall for a turn might reveal some useful and 
comprehensible information (25% chance). If so indicated, the 
GM should roll d100 on the table on the next page to determine 
what the art-lover has learned.
Environment: Cool and dry

2. Western Region: Hidden Temples (areas 3-71 to 3-117)
To the west of the public areas of the cult of Thoth was the great 
private temple of the Thoth priesthood (3-71). Quite nearby is 
the main temple to Set, which was restored over the past several 
decades by a rejuvenated Set cult. Although the two temples were 
distinct in antiquity, the modern Set cult has connected the two 
areas via new construction and is contemplating expansion into 
the empty halls of their former rival. 
Factions: The cult of Set fully controls important sections of this 
region (3-89 to 3-110). Reckless incursions into Set’s territory will 
be met swiftly by deadly force. 
Construction: All worked areas are Archontean, with 10’ ceilings 
and iron-bound wooden doors. Thothian areas were plastered 
in antiquity and covered in frescoes (see table in region 1); the 
Set cult preferred to decorate the stone directly, and adopted no 
general artistic scheme (hence no table). 
Environment: Cool and dry

3. Central Region: Precincts of the Beastmen (3-120 to 3-162)
In antiquity this was the administrative and residential district for 
the priest of Thoth, centering around the iconic Great Hall (3-123), 
which extended upwards to Sub-Level 3. Today the non-secret 
areas form the domain of the beastmen and their foul mistress, 
Deino (3-158).

Factions: The beastmen are the dominant players in this region. 
They patrol the area regularly in banda (patrols) of six plus a 
sergeant. They are always willing to negotiate first, but are quick to 
defend themselves. The will warn those visitors whom they like or 
admire not to seek audiences with their mistress. 
Construction: All worked areas are Archontean, typically with 
10’ ceilings and iron-bound wooden doors. The beastmen have 
worked hard to scrub away any of the old images of the cult of 
Thoth, leaving the walls bare of decoration in most places.
Environment: Cool and dry

Generic Wall Iconography for Northern Region: Precincts of Thoth

D100 Description of Image(s) GM Notes

01-20
Ibis-headed Thoth worshipped by orange-robed priests

One of the most common images of Thoth was as an ibis-headed person (c.f. his cult statues at AV-15 and 3-2). Orange robes with cylindrical headdresses indicate Thoth priests

21-30
A large ibis flanked by servitor baboons wielding clubs

Thoth was commonly represented by ibises and baboons

31-35
Baboons beat a black boar with clubs

The black boar is a symbol of Set, the rival of Thoth

36-45
Ibis-headed Thoth points with left arm to a Mithric glyph. Two words in Mithric script spew fromThoth’s mouth on a slip of parchment

The Glyph is that for magic. The words say “I am.” To readers of 
Mithric, this is simple: “I am magic”, that is, Thoth is the source 
of magic. The placement of the left arm is a clue to the working 
of the statues in 3-2, 3-15 and 3-40

46-55
Loops of parchment spew from ibis-headed Thoth’s 
mouth and into the hands of numerous human beings, 
some in orange robes. Words are visible on the parchment

Thoth was the source of writing. The words say
“Writing is power” in Mithric

56-65
A standard image of ibis-headed Thoth has been
defaced, and graffiti in the form of a boar (50%) or
a dog-like animal with curved snout, square ears
and a forked tail (50%)

The boar and the Set animal are common representations of 
Set. The modern cult of Set (see 3-89 to 3-117 and much of 
Level 4) is responsible for the graffiti.

66-75
A baboon crouching in the ‘scribe’ position (knees pulled 
to chest), with a book open on its knees. The left paw of 
the baboon is raised in greeting.

A reference to Thoth’s role as recorder of the deeds of the dead, 
and in his baboon form. The placement of the arm is a clue to 
the working of the statues at 3-2, 3-15 and 3-40

76-80
Ibis-headed Thoth walks beside a woman bearing a white feather in her hand; to either side are sarcophagi.

Thoth was associated with Maat, whose image was the white 
feather. A clue to the efficacy of the feathers of Maat found at 
3-19 in repelling the undead of the catacombs (3-22)

81-90
Ibis-headed Thoth holds the reins of a chariot in
his outstretched left hand. At Thoth’s side is a
rayed orb. The chariot travels through the sky,
above adoring orange-clad priests

The Archontean cult of Thoth associated him with bringing 
the light of knowledge, and saw him as the driver of the solar 
chariot. A reference to the Litany of Light (see 2-2 through 2-5).

91-95
Unusually, ibis-headed Thoth stands with both 
arms raised above his head. In front of him, human 
worshippers fall into a pit.

A clue to the danger of manipulating the statue of Thoth at 
UP-1 and 3-15 in the wrong way

96-100
Humans bearing gifts of gems, cloth, golden statuettes 
and scrolls approach ibis-headed Thoth, whose left
hand is outstretched in benediction

An important clue to manipulating the statues at 3-2, 3-15 and 
3-40 so as to locate the treasure room (3-23). Also a hint about 
the benefits of offering Thoth (3-2) gifts.



4. Southern Region: Great Cavern and Surrounding Caves (3-163 to 3-230)
South of the Great Hall of Thoth lies the enormous Great Cavern 
(3-163, 3-172), bisected by an underground river called the Seamly 
Run (3-217, 3-230, 3-231) and a small lake (3-164). Numerous side 
caves and tunnels connect to the Great Cavern, and a few tombs
crafted by the paranoid in antiquity may be found scattered among 
those caves. Ptarmis, a priest of Thoth, discovered the Great 
Cavern during the glory years of Archontean Arden Vul. It was 
he who cultivated the giant species of mushroom that form the 
current fungal forest, it was he who introduced the fungal foresters 
as cultivators of the mushrooms, and it was he (and his men) who 
built the hematite gates (3-177) and the parvis with its great chair 
(3-175, 3-176). So enamored was Ptarmis by the Great Cavern that 
he commanded his tomb be prepared here (see 3-174).
Factions: No faction controls this region. The fungal foresters 
patrol the fungal forest, but are not territorial. The beastmen’s Long 
Range Cavern Patrol frequents the Great Cavern in order to bring 
food and other supplies to Deino and their comrades. A fearsome 
hag has a small domain among the river caves (3-204 to 3-206, 
3-219, 3-221 to 3-224). The cult of Set has a tiny foothold to the far 
west (3-193 to 3-195, 3-211 to 3-212).
Construction: The few worked areas are Archontean, albeit with 
stone doors.
Environment: The area is substantially more humid than the rest of 
the area, and some sections (e.g. the Great Cavern) are quite warm.


## Level 3: 1 - 15

### 3-1: Entrance Stairs (up to UP-5)

* The stairs down from the Great Pyramid (UP-5) are steep and cramped, descending  350’ and exiting into 3-2.
	* They were once flanked with brightly colored frescoes outlining the glories of Thoth.
	* Now blackened with soot, grime, and desecration. Little is left: a flash of gold paint, a blue beak, some broken runes.
	* A variety of graffiti, some informational and some obscene, 1d4 instances of graffiti scratched onto each 10’ section of wall.

D20 Graffiti GM Notes

1-4
A name: e.g., Gil, Aethelwulf, Hoss, Flet, Jilken, Tom the Mighty, Rache, Dalton, Roger the 
Rapier, Anna the Archer, etc. 

The GM could or should add names to this list that reflect figures from his/her own 
campaign. In the samples, Dalton and Roger the Rapier are both leaders of rival NPC adventuring groups. The language/script in which the names are written varies, either at choice of GM or as appropriate to a name. For example, Dalton and Roger are both Archontean and thus their names are in that language

5
One of the dog troopers warned us not to seek an audience with his mistress, the powerful sorceress Deino. Why not?

A reference to the beastmen (3-138 to 3-162) and the dangers posed by any meeting with Deino (3-158). Language: Archontean

6
Thoth’s knowledge - and his wealth - remains hidden. But I know how to unlock it. Look to the arms!

A reference to the puzzle involving the statues at 3-2, 3-15, and 3-40, which if manipulated correctly reveal the path to the hoard at 3-23/3-24. Language: Elvish

7
I hate grimalkin! (written 7’ upthe wall)

A reference to the band of halfling thugs who dominate parts of Level 3 (3-2 to 3-6). Language: Wiskin

8
The feathery blessing of Maat fends off the walkers! Do not ignore her soft offering!

A hint about how use of the feather of Maat (3-19) will render the user immune from the undead of the catacombs of Thoth (3-22). Language: Mithric

9-10
Plumthorn Rules these Halls!  Obey Him!

Written 3’ from the ground. A reference to the leader of the halflings who inhabit 3-2 to 3-6. 
Language: Archontean

11
The Darlings are stupid. They left the portcullis open again. I hope they all die horribly.

Refers to the portcullises at 3-21, and the inadvisability of leaving them open (so undead can access the eastern areas). Darlings is a reference to Dalton’s Darlings, one of the suggested rival NPC adventuring parties (see NPC appendix). Language: Archontean

12
The Darlings claim this level! All the treasure is ours! So long, suckers!

A reference to Dalton’s Darlings, one of the suggested rival NPC adventuring parties (see NPC appendix). Language: Archontean

13
Wulf - Wait for me in the pyramid room. If you don’t see me, I will have ascended. 
[Signed] Edgar

A reference to the small pyramid in 3-11, and its ability to teleport explorers to 2-8.
Language: Thorcin

14
Grimalkin rule ok! (Written at halfling height)

A positive reference to Phlebotomas Plumthorn and his band of extortionists (see 3-2 to 
3-6). Language: Archontean

15
A faint and primitive sketch of a biped with huge thighs and an amphibian head. 
An arrow points to its eye, with the caption ‘danger’

An image of a pukel-mander (see new magic items, see 2-56C, 3-11, etc.). Placing a tear of Kauket (see new magic items)in the pukel-mander’s eye canbe quite dangerous! The
caption is in Mithric

16
A crude map of 3-2, 3-15 and 3-16 with an ‘x’ and ‘look here’ scrawled next to the intersection at 3-15 

Self-explanatory, with an oblique hint as to the significance of the statue of Thoth at 3-15.
Language: Archontean

17
We shall return.  The secrets of  the Paleologue will not remain hidden. Look to Gog for directions.

A reference to the lost tomb of Hithra Paleologos (3-36) and the fact that Gog (5-2) can give 
directions to many locations (but not to 3-36). Language: Elvish

18
We followed the arrogant, red-armored fools into the great temple of Thoth, but then we 
lost them … and half our party.

A hint that the cult of Set is located west of the Great Temple of Thoth (3-71), i.e. at areas 3-89 to 3-117. Also an oblique reference to the danger of the slime kraken in 3-71. 
Language: Thorcin

19
Grumak went for a boat ride in the lake. Big mistake.

Refers to the lake (3-164) that bisects the Great Cavern (3-163 and 3-172), and is an oblique 
hint about the giant crabs that infest the waters of the lake.  Language: Wiskin

20
KK is watching us all the time! Don’t trust the talking puppets!

A reference to Kerbog Khan (see SL12-25) and one of his many types of automatons.
Language: Archontean

### 3-2: The Glory of Thoth

* At the foot of the long staircase from the surface, this 30' high chamber was originally the main public site for the veneration of Thoth.
	* Lit by guttering torches (placed by the grimalkin) in sconces along the north, south and west walls.  They shed dim light, but don't fully illuminate the room's center.
	* The wall plaster is badly damaged, but the ceiling plaster is still intact.
		* If able to see the ceiling clearly, there is an image of humans bearing valuable goods – gems, cloth, golden statuettes, scrolls – to ibis-headed Thoth.
			* Thoth is pointing with an outstretched left hand, while his right hand is flat against his thigh (a clue concerning the puzzle of 3-2a).
	* Substantial debris - wrecked furniture, destroyed armor and equipment, bits of bone and leather - has accumulated in the four corners of the chamber.
		* There is dust everywhere, but clear paths lead from the stairs to 3-3, 3-12, 3-15, and 3-31, and no dust is found around the central statue.
	* A grand statue of Thoth stands in the center of the chamber (3-2a).
	* The body of a recently slain adventurer slumps against the west wall.
		* The grimalkin have already looted it, but missed a clerical talisman (find traps) stuffed into his boot.
* The Poisoner Extortionists
	* Any lights or noise (such as experimenting with the statue) will bring some shouts from 3-3, followed by the arrival of a group of 6 grimalkin, led by Rosk Winterclaw.
		* Rosk and his thugs interrogate the party, and inform them that in order to explore the dungeon each of them must buy an ‘adventuring license’ from the ‘big boss’ of this area, his ‘good friend,’ Parames Plumthorn (3-5).
		* Licenses cost 25 gp up front, plus 10 gp per sortie into 3-2, plus a 10% tithe of any treasure (including magic items) found in the dungeon.
			* If they pay up, the grimalkin treat them neutrally, although they are extra-vigilant so as to secure any subsequent ‘fees’.
			* If they refuse to pay, but look powerful, the thugs retreat to 3-3 to join their comrades; then engage in guerrilla warfare against the PCs from this point onward.
			* If they refuse, but look weak, Rosk and his men attack.  They'll take prisoners for ransom, sale to the Setites, or as a Mortality test subject.

Rosk Winterclaw, 5th-level grimalkin thief: SZ S; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 5, HP 22; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (short sword) or 2-5 (dagger). Abilities: STR 16, INT 9, WIS 10, DEX 17, CON 10, CHA 15. Special: thief skills are PP 60%, OL 62%, F/RT 50%, MS 52%, HS 57%, HN 25%, CW 77%, RL 30%.

##### 3-2a: Statue of Thoth 

* This massive onyx statue of the ibis-headed god is 15’ tall stands on a granite pedestal (3’ tall), facing north.
	* Thoth’s ibis head is made of white marble. His eyes are empty sockets.
	* A perfectly proportioned and lifelike human body, right foot is advancing slightly in classic Egyptian fashion.
	* His arms hang at his sides, but rotate on stone pins.
		* They can be pulled upward and forward to any position between 0 (arm at his side) and 180 degrees (hand pointing straight up at the ceiling).
	* If the floor around the statue is closely examined, 2-in-6 chance to notice scoring, as if a heavy stone object (such as the statue) had been dragged across the floor.
* At the foot of the statue is a large stone chest that is part of the pedestal.
	* Worshipers would deposit their offerings into the chest.
	* If a magic scroll (arcane or divine) is placed in the chest and the name of Thoth is invoked (in any form whatsoever, as long the name is mentioned), the donor gain +1 to Int or Wis (random).  The scroll vaporizes instantly.
		* If the spell was 1st to 3rd level (magic user or clerical): lasts 1 week.
			* Can be gained once per week.
		* If the spell was 4th level or above: permanent.
			* Int and Wis can each be increased once, ever.  Which stat is gained is still random, so it may take more than just 2 scrolls to boost each stat.
		* Any symbol of Set placed in the chest produces a column of black flame (5d6 damage) engulfing everything within 25’ of the statue. 
* The statue is also the key to an important puzzle that opens the hidden treasury.
	* If the arms of all three statues of Thoth on Level 3 (at 3-2, 3-15, and 3-40) set so the left hand is parallel to the floor (90 degrees) and the right is at his side (0 degrees), the pedestal here grinds backwards to reveal a set of stairs leading downwards toward the north.
		* After 1 hour of inactivity, the arms reset to default (both facing down).
		* The grimalkin have not figured out the puzzle (but know there's a secret door of some kind under the statue), and the Setites are too afraid of the statue to manipulate it.
	* Hidden Staircase and Passageway: descend 10' down dusty, cobweb-choked stairs to a 5' wide, 7' tall tunnel northwest.
		* The walls are plaster covered with colorful images: Thoth in majesty, Thoth receiving wisdom, languages of various sorts being spewed from the mouths of ibises and baboons, etc. 

### 3-3: Portcullis and Grimalkin Guardpost

* The passage has been fitted with an iron gate, in the center of which is a (grimalkin-sized) iron door.
	* The two door guards keep the key.  The lock is cheap (+10% to pick).
	* They will never allow the PCs to pass on their own; if a parlay is required, either Rosk (3-2) or Parames himself (3-5) will come to the gate to negotiate.
* 2 guards man the post.  If unaware of approach, they will be chatting idly.
* Nearby a horn hangs from a peg hammered into an image of Thoth.
	* If the party is known to be hostile, or if they show hostility, a guard sounds it, calling grimalkin from from 3-4, 3-5 and 3-6 who begin arriving in 1d4 rounds.

2 1st-level grimalkin fighters: SZ S; AL NE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 1; HP: 8, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 2-7 (club), or 2-5 (sling). Possessions: studded leather armor and shield; spears; clubs; slings; 3-18 sp each.

### 3-4: Ancient Tombs and Halfling Camp

* This was a burial chamber for notables in the cult of Thoth, and has been badly treated by time; the walls stained with soot, urine, and worse.
	* Three massive stone sarcophagi sit empty in the center of the room, lids pried open long ago, lying shattered on the floor.
	* The chamber is lit by three large candelabra, each placed near a sarcophagus, as well as a small cookfire in the northwest corner and a tripod of heating in the southeast corner.
	* The northeast corner of the room is open to the chasm (3-38).  A small parapet of rubble (3’ high) has been erected across that opening.
		* Covered passage (north): led to 3-40, filled with rubble, bricked up, and plastered over in antiquity.  The grimalkin haven't noticed it yet.  Detect as secret door.
	* The poison manufactory is set up along the south wall.
		* A rickety table with a set of glass alchemical equipment (500 gp), including two alembics, a retort, two crucibles and a mortar and pestle.
		* Beside the table, a burlap sack with 6 glass bulbs of clear, viscous liquid (spider venom, 30 gp each) and 3 sacks of herbs, dyes, and alchemical powders (45 gp each).
		* On the other side, a padded strongbox (locked) with 18 small glass vials with the word “Mortality” etched on the side (the street name of Parames’s poison), filled with a sticky, green substance.
			* Mortality: 2d4 rounds onset, 20 damage, save for half.
			* Each vial holds 3 doses and sells for 100 gp to the right buyer.
			* Because it is so valuable, Parames does not automatically issue it to his rank and file thugs, reserving it for himself, Rosk (3-2), and Blandveg (3-5).
			* If Parames realizes that his crew is under concerted attack and has time, he will issue poison to the 1st-level fighters and 2nd-level thieves.

* In time, the grimalkin may erect an unsteady, makeshift rope bridge anchored to the sarcophagi across the chasm between 3-4 and 3-40 (20’ span) to explore further.

* Tactical Note: The grimalkin here and elsewhere fight from behind the tombs, using them as cover (75%).

5 1st-level halfling fighters: SZ S; AL NE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 1; HP: 10, 9, 8, 8, 7; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 2-7 (club), or 2-5 (sling). Possessions: studded leather armor and shield; spears; 
clubs; slings; 3-18 sp each.

5 2nd-level halfling thieves: SZ S; AL NE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 11, 10, 10, 9, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (short sword), 1-4 (dagger), or 2-5 (sling). Special: the thieves have DEX 17, and the following thief skills: PP 45%, OL 44%, F/RT 30%, MS 36%, HS 35%, HN 15%, CW 71%. Possessions: leather armor; short swords; daggers, slings; 3-18 sp each.

### 3-5: More Ancient Tombs, with Halfling Leaders

* This room is almost identical to 3-4: formerly gilded luxury paintings now stained with soot and other unknown substances.  The three leaders of the Poisoners reside in this chamber.
	* Three stone sarcophagi lie broken and looted in the center of the chamber.
		* A false bottom in the southern sarcophagus has escaped detection.
			* A silver, bejeweled holy symbol of Thoth (850 gp); 575 ancient copper bits and 352 ancient silver pennies; a moldering illusionist scroll (phantasmal force, phantom armor, invisiblity); 2 arrows of striking (new).
	* The northeastern corner of the chamber is open to the chasm.
		* A 3’-tall parapet of debris is piled across the edge, with noisy bells and bits of metal tied to strings as a crude alarm if something comes out of the chasm.
	* A locked, iron-banded wooden chest and an iron lock (key held by Parames).
		* 432 copper pieces; 243 sp; 957 gp; two ancient holy symbols of Thoth in the form of baboons (150 gp); a holy symbol of Set in the form of a crocodile (100 gp); six gems (10, 20, 30, 10, 50, and 130 gp); 3 codices (Great Villains of Archontos, part IV: Larsinius the Exarch, Thorcin Poisons and their Cures, and Emperors of Archontos, Volume I)
		* Blandveg’s spell book: enlarge, friends, jump, magic missile, jump, magic aura, read magic, shield, sleep; Frigg’s jelly legs (new), knock, mirror image, scare.
	* Supplies: 2 large casks of ale, several sides of curing meat (deer), several bags of turnips, apples, and potatoes, and a large sack of rock-hard biscuits.
	* Although Rosk Winterclaw has his bedroll here, he is usually in 3-2.

* Negotiating with Plumthorn
	* Phlebotomas does not typically negotiate with newcomers, leaving the mundane business and dirty work to his lieutenant, Rosk.  Only in the case of pressing need, or if visitors have convinced the guards at 3-3 that they have valuable information, will Plumthorn deign to parlay.
	* He might be willing to trade information. Parames knows the following information about the Halls:
		* a. Parames suspects there is a secret door connected to the statue in 3-2.
		* b. there is at least one room across the chasm (i.e., 3-40).
		* c. goblins lurk to the southeast (3-7); they would like to control area 3-2, but the grimalkin have stymied them.
		* d. occasional groups of hooded figures have been seen moving between the west and the south. (Set worshipers)
		* e. dangerously large spiders lurk in the chasm
		* f. Parames’s men report strange whoops, hoots, and barks drifting down from higher up in the chasmg. The guards have witnessed some dangerous undead moving around to the west of 3-2. (ghouls)
		* h. dangerous, highly-organized beastmen are encamped to the south: ruthless, disciplined and best avoided. They worship a goddess called Deino (3-158).
		* i. the risky stairs at 3-21 lead to a level above this one.
		* j. the lower halls are creepy and dangerous, not carved by the ibis priests. The stair to Level 5 (3-12) leads to a cave next to a cursed, pillar-ridden hall.

### 3-7: Goblin Outpost, w/ access to 5-44a

* This small chamber is merely an widened area at one end of the 250’ long tunnel connecting 3-6 with 5-44A.  It is unlit.
	* The goblins had begun work on an extension (the spur in 3-6) before the grimalkin arrived and drove them out of the level.

### 3-8: Robing Room

* Accessed by a flight of steps which descend 15’ to a simple wooden door. 
* This chamber was a robing room for priests serving in one of the three chambers of mystery (3-9, 3-10, 3-11).
	* Inside is a thick layer of trash - bits of leather, ruined clothing, scraps of metal, and a foul-smelling bolus of decaying animal matter.
		* Searching 2 Turns finds a white glass activation square.
* Secret Door (south): easy to detect (1 in 4), opens by sliding a 4’-square panel into the wall.
	* This leads to a narrow hallway of plain rock and a set of rough-hewn stone steps leading upward to 3-67.

### 3-9: Chamber of Painful Knowledge

* A mystery chamber, designed to demonstrate to the faithful that the acquisition of knowledge is difficult and sometimes painful.
	* Dark, but numerous (empty) sconces line the walls.
	* A harmless layer of grey-green mist rises 3’ from the floor throughout the chamber. 
		* Dissipates if the pool in 3-10 is cleansed.
	* Three stone benches face a sunken area, 8’ below the level of the floor (the mist is thus 6’ deep here).  Five steps lead into the sunken area.  At the center is a 15' high onyx pillar.
	* The usual mixture of trash clutters the room, along with almost completely obliterated wall frescoes.
		* High on the western wall,  partly obscured by grime is inscribed (Mithric): Thou May Ask of Thoth What Thou Will, Provided Thou Accept His Judgment.
* Pillar of Truth
	* One can grip the onyx pillar and speaks aloud a question (1 per user per month).
		* The question must involve the past (not the future), and be primarily factual (i.e., nothing like ‘what were so-and-so enemies thinking ...’).
		* Such questions have a 50% chance of being answered, but an electrical jolt deals 1d6 per 2 levels of the asker (1d3 for an odd-numbered levels).

### 3-10: Pool of Youth

* The second of the chambers of mystery of the cult of Thoth, this room was originally designed to impress devotees with the curative powers of the god. 
	* Badly damaged wall frescoes are impossible to make out, except near the ceiling.
	* A continual light spell was cast in the center of the ceiling centuries ago.
	* A harmless grey-green mist rises 3’ above the floor throughout the chamber.
* A 20’-diameter pool rimmed with a 1’-tall, blue-granite lip, not fully obscured by the mist.
	* The liquid is a dark, sludgy brown, and reeks with a foul and disgusting odor.
		* Despite its vile appearance, aroma, and taste, it still holds some magic.  Wading into the pool and drinking from it cures 1d8 HP and has a 50% chance of curing all diseases.
			* Refills 1d6 draughts per week
		* It has been used as a latrine by monsters and by passing Set guardsmen for many decades, affecting its appearance and the efficaciousness.
* Cleansing the Pool
	* It can be cleansed by mixing 3 vials of holy water into the sludge, using a potion of sweet water, or by casting purify water or purify food and drink on it.
	* If the pool is cleansed, it turn back to a deep azure color, and the mist disperses after 1-6 hours.  It heals 3d4 HP and always cures disease (still 1 per weak per user).

13 / 20
1 cubic foot of water = 4 draughts
pool purified!

### 3-11: Pyramid of Venerable Age

* The room is shaped like a huge isosceles triangle. with a 50' ceiling beyond torchlight.
	* It is unlit, although numerous wall sconces await torches. 
	* A layer of harmless grey-green mist rises 3’ from the floor and covers the floor around the pyramid.
		* It dissipates after the pool in 3-10 is cleansed.
	* The chamber is dominated by a massive, 40’-tall triangular pyramid of closely fitted granite with a truncated tip, creating a platform.
		* On all three sides, stairs cut into the granite lead up to a central platform, where the mystery was accomplished.
		* The platform has a triangle of lapis-lazuli at its center.  In 3-11 a steel control rod sticks up from the center.
			* Standing on the lapis triangle and depressing the bar causes a cloud of dense smoke to engulf the pyramid's top, and anyone there is teleported to 2-8.  The smoke disperses in about 15 seconds.
				* Rotating a pair or ornamental Thoth figures on the bar's handle before activating it teleports one into the hidden chamber instead.
	* Frescoes on the walls illustrate Thoth’s conquest of aging and death, with creatures of all sorts - including humans - rising up from the ground and shedding the symbols of age (robes, beards, canes).
* Hidden Chamber
	* The pyramid is hollow (triangular, 20’x20’x30’) and conceals a hidden chamber containing an enormous soapstone heqeti pukel-mander (new items) which rests on the original stone floor of the complex.
		* The priests of Thoth found it here and build around it.
	* A one-way secret door allows return to the main chamber.

#### 3-11a: The Mouth of Thoth

* A magic mouth was placed on the south wall during the Archontean glory days.
	* Approaching within 15’ triggers the mouth, which speaks (secret tongue of the cult of Thoth): “Behold the Glory of Thoth! Mysteries of past, present and future are known to those who speak his name and direct his arms. Knowledge is power!”

#### 3-11b: Set’s Mouth

* Semi-recently, some priests of Set decided to mock the Mouth of Thoth with their own permanent magic mouth.
	* This mouth is also activated by anyone approaching within 15’ of its location, so there is a good chance anyone coming down the western passage from 3-12 activates both simultaneously.
	* The mouth appears sneering and contemptuous, announcing (Archontean): “The followers of the ibis are dead and gone; their power is faded and their secrets lost. Neither power nor knowledge is to be shared with the unworthy. Beware!”

### 3-12: Concealed Door, w/ access to 5-1

* A fresco (6' tall, 4' wide) of a baboon, squatting on the ground and staring forward with bared teeth covers the wall, worn but still recognizable.
	* If covers a secret door (+3 to detect).  Pressing both of the baboon’s eyes will cause the wall to grind inwards, revealing a staircase leading down 250’ to 5-1.

### 3-13: Trashed Chamber

* Holds a larger pile of trash than usual for this level: broken bits of wood, moldy pieces of plaster, several skulls and broken bones, broken pieces of metal, torn strips of cloth. 
	* 33% occupied: (d4) 1-2 giant rants, 3 scared adventurer, 4 giant fire beetles.
	* Lodged inside a skull (3-6 Turns of searching): a sapphire (1,500 gp)

### 3-14: False Corridor

* The wooden door from 3-2 leads to a short hallway, with a turn to the left ending in a false, trapped door.
	* Trap (covered pit): 20’ deep (2d6 dmg), triggered by opening the false door.

### 3-15: Thoth the Recorder

* The hallway from 3-2 is lined with frescoes
	* These show Thoth as an implacable ibis-headed scribe recording the virtues and sins of believers.  Around him numerous humans and demi-humans shout requests for mercy and favor.
* The second of the three major statues of Thoth stands in this intersection, atop an 8’-diameter circular pedestal of onyx that mostly blocks the center of the intersection.
	* The statue is an ibis-headed scribe, seated traditional Egyptian pose, using a quill to record the deeds of the dead on a book in his lap.
		* The ibis head, book, and quill are ivory.
		* The left hand holds the book down, while the right holds a quill pen.  The forearms of the statue rotate on stone pins (as in 3-2).
			* Each arm has 3 positions (thus 9 total combinations): down (default position, with hands holding pen and book); pointing straight ahead to the east, and up (above his head).
				* After 1 hour of inactivity, the arms reset to default (down-down) and all pits close.
		* The ibis head has no gemstones in it, merely 2" empty eye-holes (purposely designed to show the unfathomable and limitless nature of knowledge).
			* If staring into the eye-holes, become dazed for 1d4 rounds by the cosmic reach of Thoth’s knowledge.
	* Secret Door (west): opens with a catch concealed in the nostril of a fresco of Thoth; once released, the door slides into the south wall.

Arm Positions: Left Arm Right Arm Effect
* Down Down None (default position)
* Down Straight Opens pit at 3-15A
* Down Up Opens pit at 3-15B
* Straight Down Unlocks mechanism to secret door in 3-2C
* Straight Straight Opens chute at 3-15C
* Straight Up None
	* opens secret door to the west...oops!
* Up Down None
* Up Straight None
* Up Up Simultaneously opens both pits and the chute

#### 3-15a and 3-15b: Pit Trap

* This 10’x10’ by10'-deep spiked pit trap (2d6 dmg) opens when certain combinations of Thoth’s arms are ‘dialed’.

#### 3-15c: Chute

* Anyone standing in front of Thoth the Recorder (3-15) when either straight-straight or up-up is ‘dialed’ is dropped into a chute to 5-2.
	* The chute is a zig-zag tunnel of magically oiled stone.  Despite sliding more than 250’ down, it only deals 3d6 damage when unceremoniously dumped at the end.

## Level 3: 16 - 30

### 3-16: Halls of Thoth’s Beloved

* This darkened hallway is 15’ high, its walls filled with burial niches reserved for favored worshipers of the cult of Thoth.
	* Niches are 5’ long (two niches per 10’ length of hallway) and 3’ high (five niches from floor to ceiling)
		* Each originally had a stone plug on which family names and images of Thoth were painted.
			* All are smashed, except one in the northwest corner (3-16a).
			* A niche in the southern hall hides secret tomb entrance (3-17), 2-in-6 to notice the trash is disturbed.
		* The niches are mostly bereft of valuables.  Takes 8-12 hours to search them all, and each hour there is a 1-in-6 chance of finding something (see table).
	* The floor is littered with bits of masonry, bones, and general pieces of trash (difficult terrain, -10% move silent).
		* Searching finds 1d4 sp per hour (max 200 sp).
	* The halls slope downward noticably;  the western hall is 20' below the eastern hall.
	* A group of giant rats nests in the darkness of the southwest hallway corner.
		* They only attack a party that moves through their nesting area.
			* They leap from niches at head and chest level, getting +1 to surprise.

* Its plug covered with soot.  Cleaned, it shows...
	* An image of Thoth pointing straight forward with his left hand, while the right hand is at his side (a hint about that statues and opening 3-2a).
	* A symbol of the occupant's family: a black tower with a single window shining forth light into the darkness (still used by Krakteros, one of the Five Families).

  * The chamber is an elaborate burial chamber for two of the earliest Thoth worshipers.
	  *  Two basalt sarcophagi with burst lids occupy the center.
		  * Inscribed with scenes of humans worshiping Thoth and of baboons beating crocodiles with sticks. Incredibly heavy (500 lb each) finely carved (2,500 gp each).

		  * A stream of humans bringing goods to the feet of an orange-robed pair of Thoth priests, over whom looms another enormous ibis.
			  * The intention is simple: the devout followers of Thoth should prepare suitable donations to his priests. 
		  * Ibis-headed Thoth walks beside a woman bearing a white feather in her hand; to either side are sarcophagi.
			  * Thoth was associated with Maat, whose image was the white feather. A clue to the efficacy of the feathers of Maat found at 3-19 in repelling the undead of the catacombs (3-22).
		  * Ibis-headed Thoth holds the reins of a chariot in his outstretched left hand. At Thoth’s side is a rayed orb. The chariot travels through the sky, above adoring orange-clad priests.

4 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 13, 12, 11, 11, 10; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

### 3-18: Hall of Judges

* This oval chamber served as entry point to the main mortuary areas (at 3-21 and 3-22).
	* Four massive, imposing pillars carved into god statues 30' hold up a domed roof.
		* Each is a god of the dead: NE is Osiris (a bearded human with tall conical cap, holding two scepters across his chest), NW is jackal-headed Anubis holding a heart, SW is Ma'at (bearing a feather), and SE is ibis-headed Thoth holding a book.
	* Light may be glimpsed through the open archway to the north.
	* Frescoes depict the judgment of the dead and the rule of Osiris in the afterlife.

### 3-19: Feathers of Justice

* This chamber is brightly lit from continual light cast on the dais.
* All three walls are painted with brightly colored frescoes.
	* Each  shows a female deity (Maat) with an ostrich feather in her hair handing a feather to a small human worshipper. Other humans bear the feathers before them as they walk into a crypt. In the background is Thoth the recorder.
	* The upper register of each wall shows worshippers beseeching Maat with outstretched hands; the lower registers show demons, monsters and crocodiles.
	* In the center of the chamber is a white marble dais rising 3’ above the floor.  On top of the dais is a solid 10’x5’ onyx table.
		* Suspended in the air above the center of the table is a white ostrich feather.
			* It can easily be grasped; if removed from its place, another feather appears immediately.
			* They repel undead, though only within in the precincts of the temple of Thoth. A feather should be placed in the hair or carried in one’s outstretched hand.

		* Leather armor, 16 gp, 34 sp, 44 cp, potion of invisibility, potion of diminution.

### 3-21: Catacombs Entrance, w/ stairs up to 2-15

* This circular hall is the gateway for entering or leaving Thoth’s catacombs (3-22).
	* In the center of the room is a low dais out of which protrude three iron levers.
		* Each lever controls one portcullis (stiff; 5% per use of breaking).

		* The portcullises currently prevent the waking dead from infesting the rest of the complex.
	* The four curved sections of wall each feature the same image.
		* Ibis-headed Thoth presenting a scroll to woman carrying an ankh and wearing a headdress shaped like a throne (Isis).  Represents the belief that Thoth conveyed to Isis the secret words allowing resurrection of the dead.
	* Southern hallway:  leads to a long staircase rising 125’ to 2-15.

Southern lever has been broken off open (gate raised).

### 3-22: Catacombs of Thoth

* Lesser, but still honored, devotees of Thoth were buried in this twisting maze of passages.
	* The 15’-high corridors contain eight burial niches per 10’x15’ section of wall; these niches lack plugs and are thus open to the passages.
	* The niches contain bones, the occasional mummified corpse, and bits of lesser grave goods.
		* 1d4+2 Turns of searching exhausts a 10’-wide wall section, top to bottom. Each person-Turn searching gives a difficult (d8) Search check to find something (see table).
	* The walls and floors of the catacombs are remarkably free from dust and general trash (due to the gelatinous cube). 
* The dead in the Catacombs of Thoth do not rest easily.
	* 1d4 Turns after any living creatures have spent time in the Catacombs, and each Turn thereafter, the dead start waking.
		* Roll a type of undead and a distance they arise.
		* The waking of any undead is accompanied by a loud clatter and a thump.
	* Use of a feather of Maat (from 3-19, in hair or carried) prevents that person's presence from rousing the dead, but woken dead will still attack them if they are the best target.
* In the far west, there is a hole up to 3-113 into which the Set cultists sometimes dump garbage.
	* A rope ladder hangs down from the hole, but the bottom part has been dissolved by the cube.
		* Updates: the Setites have laid multiple heavy stone slabs over the hole down to the catacombs.
* A very old gelatinous cube roams these corridors.
	* It begins at "GC", near the garbage hole it frequents.  It is attracted by noise (like combat), and pursues intruders relentlessly.
	* If the portcullises at 3-21 be left ajar, the gelatinous cube should be added to the list of random encounters for Level 3.

* The halflings are aware of the undead in this region, but do not know of the cube. The Set cultists know of both the undead and the cube. The beastmen know of neither.

##### 3-22a: Stairs Down to SL12-20

* The secret door is difficult to detect from the catacombs (d8) side.
	* It is a 3'-square panel located within one of the burial niches.
	* It opens inward from the catacomb side (toward 3-22a) by pushing a 1/2”-diameter rod into a hole in the door.
		* Kerbog Khan’s automatons have such rods as part of their makeup to open the door to return to the workshops.
	* Stairs descend about 200’ before reaching SL12-20.
		* Halfway down the stairs is the corpse of a magic user; his spirit is now a wraith, which lurks on the ceiling.

### 3-23: Treasure Hoard

* This complex holds the hidden treasury of the cult of Thoth, undiscovered in the 1,200 years since the collapse of Arden Vul, and the amount of wealth and magic here is prodigious. 
	* When all three cult statues (3-2, 3-15, and 3-40) have their left arm parallel to the ground and right arm down, the statue at 3-2 slides back, revealing stone stairs leading down 20’ to a narrow tunnel. 
	* The tunnel is 5’ wide by 5’ tall and undecorated, at first seeming unimportant.
	* After an hour all three statues revert to their original, ‘start’ positions, and the statue at 3-2 glides back to cover the staircase.
	* An iron lever at the foot of the stairs allows those within the treasure chambers to force all three statues back into ‘open’ position.

##### 3-23a: Antechamber 

* The tunnel from 3-2 ends in a simple door covered with a fresco of an ibis.
	* Opening the door triggers a poison dart (1d3 damage plus save vs degraded poison; a failed save only causes 1d4 hours unconsciousness, awakening with 1 hp). 
* Inside is a guardian of Thoth (new). 

1 guardian of Thoth (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LN; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 3; HP 20; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: shriek. Special defenses: darkness 3/day.

* A statue of Thoth in blue marble with an alabaster ibis-head stands in the center of all the coins, brooding, hunched over with chin in both hands.
	* Two jet black gems gleam in the eye-sockets (1000 gp)
		* Impart a curse upon anyone (prier, holder, seller) who possesses them.  They will a) always be surprised in combat; and b) always lose initiative in combat.  it can be removed by a Remove Curse spell cast at 12th level or higher. 
* Secret Doors (northeast): Two of the staring baboon frescoes conceal secret doors which open when the eyes of the baboon are pressed simultaneously.

	* A wooden desk and chair occupy the center and gleam with a gold leaf veneer.
		- They crumble into dust if touched (bits of gold leaf remain, 150 gp, if carefully collected).

### 3-33: Floating Head

* A 2’-deep pile of trash completely covers the floor of this small side room.
	* Floating 5' above the junk is a life-sized, bronze bust.
		* It appears as a bearded man of noble mien, with empty eye sockets; his lips are pursed as if in the midst of speech.
		* A Sortian portable sage seized by imperial authorities in the last days of Arden-Vul.  The temple and archonal authorities lacked the command word and couldn't move the head, so it was abandoned here.
			* The command word is on the corpse found in 3-169.
			* Major Fields and sub-fields: Humankind (Archontean politics & genealogy) and Supernatural & Unusual (divination)
	* Underneath the pile of trash is a Thothian teleportation ring (address: YE-BL-GR-RE-BK-WH).  No activation squares are present. 

### 3-34: Scrutiny of Thoth

* The 15'-tall chamber is plastered, and features sixteen large (15’-tall by 5’-wide) images of ibis heads staring at the center of the chamber.
	* A continual light spell was cast here years ago, on a large bronze seal at the center of the ceiling (50 lbs, stoneshaped to hold it in position).
		* The seal is also a scrying amplifier (+1 to sense magic on things sitting on it, +20% to learn sphere and school, +2 to level to overcome target)
	* The sapphire-blue eyes of each ibis are painted such that each pair appears to be staring at the same point (marked X on the map).
		* The four ibis heads on the north wall flanking the door to 3-35 have peep holes about 5’ up (easily identified by anyone examining the fresco). 
	* There is a thick layer of dust, with grimalkin-sized footprints leading south (to 3-32) and west (through the door at 3-30).
* The bronze double-doors to the north are elaborately carved, with ibises, baboons, humans, scrolls, and strange objects.
	* There is a bronze keyhole on the right-most valve; from its size, the key must be very large (8 inches or more) (held by the Set deacon in 3-89a).
	* The doors are locked, and stuck (hard to pick, -10%, and Difficult).

lock picked!

### 3-35: Hall of Scrutiny

* A former guard post and administrative facility, this chamber prevented unauthorized access to the secrets found to the east (3-40, 3-45).
	* The plastered walls are a peaceful aqua green.
	* The bronze double doors (3-34) on the south wall are locked (the key is in 3-89a).

### 3-36 Tomb of Hithra Paleologos

##### 3-36a: Tomb of Hithra Paleologos: Hidden Vestibule

* At the very tip of the chasm, concealed behind the spiders’ webs (3-37), is a concealed door leading to a narrow passage of simple granite, roughly shaped.
* At the end is a small chamber, devoid of furnishings, with a 7’-diameter hole in the floor.
	* It leads down 25’ to the ancient and deadly tomb of Hithra Paleologos.
	* Scrawled on the wall behind the hole (Mithric) “Danger! Do not Pass!” and more recently (Archontean) “Return with the Fruits of Lord Priscus’s Wisdom before further Exploration.”

##### 3-36b: Tomb of Hithra Paleologos: Tiled and Trapped Entrance

* The hole from 3-36a drops into a cramped triangular chamber sheathed in 1”-square orange and purple tiles.
	* In 18 locations on the walls, the tiles are arranged in patterns of 64 alternating squares (i.e., a chessboard). Many of the tiles are inscribed with runes representing traditional Archontean chess pieces.
		* Each board has a different arrangement of pieces, but on all 18 boards, the pieces are arranged so that an orange High Priest will take a purple Sorcerer and thus enable an orange Legionary to place the purple archon into checkmate.
			* It takes expertise in chess, or a roll of 3d8 under INT to recognize this fact. 
* The door on the west wall (to 3-36c) is 5’-diameter circle made of blue granite.
	* The door is magically barred with hold portal (cast by a 12th-level mage).
		* Any touching it casually receive a jolt of magical force for 1-3 damage.
		* Touches the glyphs in the wrong order deals 1d6 per failed attempt (resetting after an hour).
	* Several inscriptions and images appear on the door.
		* At the top of the circular plug are a pair of orange, heavily-lidded eyes which appear to stare at visitors.
		* Just below the phrase is incised with gold fill into the stone (Mithric): “Hithra the Paleologos Rests Within. Visitors are Unwanted.”
		* Below the inscription are two rows of five glyphs; the top row of glyphs glows with orange light, while the bottom row glows with purple light.
			* The glyphs in each row depict, in order, 
				* a rod of command (Archon = king), 
				* a sinuous winged serpent (Dragon = queen), 
				* a robed figure making a blessing (High Priest = bishop), 
				* a robed figure performing an incantation (Sorcerer = knight), and 
				* Cataphract (rook)
				* a gladius (Legionary = pawn). 
		* The glyphs must be touched in the proper sequence for the door to open: orange High Priest, purple Sorcerer, orange Legionary, purple Archon.

##### 3-36c: Tomb of Hithra Paleologos: Main Tomb

* The star-shaped tomb is brightly lit by a continual light spell; it's walls are white marble and its floor is particolored marble.
	* The central 20’x20’ section of floor resembles a chessboard: 2.5’-square tiles of alternating orange and purple marble.
		* Brightly painted, 3’-tall terracotta game pieces in the Archontean style stand in their home positions on each side of the board.
	* 5’-diameter stone doors occupy the three truncated points of the star.
	* In the center of the board, lying between the two sets of pieces, stands a 6’x4’x4’ stone bier atop which rests a corpse dressed in the orange ceremonial robes of Thoth. The entire area radiates magic, and, from the bier, evil.
		* The corpse is not Hithra Paleologos (who rests in 3-36e), but a skeleton warrior,  Kalifer, bound by Hithra and languishing here for more than a millennium.
* Secret Door (southwest): normal to detect, but opens only when the purple Archon chess piece is destroyed.

Chess Trap
* Each chess piece is beautifully shaped and painted, and is hollow and fairly fragile.
	* Within each is a huge pearl (1,000 gp each, 32 in all) and a quantity of fine powder.
		* Each type of piece has a different powder, and if broken spreads a 10’-radius cloud.
	* Archon (=king, Poison save at +4 or die)
	* Dragon (= queen, Paralysis: save at +2 or be held for 1 turn)
	* High Priest (bishop, Sleep: save at +2)
	* Sorcerer (knight, Confusion: save at +4)
	* Cataphract (=rook, Choking: save at -1 or -3 to all rolls)
	* Legionary (=pawn, Obscuring: save or -1 to all rolls, vision obscured to 10’)
* If any chess piece is moved to another square on the board...
	* A volley of 8 steel darts fire from the ceiling at random squares on the board.
		* Each dart is aimed at a different square, and unerringly hits whatever is there (adventurers for preference over chess pieces).  A dart hitting a piece shatters it.  Hitting a creature, it deals 1d4 damage.
		* The magazine holds 96 darts total (12 volleys of 8).
	* The stone doors to areas 3-36d swing open, releasing their inhabitants.
* Chess pieces may be removed from the board entirely without triggering the trap.
	* Both the inhabitants of 3-36d and Kalifer know of the powders and will certainly take the time to destroy pieces adjacent to them in combat; they may also (50%) elect to spend a combat round specifically destroying 1-3 pieces.

Kalifer
* Kalifer is aware as soon as the chamber is entered, but waits, unmoving, to take the intruder's measure. 
* He desperately and single-mindedly desires the return of the golden circlet with which Hithra bound him, and all his actions are directed towards this end.
* How he reacts depends on what the intruders do:
	* Intruders poke or otherwise disturb his body: Kalifer attacks
	* Intruders activate guardians in areas 3-36d by moving chess pieces to new squares: Kalifer bides his time
	* Intruders take no action within 2 turns, or appear exceptionally cautious and/or intelligent: Kalifer sits up and negotiates with intruders for their assistance in obtaining his circlet
* Kalifer is immune to the powders, so in combat smash open as many pieces as possible.

Kalifer, a skeleton warrior: SZ M; AL N(E); AC 0; MV 60’; HD 9+2; HP 66; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10 (two-handed sword); MR 90%. Special attacks: +3 to hit; cause fear. Special defenses: cannot

* Possessions: Kalifer’s sword (see new magic items); earring of protection +2 (new).

(Possibly): creatures from 3-36D

##### 3-36d: Tomb of Hithra Paleologos: Side Chambers

* The doors to these three triangular chambers are 5’-diameter circular plugs of stone, each locked. 
	* If any chess pieces in 3-36c are moved to a different square on the board, all three doors open and the Archontean animated constructs (chessmen) (new) attack.
		* In combat, the chessmen may (50% per round) destroy 1-3 of the terra cotta pieces instead of striking a living opponent.
	* If the doors are picked open, it reveals three identical chambers of natural stone, each holding a 4’-tall stone chessman (each the High Priest).

3 Archontean animated constructs – chessmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 6; HP 45, 39, 35; #AT 1; Dmg 4-11; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons. 

##### 3-36e: Tomb of Hithra Paleologos: Secret Tomb and Treasury

* The secret door from 3-36C leads to a small chamber.
	* The body of Hithra Paleologos rests on a 3’-tall stone bier.
		* Next to the body stands an elaborate gold and opal goblet (250 gp), from which Hithra sipped the poison that ended his long life.
		* Hithra wears the orange silk robes of a high priest of Thoth, but instead of his cylindrical headdress of office, he wears a golden circlet inset with huge emeralds (the control circlet for Kalifer the skeleton warrior in 3-36c). 
		* His desiccated left hand bears a large, gaudy, silver poison ring with an immense topaz (650 gp). A secret compartment behind the topaz contains two doses of lethal poison.
		* Hithra’s right hand clutches a rudishva useful palm (size adjustment; new) with 3 charges.
		* Despite what intruders may fear, Hithra’s body remains inanimate.
	* On one side of the bier is a low wooden bookcase, rotted with age.
		* In it rest a dozen notebooks, each labeled “Games and Strategies of Hithra the Paleologos, vol. 1 to 12”.
	* On the other side are 3 heavy and large alabaster jars (500 gp each, 70 lbs).
		* Jar 1: 8,000 ancient silver pennies. Mixed in among them is a silver ankh-key.
		* Jar 2: 4,000 ancient gold solidi, and a dozen rubies (500-6,000 gp each).
		* Jar 3: six potions in a leather carrying case (climbing, heroism, healing, fire resistance, human control, sweet water), a Thothian passkey, a mace +2, a suit of chain mail +2.

Chess Notes
* These volumes contain detailed notes and moves from scores of chess games that Hithra played over a period of 40 years, all of which took place about 1,200 years ago in the period when the city and temples of Arden Vul fell into chaos.
	* He doodles observations of the growing chaos, the Theosophs and Sortians in the margins as he details the much more important games.
* Volume 12 is devoted to games against “Kel Bormol the Overseer, that cheating, untrustworthy snake!.”
	* The last 10 games versus Kel Bormol are all losses, and the final entry includes a few frustrated notes: “He anticipates my every move! He must be cheating! We shall see how he likes a dose of my Useful Palm! I will offer to play him in his chambers above the Great Hall, and will even let him play orange for once. Let him attempt to cheat the Paleologos once more! He shall regret it ….”
	* GM Note: reference to Hithra’s betrayal of his sometime friend, Kel Bormol (SL3-2A).

### 3-37: Spiders from Above

* The northwest point of the Great Chasm (3-38) is the lair of some spiders who have woven a web about about 20’ above the level of the dungeon floor.
	* The nest includes six spiders, five huge and one giant.
	* They roam throughout the chasm and any caves accessible from it; adventurers are likely to encounter only some of the spiders at any given time:
		* d6: 2 huge spiders (1), 3 huge spiders (2), 4 huge spiders (3), 1 giant spider (4), 1 giant spider and 2 huge spiders (5), the whole nest! (6)
	* In webbing: 110 gp in two belt pouches, a white opal worth 200 gp, a potion of frost cage (new), and a scroll with 3 magic user spells (magic missile, sleep, ray of enfeeblement).

### 3-38: The Great Chasm

* One of the iconic features of the Halls, this massive fissure extends through most of the dungeon levels.
	* The fissure is generally shaped like a triangular prism, with its apex about 50’ above Level 2. The triangular prism extends downward 1,600’ through the Halls until it levels out at the floor of the chasm (9-1) many hundreds of feet below.
* From Level 3 it requires some careful spelunking to traverse the chasm upwards or downwards; ropes, pitons, and/or fly spells.
	* Lower down the chasm (e.g., 5-34) the prevalence of cave vines, creepers, and lichen mats provides some assistance to such ventures, but at this height plant life is relatively rare. 
* On Level 3 use the Upper Zone encounter table; rolling every 3 turns, 1-in-6 chance of an encounter.

### 3-39: Tomb of Artax-Ris

* The wall of the chasm here is covered with creepers (benign) which conceal the opening to this tomb (detect as concealed).
* The entrance is a circular stone, 10’ in diameter.
	* On it is carved the rudishva glyph for protection, along with some rough letters (Archontean): “Artax-Ris does not wish to be disturbed.”
	* Depressing the protection glyph causes the entire disk of stone will roll to the right, opening the tunnel into the tomb.
		* Touching the glyph with flesh or metal triggers an electric discharge (3d6 damage), 20' radius.  Cloth or other material is safe to use.
		* After 1 hour the disk will grind shut.
* Both the entrance and the tomb are 20’ tall.
	* The entrance hallway and inner chamber are each tiled with 6”-square lapis lazuli tiles, lacking the usual Archontean / Thothian motifs.
	* Each tile has a golden bead in its center, the beads reflect any illumination in an almost blinding way. 
* The 10’-long entrance passageway holds four desiccated skeletons.
	* Two are ancient Thothian priests.
		* 2 silver holy symbols of Thoth (15 gp each).
	* The other two are of more recent adventurers.
		* A suit of scale mail, long sword +1, 35 sp, 45 gp, a potion of healing.
* The entrance hall opens into a 20’x15’ chamber.
	* Some of the lapis tiles on the east wall had their golden beads removed, and a crude inscription is painted across them (Mithric) “Do not disturb Lord Artax-Ris. The Prior forbids it.”
	* Under the inscription is a large stone chair, too big for humans (just right for giant rudishva skeletons).
	* In the middle of the chamber is a strange ‘sarcophagus’ 8’ long and 4’ wide
		* It is made of orange material that is very hard and very shiny (plasteel), with a clear glass (i.e., plasglass) lid.  An unusual clasp holds the lid shut.
		* Within rests Artax-Ris, now a giant rudishva skeleton.
			* It clutches a large two-handed sword; and other goods can be seen inside.
				* 1,122 ancient gold solidi, 3,478 ancient copper bits, a ring of levitation (new), a staff of blue light (new) wrapped in blue silk; two scrolls (wizard lock, slow), boots of springing and striding
			* If the clasp of the sarcophagus is opened, Artax-Ris springs up, ready to defend his meager hoard. He shouts (guttural Rudishva): “Who bothers lord Artax-Ris? Leave now or die!” 
		* The sarcophagus is a rudishva hyperbaric chamber, powered by a greater power supply built into the device.
			* Examination of the underside reveals Rudishva glyphs and an access panel from which the power supply can be removed.

* Development: If ‘awakened’ but not slain, Artax-Ris decides to leave his chamber, using his ring to levitate down to area 5-35.
	* He seeks other rudishva (giant skeletal ones or actual survivors). He may set himself up as a tyrant over the goblins, commandeering area 5-46 from Killik while contemplating how to gather allies so as to reassume his rightful status over the varumani (e.g., at 5-54).
* GM Note: Artax-Ris survived the heqeti attack.  The plague was slowly killing him, but he spurned the elven transformation, instead experimenting with Psalor-Ki (5-74) using the hyperbaric chambers.  Believing he could modulate the effects and save his life (Psalor-Ki vehemently disagreed), he stole a chamber, fled here, and carried out his doomed work.

Artax-Ris, intelligent giant rudishva skeleton: SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%. Special attacks: bone throwing; sonic blast. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from sharp or edged weapons; half damage from fire; immune to sleep, charm, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### 3-40: Thoth, the Knower of Secrets

* Covered passage (southwest): led to 3-4, filled with rubble, bricked up, and plastered over in antiquity.  Detect as secret door.
* A narrow, 3.5'-wide stone bridge spans the chasm with a slight arch.
	* If fighting on the bridge, roll DEX vs 4 to balance and avoid falling into the chasm.
* The chamber is 30’ tall and unlit, with sconces on the north and east walls.
	* A massive, 15’-tall image carved from solid basalt shows squatting, baboon-headed Thoth (as Aani, who sits on the soul-weighing scales against the feather of Maat).
	* The images on the walls are hermetic, dealing with strange, gnostic principles and magical knowledge.
		* Human forms are largely absent, but moons of all phases, baboons, ibises, pentagrams, circles, and numbers in talismanic sequences are ubiquitous. 
	* The floor is dusty, but clear of trash.
	* Firelight may be visible from 3-4, if the grimalkin still occupy that room.
	* The northwest corner holds a tangle of spider webs.
		* Noise and light in this room may attract the spiders from 3-37.
	* In the northeast corner huddles the crushed skeleton of an adventurer.
		* Dagger, rotted purse (26 pp), rotted backpack w/ spellbook (Cleophalus’s look-away spell (new), comprehend languages, floating disk, jump, read magic, shield).
* There are three normal doors, one north and two east.
	* They are magically held (hold portal 18th-level), openable via the statue of Thoth.
	* They open normally from the opposite side.

Statue of Thoth the Gnostic
* Thoth squats with knees drawn up to chest.  His arms are bent so paws/hands rest on his knees.  Eyes are painted in a life-like manner.
* This is the third of the great statues of Thoth on Level 3 which (along with 3-2 and 3-15), serves reveal the secret tunnel to 3-23.
	* The arms rotate separately from down ("knee", on lap), to forward ("raised", before him), to up ("eyes", covering eyes with back of hand, like See No Evil).
		* The arms both reset to down after 1 hour.

Left Arm Right Arm Effect
* Knee Knee None (default position)
* Knee Raised Opens concealed door to 3-40a
* Knee Eyes Opens door to 3-41
* Raised Knee Helps open secret passage at 3-2c
* Raised Raised Opens concealed door to 3-40b
* Raised Eyes Opens door leading to 3-42
* Eyes Knee Casts continual darkness centered on the statue
* Eyes Raised Opens concealed door to 3-40c
* Eyes Eyes Opens door to hallway, just north of 3-40c

##### 3-40a, 3-40b, 3-40c: Cells of the Guardians

* Each bare cell contains a re-spawning guardian designed to protect the secrets of the tombs of Thoth.
	* Each has a concealed door panel which slides into the ceiling when the proper combination of Thoth’s arms are ‘dialed’ at area 3-40.
	* The image on each door differs
		* 3-40a features a crescent moon shining down on an ibis
		* 3-40B depicts a baboon clubbing a crocodile
		* 3-40C depicts a single blue eye
	* When opened a guardian of Thoth is summoned to that cell and released.
		* If defeated, another can be summoned (in the same fashion) after 1 hour. If a guardian is inactive for 1 hour, it is banished.

3 guardians of Thoth (new): SZ M; AL LN; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 3; HP 22, 20, 18; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: shriek 3/day. Special defenses: darkness 3/day.
* shriek: 50' radius, mortals save vs transform or disoriented d4 rounds (can't attack or cast, but can flee)
* magical darkness doesn't block darkvision?  doesn't say anything about it in spell

### 3-41: Ancient Tombs

* Three sarcophagi occupy this ornately decorated burial chamber. 
	* The inhabitants were important priests of Thoth, honored with a burial next to the cult image in 3-40.
	* The frescos are largely intact but faded by time. Priests genuflect at the feet of a seated baboon, whose the left arm points forward (a hint to the puzzle at 3-2).
* Opening any sarcophagus lids triggers the sand trap.
	* A hidden catch on the floor near the left-most sarcophagus can disable it.
	* Sand pours from three 5’-diameter holes in the ceiling (marked with Xs) and completely fills the chamber in 6 rounds.
		* Round 1: normal movement
		* Round 2-5: roll 4d6+(rounds-2) under Dex to successfully move.
	* Access to 3-41A via the ceiling holes requires the sand-trap be triggered, and 1-4 hours of sand removal has reopened enough of the room.
* Sarcophagi: each contains an inanimate mummy. Inside each mummy is a piece of elaborate jade jewelry (500-3,000 gp) and a black pearl (325 gp).

##### 3-41a: Tomb of Menas the Logothete, with access to 8-34

* The tomb of Menas lies above chamber 3-41.
	* It is accessible through the 5’-diameter holes in the ceiling of 3-41 once the sand has been drained and 1d4 hours spent clearing it enough to reach the holes.
* Menas’s tomb is 10’ tall and richly decorated with frescoes showing Thoth in all his forms – ibis, baboon, sky-chariot driver, etc, particularly vibrant due to the sand's protection.
	* The largest fresco is centered on the south wall above Menas’s sarcophagus; an enormous ibis streaming rays of energy. Above the fresco are words from the Litany of Light (Mithric) “The Gift of Thoth to the Faithful” (see 2-3 and the Litany of Light in books)).
* Four 2'-tall oval daises daises protrude from the west, north and east walls.
	* Attached to the walls above them are large sheets of slate (2' wide x 6' tall).
* Dominating the tomb is the massive granite sarcophagus of Menas (8’ long, 4’ wide, 4’ tall), also on a 2’-tall oval dais (magically held shut, 18th level).
	* Inscribed on the front (short) end is an image of a Thothian priest in robes and cylindrical headdress, along with the name ‘Menas the Logothete’.
	* Attached to the lid is another sheet of slate.
* A basin attached to the south wall still holds sand (from the trap)
	* At the bottom are several pieces of chalk.
* Door (north): magically held (18th level), unsealing along with the sarcophagus.
	* If approached from 8-34 before the sand is drained, opening the doors causes an avalanche of sand (see 8-34).
	* Leads to an undecorated corridor and a very long stair to the Nether Reaches (8-34).

Opening the Sarcophagus
* One must print the letters of one of two words on the slates in the chamber (one letter per slate), either "LIGHT" or "MAGIC", upon which the sarcophagus lid slides open.
	* One can start and end the word on any combination of slates.
	* These are the gifts provided by Thoth to humans.
* Within, beside the desiccated (and inert) mummy of Menas are his grave goods.
	* 2,345 ancient silver pennies, 459 ancient gold solidi.
	* The legendary thieves’ mask (new).

* Three sarcophagi occupy this ornately decorated burial chamber. 
	* The inhabitants were important priests of Thoth, honored with a burial next to the cult image in 3-40.
	* The frescos are largely intact but faded by time. Priests genuflect at the feet of a seated baboon, whose the left arm points forward (a hint to the puzzle at 3-2).
* Opening any sarcophagus lids triggers its dart trap.
	* A hidden catch on the west wall across from each sarcophagus disables its trap (1-in-8 to spot the first, then 1-in-4 for the others).
	* Opening a sacrophagus triggers a volley of 6 darts from it's X mark (+5 atk, probably with surprise), each dealing 1d2 damage and save vs Doom against black lotus powder poison (paralysis for 3d4 Turns, or 1d4 rounds on success).
* Sarcophagi: each contains an inanimate mummy. Inside each mummy is a piece of elaborate jade jewelry (50-500 gp) and a garnet (125 gp).

### 3-43: Still More Ancient Tombs

* Three sarcophagi occupy this ornately decorated burial chamber. 
	* The inhabitants were priests of Thoth, honored with a burial next to the cult image in 3-40.
	* The frescos are largely intact but faded by time. Priests genuflect at the feet of an impassive human with a cylindrical headdress whose left arm points forward (a hint to the puzzle at 3-2).
	* The floor is dotted with 3/4”-diameter holes, readily visible.
	* Two adventurer skeletons huddle, multiply pierced, before the western sarcophagus.
		* 2 rusted suits of chain mail, shield +1, two maces, a scroll (magic mouth), purse with 26 ancient silver pennies and a cursed penny (new).
* Opening any sarcophagus lids triggers the spear trap.
	* A hidden catch on the east wall near the right-most sarcophagus can disable it.
	* Iron spears stab up through the floor holes. Anyone in the chamber is struck by 1d3+1 spears (+5 atk, possible surprise) dealing 1d4 damage.  (Spear hits x 5)% chance that their poison is still potent (save vs Doom or die).
* Sarcophagi: each contains an inanimate mummy. Inside each mummy is a piece of elaborate jade jewelry (50-500 gp) and a garnet (125 gp).

### 3-44: Magic Fountain

* In the center of the room is a 5’-diameter and 3’-tall basin, with a crouching marble baboon at its center, pouring clear liquid from his mouth.
	* This circular hall is brightly lit with a continual light spell.
	* The water was protective magic, but has grown more chaotic over the centuries.

### 3-45: Hall of Mysteries

* A balustraded balcony overlooks the Hall of Mysteries.  The hall lies 15’ below and is accessible via a set of stone stairs.
* Along the eastern and western sides of the chamber are giant 15’-tall statues of the old deities standing in classic pose - left foot advancing, hands by their sides, and with traditional symbolic headdresses.
	* East: lion-headed Sekhmet, Set (in Set-Animal form), and jackal-headed Anubis
	* West: Osiris, Horus and Isis.
* On the north wall is a larger (25’-tall) statue of Thoth in his ibis-headed form.
	* One of its 2’-diameter eyes is empty.

* 2 rounds after someone descends the stairs, one of three mysteries will take place (d3).
	* 1 Thoth, the Silver Light
	* 2 Thoth, the Wise Arbiter
	* 3 Thoth, the Source of Magic

Thoth as the Silver Light:
* The statues of Set and Horus advance into the center of the chamber, where Set jabs a spear into Horus’s eye.
* A 2’-diameter, 2”-thick silver disk (representing the moon) rolls out of Horus’s head and clatters to the ground.
* The ritual is completed if the PCs advance, pick up the silver disk, and insert it into the empty eye socket in the statue of Thoth.
	* If accomplished, Thoth emits brilliant silver light curing all diseases and healing all wounds of those within the chamber.
* If not recovered within 1 Turn, the Set Statue crushes the disk under foot, causing an , earsplitting clap of thunder and 2d6 damage to all in the room.
* The eye is restored in 2 days and the mystery can be replayed.
 
Thoth, the Wise Arbiter:
* Osiris and Sekhmet advance and begin to strike each other with their massive stone fists. 
	* Chips of stone fly for several rounds, then Thoth commands (Mithric): “Halt!”
	* The statues stop in mid assault, and Osiris drops his flail to the floor.
	* Thoth intones “One with wisdom must choose!”
		* If someone picks up the flails, the lion-head of Sekhmet comes to life and attacks them (Archontean animated construct).  Their companions are magically held for the length of the combat.
			* If they die, Thoth again shouts “Halt!” and they are revived, but lose 5 HP permanently.  If they prevail, Thoth grants them +3 HP permanently.
	* After Thoth’s judgment, the statues return to their positions.
		* A victor may keep the flail (flail +1) and a new one will appear in Osiris’s hand. If defeated, the flail returns to Osiris’s hand.
	* A person can only receive the blessing once, but the fallen can try again repeatedly.

Thoth, the Source of Magic:
* Set and Isis advance into the room. Isis opens a cavity in her abdomen, and places a small (8”-tall) ebony statuette of Osiris on the floor.  Set shatters Osiris with his axe into 15 pieces. A wall of force seals the chamber.
* Set then coughs forth 3 giant snakes which attack all in the room. Thoth shouts, in Mithric: “Isis must restore him, but only I can revive him!” 
* The statue must be reassembled and re-inserted inside Isis.
	* 2 rounds per piece (30 rounds total). Each assistant reduces the total by 5 rounds (e.g. 3 people take 20 rounds).
	* Every 10 rounds, another giant snake emerges.
	* Once reinstalled inside Isis, a slip of parchment floats from Thoth’s mouth (Mithric) “With knowledge I prevail.”  Reciting it aloud causes Set to retreat, any remaining snakes to crumble to dust, and the wall of force to disappear.
	* The statuette of Osiris turns to solid gold (5,000 gp, 100 lb).
		* Each repetition of the mystery produces a statue one substance more common (silver, 5000 sp, copper 5000 cp, bronze 100 gp, wood 50 gp).

Archontean animated construct - stone Sekhmet lion (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 3-8; HP varies; #AT 3; Dmg 1-6/1-6/1-10; MR 25%.

### 3-46: Larel One-Eye

* Relics of the legendary hero Larel One-Eye (see Tales of Larel One-Eye in Arden Vul books) rest in this chamber.
	* Larel is a figure of legend and one of the Worthies of the ancient Archontean empire, whose exploits have been spun into a series of moralizing folk-tales emphasizing the value of wit and good cheer over force. These tales are still told in some form in the Archontean Empire today.
	* Larel is most commonly depicted as a short, pudgy man with ginger hair in a pudding-bowl style, green eyes, and a red eye-patch.
	* His iconic items are his sack, from which he drew myriad useful items, his thin dagger "Larel's Pin", and his humble grey cloak, patched with a variety of colorful patches.
* The chamber is decorated on the north wall with an enormous fresco of Larel wearing a green cap and patched cloak, carrying a sack over his shoulder, with his dagger at his side. 
* The other walls feature scenes from his famous tales:
	* Larel producing a chicken from his sack to distract wolves.
	* Larel using his cloak as a quilt to conceal himself from an angry husband.
	* Larel cleverly spiking four apples on his dagger while distracting the innkeeper with a card trick.
	* Larel absconding from the castle of the wizard Tilgo with the latter’s spell book in his sack.
* Relics of Larel are draped across various racks in the center of the chamber.
	* A cloak rack contains three cloaks: a fine blue wool one (25 gp), a simple black linen cloak, and a ratty patched cloak of many colors (Larel’s cloak, new).
	* A small rack of various weapons, including six fine-but-wicked-looking daggers, 3some curvy, some with gold handles, others bejeweled (110 gp total).
	* A writing desk with a gold apple (35 gp), a plain silver ‘letter opener’ (actually Larel’s Pin, new), and three fairly explicit love notes in Mithric from Larel to three aristocratic women of Archontos (20 gp each to collectors).
	* An unlocked oak chest contains a variety of fine clothing (20 gp), 3 leather belt pouches, a purple silk purse with a gold-thread drawstring (25 gp), and a green stocking cap.
		* Stuffed into the cap is a brown sack (Larel’s sack, new).
	* In the center of the chamber is a stone pedestal, on which is a capped pewter urn filled with ashes - allegedly those of Larel.
* All the "relics" detect as magical.  Larel's true relics don't (except to a 9th level caster or better).
	* If the PCs come away with the true relics, they will undoubtedly draw attention from thieves and others who might wish to possess the relics of Larel.

Larel's Ashen Urn
* If the cap is removed (e.g. to see what’s inside), Larel's invisible spirit manifests.
	* It attempts to possess the one with the greatest combined WIS and CHA (save vs Spells w/ -3). If unsuccessful, it makes one more attempt on the next highest combination of WIS and CHA.
	* If successful, Larel causes the subject to act mischievously, particularly by poking fun at, or humbling, the mighty.
		* If the ashes are desecrated, the spirit maliciously works to cause major bad luck and misfortune.  Otherwise, it causes only minor mischief.
		* Over time Larel’s spirit will cause the possessed to exhibit wanderlust, regular lust, and increasing disregard for all authority.
		* It may be difficult to detect the possession, and only exorcism by a high priest (at a cost of 9,000 gp) will rid the possessed of the spirit.  If exorcised, Larel’s spirit returns to the urn, wherever it happens to be. 

### 3-47: Spiral Stair up to 2-46

* This granite stairway climbs 125’ to 2-46.
	* Numerous cobwebs and an abandoned backpack halfway down the staircase.
		* 10 iron spikes, 3 torches, 2 flasks of oil, an everfull purse (resets to 15 sp, 15 gp every night).

### 3-48: Jaken the Proud

* The tomb of Jaken the Proud, a famous spearman and companion of the heroes Arden and Vul.
	* A series of water-stained frescoes shows scenes from Jaken’s legendary adventures: skewering a giant bipedal salamander, casting a spear at a flying globe of yellow light, riding a beast (unclear due to water damage), holding up Arden’s cloak, drinking a hornful of beverage, etc.
		* Jaken is identifiable by his tall, plumed, conical helmet, his heavy boar-spear, and his scarlet banded mail.
	* Jaken’s tomb is an elaborate marble block.
		* Carved with struggling warriors on all four sides and an image of a supine Jaken is carved on the lid, carrying his helmet and spear.
		* The lid is well balanced, and slides off easily.
		* Inside are:
			* The alleged relics of Jaken the Proud, including his conical helmet, heavy spear and red armor (all extremely shiny and polished, 75 gp)
				* No wear and tear, looks newer than the bones.  Actually a set of ancient copies, made by the priests of Thoth for show in promoting the cult of the great hero.
				* The equipment looks impressive, detects as magic, but is just ornamental and has a 10% cumulative chance of breaking per use.
			* A small (30”x8”x12”) ivory coffer (45 gp) containing an incomplete set of very old, tarnished, and charred set of bones (Jaken's).
				* Detect as magical.  If carried before you, grant Protection from Evil 10’ radius. 
				* May be used to contact Jaken’s spirit: he is bluff and martial, but not stupid.  He speaks only Mithric and knows nothing of the Halls, but is well-versed in ancient history, mythology, and tactics.

### 3-49: Pit of Fire

* A large, 20’-diameter pool (1'-"deep") of fire sits in the center of this 20’-tall room.
	* The walls are covered with flaking plaster painted orange, an effect which magnifies the effect of the fire.
	* The pit is rimmed with a 1’-tall lip of marble.  The fire leaps and crackles to a height of 8’ above it.
		* The top of the lip is inscribed with obscure mystical symbols.
			* Read Mage / Sage: “The fire of Truth cleanses the mind and transports the body of those faithful who proclaim that Thoth Reigns Triumphant!”
	* A large golden key is easily visible in the center of the pit.
	* The fire pit is inhabited by a fire elemental, who can be glimpsed by those who spend several rounds gazing at the fire.
	* Entering the fire deals 3d6 damage and the elemental may freely attack all present.
* If one speaks “Thoth Reigns Triumphant” (any language), they can safely enter the flame.
	* Doing so, the elemental will allow them to take the key and speaks telepathically: “Thoth values your love. Do you wish to be cleansed or to be transported?”
		* Thinking or saying “cleansed”: granted a gift (cure of all damage and removal of all curses and afflictions), permanent +1 Int, or seven tattoo icons appear, each can be triggered for a day of 20% magic resistance).
			* Cleansing can only be gained once, ever.
		* Thinking or saying “transported”: they and those who follow after them are transported immediately to the legendary City of Brass on the plane of fire.
			* May be used repeatedly.
* Secret Door (south): difficult to spot.; opens with the fire pool key; opens inwards.

1 fire elemental: SZ L; AL N; AC 2; MV 120’; HD 12; HP 79; #AT 1; Dmg 3-24. Special attacks: combustion. Special defenses: +2 weapons or better to hit.

### 3-50: Priscian Antechamber 

* The chamber is barrel-vaulted and 15’ tall. Two 3’-tall ledges run across the north and south walls, atop of which stand granite statutes of kilted spearmen.
	* The floor of the passage between the ledges boasts three impressive mosaics, each featuring a blue knot (Sortian knot).
	* The statues are Archontean animated constructs (spearmen; new), which animate whenever a being traverses the passage.
		* Intruders have 1 round to show a Sortian eye (new) of any type or be attacked.
* Occupying the east wall is an 8’-tall carving of a distinguished, late middle-aged male human face with crew cut, trim beard, piercing eyes, wrinkles, a few blemishes, and empty eye sockets.
	* The generic image of the Philosopher, similar to a Sortian face (new), but mundane, not magical.
* Secret Door (north): easy (1 in 4) to locate from this side. It opens by a hidden catch and pushing the door into 3-49.  Not locked from this side.

6 enhanced Archontean animated constructs - spearmen (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 60’; HD 8; HP 61, 58, 55, 53, 50, 49; #AT 1; Dmg 5-10; MR 25%. Special defenses: immune to elemental magic, poison, and mind-affecting spells; +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from slashing or piercing weapons. These constructs are slightly more powerful than the run-of-the-mill variety.

##### 3-50a: Stairs Up to AV-19

* This narrow staircase rises 350’ through several landings to the basement of a ruined palace in the city of Arden Vul (AV-19).

##### 3-50b: Stairs Down to 6-49a

* This 5’-wide staircase descends 850’ through multiple landings and switchbacks to 6-49a.
	* The stairs show signs of recent traffic (booted feet). 

### 3-51: Cavern and Monolith

* * An aura of evil hangs over the cavern like a damp mist; it is easily detectable by magic and will be manifested by a sense of prickling skin and of looming, unseen menace.
* This large cave contains a 10’-square monolith which rises 150’ to Level 2 (2-48).
	* Carved of the native granite of the cavern, but with some strange textural features.
	* Touched with bare flesh, the stone feels greasy and appears to leave a filmy residue on the skin that touches it.  This effect is psychosomatic, but lingers for hours.
	* The monolith appears to be polished, lacking the usual grain of natural stone.
	* Strange cursive runes are incised in the monolith in apparently random patterns, filled with a red substance that appears liquid, but is in fact solid.
		* If a rune is touched by anyone who not Chaotic Evil, they take 1d6 damage and the rune brands itself on a visible portion of their body (face, neck, arm, hand).
			* Each brand drains 1 Con / month and cause a -3 to CHA or reaction rolls.
			* Each requires a Remove Curse to remove it.
	* The top of the monolith is a flattened triangle, described at 2-48.
* The cave floor is littered with a scattering of bones, mostly human, but some humanoid and monstrous.
	* Sorting through the bones may turn up something useful:

D12 Object
1-3 a piece of non-magical armor
4-5 a non-magical metal weapon
6-9 a random piece of adventuring gear
10 a gemstone of 5 gp value
11 a scroll case, containing:
	1-2: empty
	3-4: 1 random MU spell
	5-6: map
12 an intact potion of healing

### 3-52: Great Seat of Contemplation

* This 25’-high chamber is extremely old, created by the Rudishva early in their tenure in the middle halls, centuries before the priests of Thoth rediscovered the area.
	* The floor is composed of cracked and buckled 10’-square flagstones (+1x diff terrain, -1 atk)  The walls are undecorated grey granite.
		* Careful investigation notes the flagstones around the chair look newer.  The priests shifted the chair from looking west to the chasm to looking across at their Lesser Chair (3-53).
	* The centerpiece is a giant stone chair (4' seat, 5' wide and deep, 6' back). 
		* The back is draped loosely with an extremely worn piece of leather.
			* The back is incised with a 2' rudishva glyph for guardianship.
		* The seat and arms of the chair are worn by use, and slightly greasy to the touch. 
			* The seat is incised with a 2' rudishva glyph for sight.
		* The glyphs are activated by the touch of living flesh.  Anyone sitting in the seat activates the glyph of sight.  The glyph of guardianship is activated only if the leather drape is removed.
	* Set in the floor behind the chair is an 8’x15’ stela.
		* Inscribed is an imposing biped with small horns on its temples (a rudishva) dressed in a flowing robe, its hands resting on the hilt of a great sword.  At its feet is a sinuous reptile (Kaliyani? Heqeti?).
		* Strange runes line the image (Glyphik) “Grev-Kilj the Far-Seer, Tamer of the Winged Ones, Lord of Air and Earth, Student of Subterranean Life Forms, Slayer of the Hopping-Ones.”

Glyph of Sight: 
* Grants the viewer a viewpoint able to fly through the chasm, perceiving a VR display within their mind (Grev-Kilj and the priests of Thoth used it extensively).
	* Takes time to adapt.  50% chance the user vomits within 3 rounds.
	* Dangerously attractive to human minds.  After 1 Turn of use, save vs Spells to voluntarily leave the seat.  May try again after 6 hours.  Those ensnared feel a great compulsion to return to the seat and use it again.
* A few old rudishva regions of the chasm are cloaked from the sight of the chair, appearing as clouds of roiling darkness.: the Floating Gardens (6-4 and 7-4), area 6-99, and area 9-71. Note that the chair provides perfect vision, as if the chasm was well lit.
* Vision is clear, like 60' darkvision but well lit.  Does not reveal secret doors or hidden passageways.
* A complete scan of the chasm will take many days to accomplish.

Glyph of Guardianship: 
* Activates the rudishva point defense systems defending the rudishva bastion (9-88) for 3 hours before shutting off (probably kills the mimic there?)
* The remains of Grev-Kilj burst forth from beneath the stela and attack those who dare to use his chair.

Grev-Kilj, intelligent giant rudishva skeleton (see new monsters): SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 68; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%. Special attacks: bone throwing; sonic blast. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from sharp or edged weapons; half damage from fire; immune to sleep, charm, cold, poison, and paralysis. 

##### 3-52a: Forgotten Hall, with connections to AV-12 and 5-64

* This hall is only 7’ tall, and contains three sarcophagi.
	* Each sarcophagus bears a crude image of a rudishva carved into its lid and the words (Mithric) “Old One. Do Not Open.”
	* Each is bound with rusted metal bands, preventing it from being opened.
	* Inside each is a giant rudishva skeleton.
		* If they hear noise (any party that isn't trying to be very quiet) they become agitated.  Those outside hear sounds of scraping, clawing, and hammering from inside.
		* Each round, for each sarcophagus, there is a 1-in-10 chance the hammering breaks the rusted bands.  On a 2-4, the bends visibly bend and creak.
* The natural tunnel east climbs 350’ before ending at a crack in the wall of the cellar of the north tower at AV-12. 
* Secret Door (north): opens by pushing a catch hidden beneath the eastern-most sarcophagus. It leads to a long, 5’-wide staircase that descends 250’ to 5-64.

3 semi-intelligent giant rudishva skeletons: SZ L; AL NE; AC 2; MV 90’; HD 8+8; HP 61, 55, 52; #AT 1 or 2; Dmg 3-18 (weapon) or 2-8/2-8 (bone throwing); MR 50%. Special attacks: bone 
throwing; sonic blast. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; half damage from sharp or edged weapons; half damage from fire; immune to sleep, charm, cold, poison, and paralysis.

### 3-53: Lesser Seat of Contemplation

* A stone chair proportioned for human beings sits in the center of this chamber, facing out across the chasm towards 3-52.  Its seat bears the Rudishva glyph of sight.
	* It lies on the exact axis of the Great Seat of Contemplation in 3-52 and was built by the priests of Thoth to mimic the effects of the Great Seat without some of the risks. 
	* Touching the glyph grants projected sight, but it is erratic and hazardous (roll d10).
		* 1-4 Immobile vision of a single area (d6) of the chasm lasting 1 turn.
			* 1: Hall of Whispers (2-63)
			* 2: Seat of Contemplation (3-52)
			* 3: Thoth, Knower of Secrets (3-40)
			* 4: Sundered Span (5-35)
			* 5: The Sanctum (5-83)
			* 6: The Troll Lift (6-5)
		* 5 Blindness (permanent)
		* 6 See invisible and hidden, 1 day
		* 7 A horrible vision of a demon; it haunts the PC until curse is removed. 
		* 8-9 see stars for 1-6 days, causing all rolls involving sight to be at -1
		* 10 Hint of a tantalizing vision of a location in the Halls (GM’s choice) that fades to black after a second

### 3-54: Porch

* The narrow passageway from 3-55 leads to a shallow, undecorated porch looking out over the chasm.
	* A pair of iron sconces are attached to the southwestern wall.
	* Listeners will hear moving air and a random chasm sound (see 3-38).
	* Three 50' coils of hemp rope, a hammer, and 20 iron spikes lie on the floor.
		* The rope is quite old (3 in 6) to break when 75 lb supported for >= 4 rounds.
* Light and sound on the porch likely (75%) draws the spiders from 3-55 (arriving in 4 rounds), and an encounter with the spiders may (25%) provoke 2 rolls on the chasm random encounter table (see 3-38).

### 3-55: Stairs Down to 5-76

* This staircase leads down 250’ at a steep angle to 5-76.
	* The stairs are granite blocks, littered with dust and stone chips.
	* About 50’ down the stair is a thick web in which live 4 huge spiders.
		* The stairs under the web are littered with bones, mostly of beastmen. 
		* Among the corpses are 93 sp, 210 cp, and a fine broadsword worth 30 gp.

4 huge spiders: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 180’; HD 2+2; HP 15, 13, 13, 11; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: surprise 1-5; poison (+1 to saves); can leap up to 30’.

### 3-56: Secret Doors and Pit Trap

* The passageway is rough undecorated stone, only 6’ tall, and extremely dusty. 
	* Secret Door (west, from 3-65 and 3-53): the catch can be released by sliding a thin object along a 1/8-inch wide opening between the secret door and the floor, releasing it to pivot on a vertical pin.
	* Secret Door, trapped (east): easy to detect (1 in 4), opens by pushing.  If a hidden catch is not enaged, when the door opens, the pit does too.
		* Trap (pit trap): -5% to detect, 30’-deep pit. Lid closes after 1 Turn.
			* Bones of dead adventurers, 2 long swords, 1 mace, 3 short swords, 6 spears (one is a spear +1). A dozen suits of unusable metal and leather,  three usable shields (one is a shield +2). Scattered in various rotting purses and backpacks are 257 gp, 143 sp, 87 cp, two vials of holy water, and a potion of waterbreathing.

### 3-57: Antechamber

* The door from 3-64 is a typical wooden door, but stuck.
* The stone walls are painted a peeling yellow, with 3' high stone benches attached to all the walls.
	* The benches are hinged (not obvious unless examined, detect as secret door), covering storage spaces.  All are empty except the one next to the door.
		* Inside is a bolt of carefully folded yellow silk (100 gp), a bulls-eye lantern, a flask of oil, and an octavo-sized codex marked “Property of Eustachius the Cantor” (books).

##### 3-57a: Trapped Door

* The door is a normal, well-oiled, wooden door that opens out, to the north.
	* The beastman witch doctors cast Probus’s Thunderous Alert (new) across this opening.
		* Anyone crossing the entryway must save vs Spells or a dozen very loud brass horns sound for 10 minutes, alerting the beastmen at 3-160. 

### 3-58: Chapter House

* The Collegiate Chapter of the clergy of Thoth met here to discuss internal business under the leadership of the prior.
* The Chapter House is richly painted, with a sky blue ceiling on which was depicted the constellation of the ibis in gold stars.
* Thirty-nine cherry-wood stalls line the walls; each 5’ tall and 4’ wide, with a 3’-deep seat.
	* The stalls are intricately carved with floral, geometric, and animal patterns.
* On the east wall is a larger seat, 8’ tall, 6’ wide, and 5’ deep, with a wooden canopy; this is the prior’s seat.
	* Secret Door (east): hidden in the back of the prior’s seat, opened by pressing the eye of a carved ibis on the prior’s seat.  A panel on the back of the prior’s seat springs forward, revealing the passageway beyond.
* All of the seats, including the prior, are hinged, covering a storage cavity.
	* Six stalls contain items (2 Turns to search them all).
		* 1: a potion of hill giant strength
		* 2: a leather pouch with 250 ancient silver pennies
		* 3: a potion of poison
		* 4: a quarto volume of erotica entitled The Seventy-Four Ways of Opening the Lotus (books)
		* 5: an orange cylindrical ceremonial headdress made of silk and studded with colored glass (175 gp)
		* 6: a pair (yellow and green) of glass activation squares.
* The center of the chamber contains an oval band of unusual living mosaic 15’ tall by 8’ wide (new).
	* The mosaic's image can be controlled by standing in 3’-square, 6”-deep indentation in the middle of the oval and thinking of the appropriate location (must be known in order to visualize).
	* Currently showing 3-2.
* 25% chance the ghost of Prior Jacobus the Small is present (see 3-59).
	* Because of this, the beastmen avoid this chamber.

### 3-59: Prior’s Study

* This chamber housed the private quarters and study of the prior of Thoth, the second highest ranking officer in the temple (after the high priest).
* The study is decorated with 52 impressive frescoes of previous priors, all dressed in ceremonial robes and cylindrical hats, with empty spaces for 2 more future priors.
	* The last image is an extremely short (4’ 10”), heavy-featured, older man with silver hair and eyes (Jacobus the Small, last prior before the collapse of the temple).
* Furnishing include: 
	* A marble pedestal with a copper bowl (now filled with dust)
	* A cherry-wood desk with one drawer, and a stool.
		* Resting on the desk is a silver letter-opener (15 gp), a bronze ink well (10 sp), a fancy stylus (5 sp), and a gold and opal signet ring (100 gp).
		* On the desk is a sheaf of parchments, mostly mundane financial and personnel matters.
			* One sheet is the plans for the complex at 3-61 to 3-63, marked “Tomb of Jacobus, 52nd Claustral Prior of the Chapter of Thoth”.  They clearly indicate the secret door and the location of the sarcophagus in 3-63.
	* A small cabinet for scrolls.
		* Contains 50 scrolls bound with silk ribbons of mundane administrative and financial records.
			* Rolled up inside one scroll is a sketch map of some areas of Level 3, including areas 3-71, 3-77 to 3-80, and 3-86.
		* A single quire containing one of The Deeds of Phagtro the Westron (books).
	* A small armoire and a camp bed made of carved ebony.

			* In one hat is a small key strung with orange silk as a necklace (to the secret door in 3-60).
* The benign ghost of Prior Jacobus haunts the study.
	* If not encountered in 3-58 (25% chance), he will be here, sitting at his desk.
	* Jacobus greets any arrival with delight and relief, rising and gesticulating wildly at himself, his desk, and his surroundings.
		* He cannot audibly communicate with the living.
			* He will try to point to the blueprints on the desk, indicating the tomb.
		* He can move between areas 3-58, 3-59 and 3-60, but nowhere else.
		* Immune to physical attacks, but might be harmed by magic.
		* If angered, he can strangle as does a haunt.
		* His body was never placed in the grand tomb he was preparing (3-61 to 3-63).
		* He will haunt these rooms until his remains (3-61) are placed in the sarcophagus in 3-63.
			* In that event, his ghost appears, bows gratefully, indicates the secret compartment in the sarcophagus, and disappears for good. 

### 3-60: Supply Closet

* This former supply closet has been enthusiastically and systematically plundered, leaving just scraps of parchment and bits of linen and silk.
	* Secret Door (north): difficult to find seam and keyhole (d8) from within the room, obvious from the tunnel.  
	* 5'-tall x 3'-wide, locked (key in 3-59), swings inward toward 3-61. 

## Level 3: 61 - 75

### 3-61: Tombs of the Priors

* This chamber contains the tombs and gisants of all 51 of the priors of the chapter of priests of Thoth.
	* The imposing stone double-doors to the chasm swing open; their locks smashed, preventing them from being secured. 
	* 32 early priors were buried neatly in niches carved into the walls, each 3’ deep with a carved marble gisant of the prior (varying gender, race, size, etc).
		* Only the last 10 of the gisants conceal cavities for bones and grave goods.
			* 1d3+1 Turns of hard work with tools (noisy, attracting encounters, see 3-38) to remove the lid of each gisant.
			* Nine contain only bones and minor jewelry (1d10 x 10 gp). The tenth (the 33rd prior, Yakon), contains a wand of lightning (5 charges).
	* The other 19 priors were entombed in sarcophagi of varying composition and quality set haphazardly on the floor of the chamber.
		* They obscure and, in places, have damaged, some beautiful floor mosaics featuring pastoral scenes.
		* Some are stone, some marble, a few are oak caskets.  There is a gradual simplification in artistic style of the images carved on the tomb lids.
		* All have been opened, their lids lie in and between the sarcophagi, making the room a jumble of concealed spaces and narrow pathways through the clutter.
			* Difficult terrain, -1 atk.
			* Every 2 Turns of searching: 25% of finding coins worth 15 gp (50%) or a gem (50 gp) (50%) (maximum of 350 gp worth).
	* A pack of ghouls led by a wight (the 51st prior) has taken up residence in the hall.
		* They wait several rounds before springing their ambush (25% chance one moans with hungry anticipation, spoiling the surprise).
	* The funeral-shrouded skeleton (short of stature) of Prior Jacobus, the 52nd prior, lies on the floor in front of the secret door to 3-63.
		* The wight attacked Jacobus’s servants as they brought him to his resting place, and they dropped him unceremoniously here.
		* On Jacobus’s corpse: a gold and sapphire torc (950 gp), small iron rod to open the southeast secret door, a small duplicate key to the secret door in 3-60 on an orange silken cord.
	* Secret Door (southeast): narrow and short, leads to a short hallway to 3-60; difficult to spot (1-in-8), opens by sliding a rod into a 1/4”-diameter hole next to the door.
	* Secret Door (northeast): hidden in the back of a burial niche; a rectangle 24” high x 4’ long, opened by sliding the panel upward, revealing the passage to 3-63.

1 wight: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 120’; HD 4+3; HP 28; #AT 1; Dmg 1-4. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic needed to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis.

* The tomb features a large marble pedestal with a life-sized marble gisant of Kyrus.
	* Gisant and wall-art are defaced by the wight, who has made this tomb his nest.  The whole area stinks of decay and death.

### 3-63: Priors’ Hoard

* The secret panel in the burial niche at 3-61 leads to a short passageway, and from there to a small room crammed with treasures.
	* A marble lid sits beside an empty sarcophagus.
		* Incised with the image of a very short man in Thothian ceremonial robes, with the legend (Mithric), “Iacobus, Prior of Thoth”.
		* If the remains of Jacobus are brought from 3-61, placed in the sarcophagus, and the lid put into place, the ghost of Jacobus (3-59) appears, points to a secret panel on the sarcophagus, and fades into happy oblivion.
		* Secret compartment: 1-in-10 to spot, locked it is locked, contains: ring of free action, belt of hill giant strength.
	* The rest of the chamber is strewn with treasures accumulated by centuries of priors.

### 3-65: Hall of Remembering

* The chamber has the usual thick dust and trash.
	* The walls are not badly damaged and show a midnight blue with hundreds of small flecks of silver - one per priest of Thoth.
	* On a low dais is a 4’-tall alabaster book stand, on which are some scraps of parchment.
		* Originally it held the Memorial Codex of Thoth (books), with names and dates of death in the priesthood.  It was taken by the beastmen, and is currently in Deino’s chamber (3-158).
	* Two stone doors and a secret door exit from this chamber.
		* The stone doors only open with difficulty (as if stuck).
		* Secret Doors (east): opens only to a Knock spell.

##### 3-65a: False Door and Traps

* The ibis-covered wall frescoes of this corridor have been vigorously defaced.
	* Lying along it are some 20 corpses, surrounded by bits of broken adventuring gear.
		* Searching the corpses for 1d3 Turns: longsword +1, a scroll (protection from normal missiles, massmorph, hold monster, reincarnation, clenched fist, volley), gold ring (50 gp), ioun stone (incandescent blue), shield +2; 177 cp, 143 sp, 568 gp, and 97 pp.
	* The door at the north end of the corridor is a false door.
		* Upon opening the false door, the entry door swings shut and has no way to be opened from within the hall.
		* Trapped victims eventually die of thirst or hunger.  Only magic, actual stone mining tools, or someone else opening the outer door can save those trapped within.
			* A patrol of beastmen might investigate and parley surrender or ransom for rescue.

##### 3-65b: Another False Door and Trap

* The plastered walls of this corridor are painted sky-blue with numerous white ibises.
* The door at the north end is a trapped false door.
	* Opening the false door opens four pit traps (20' deep) along the corridor.  The pits’ lids snap closed after 2 rounds.
		* The pit closest to the false door contains a recent corpse (human thief).
			* Leather armor, a short sword, and a 5-lb gold ingot stamped with the imperial insignia (250 gp).

* This complex houses the tomb of Ptoh-Ristus, cleric of Thoth and one of the companions of Arden and Vul.

The Antechamber
* The 20’-tall antechamber, or eastern ell, is supported by six thick basalt columns.
* Thirty-two 5’x5’ slate flagstones cover its floor, with thin gaps between.
	* (Entry pressure plate) the 10 x 10 area of flagstones north of the secret door leading to 3-65 drop a massive (10 x 10 x10) granite block onto their space.
		* Save vs Doom at -2 or be instantly crushed.  The fallen stone blocks departure.
	* (Wall pressure plates) the eight northernmost and eight southernmost flagstones launch 1d3 darts from the priest eye-holes nearest the triggering space (atk 19 each).
		* Each dart deals 1d3 damage; 1-in-4 darts has still-potent poison (2d6 damage, save for half).
		* A thin blade can slide between flagstones and cut a trigger wire there.
* The walls are painted with images of Thothian priests in orange ceremonial robes and tall cylindrical orange hats, all striding towards the western part of the chamber.
	* The eyes of these priests are black and round; actually holes, rather than painted eyes, if scrutinized.
* Secret Door (antechamber, leading to 3-65): opens by sliding a panel to the right.

The Tomb of Ptoh-Ristus
* West of the antechamber is the tomb proper, with a 40’ ceiling, a floor of large, fitted, marble flagstones (5’ square), and walls painted a pleasing shade of blue.
	* In the center is a 15’x20’ dais supporting Ptoh-Ristus’s enormous, polished basalt sarcophagus (10’x15’).

	* To the left is a cloaked figure (Vul), pointing three fingers at Ptoh-Ristus.
* On the east wall, flanking the entry to the antechamber (perhaps initially hidden when entering via the antechamber), are 8’-tall stone statues of kilt-clad spearmen.
	* These Archontean animated constructs attack any who enter from the antechamber.
* Secret Door (north): the white sacrophagus must be moved to access the button on the wall that opens the door.

	* A rotting grimalkin head is impaled on a spear, stuck in a crack in the pavement just before the northern door, marked X.

### 3-70: Traps and Beastmen

* Originally a minor administrative office complex for the cult of Thoth. It has been occupied as a forward outpost by some beastmen from Sheep Company (see 3-141).
	* Nervous about their exposed position, they have devised several traps.
	* Parties bypassing 3-70 heading south will be spotted from the peephole in 3-70A.
	* If discovered, the beastmen will negotiate with non-aggressive parties. 
* Door (trapped): opening the door to 3-70 triggers a pair of crossbow traps (d8 damage each).  A tripwire 1' high catches anyone rushing through the doorway (DEX vs 5 or fall prone, d6 damage if running).

##### 3-70a: Beastman Outpost

* Inside are some bedrolls, a small brazier, and several sacks of provisions.
	* The beastmen use the peephole here to spy on those passing by. They shadow any party that passes southward, hoping to engage it from the rear.

##### 3-70c: Bait and Switch

	* To one side of the trash pile sits a wooden chest, bait for the hasty.
		* It is locked, but contains only sand.
	* The beastmen in 3-70a and 3-70b hope to lure the incautious into this chamber and lock them in.
		* Should a party enter the chamber, they rush out and slam the door, then hammer two wooden beams across the door and spike the door jamb.

### 3-71: Desecrated Temple of Thoth

* The narrow (5’-wide), undecorated passage from 3-15 opens suddenly into an enormous darkened hall whose walls rise out of the gloom 30’ to a coffer-vaulted ceiling.
	* The cult statue of Thoth commands immediate attention on its pedestal lying in the center of a low pool.
	* Rows of columns lead from the entrance towards that impressive statue, but just over half have been thrown down, leaving the floor covered in dust and stone fragments.
	* Empty iron sconces line the walls at 15’ intervals.
	* Clear tracks through the debris lead towards the door in the southwest corner of the room. 
* Desecration by Set (evil beings gain +1 to all d20 rolls, good ones take -1)
	* The walls are smeared with dirt and feces, and all the gilt has been pulled off.
	* Obscene images and vulgar phrases are scrawled across the walls of the temple.
		* (Archontean): “The Ibis has been Shorn”, “Fuck Thoth!”, “We have ‘known’ Thoth, but there is better flesh to be known in Archontos” and “Where is your power now, Bird-Brain?,” and so forth.
	* An enormous sketch of a crocodile devouring an ibis has been splashed with black paint on the western wall behind Thoth’s statue.
	* Several rotting corpses of goblins, humans, and beastmen have been piled in front of the statue and pool.
	* A fresher pair of human corpses have been stripped of all clothing and pinned to the north wall with iron nails. 
	* Those sensitive to such things feel the aching ‘wrongness’ of the desecration as a damp shroud falling over all who enter. 
* Statue of Thoth: Thoth stands 20' tall, carved of black marble with a white marble ibis head, in the classic semi-advancing pose, arms at his side. He wears a kilt and a headdress with a single feather in it. 
	* Unable to knock over the statue, the Set cultists defaced it.  Bits of dung and streaks of dried blood spatter it; the head of a beastman is impaled on the feather.
	* The eye sockets are gaping holes (the Set cultists pried out the sapphire eyes, which are currently in the Set temple, at 3-90). 
		* If restored, the desecration ends in a blast of white light, cleaning all wounds and granting enough XP to each hero to raise them to their current position in the next level.
* Pool of Faith: The statue is centered in a basin that is 3’ tall and 15’ in diameter.
	* Originally filled with cool clear water, it has been desecrated and now holds a malodorous opaque sludge, within which lurks a slime kraken.
		* If the kraken is defeated, the pool can be purified with a vial of holy water.  It loses its odor and color, and will return to crystal-clear within a week.
		* Drinking from it cures 1d6 HP per draught per day (water can't be removed and retain its effect).  The water level is constant, regardless of consumption.
	* A yellow glass activation square and a Thothian passkey rest in the Pool of Faith.
* The Set cult carved two spy holes 20' up the western wall (3-90b) looking over the empty fane of Thoth.
	* 33% chance Set’s spies notice movement in the temple of Thoth, or 66% if a group engages the slime kraken in extended combat.
	* Even if noticed, they likely just watch, but alert the minions of Set in 3-81 and 3-89 to be ready to repel intruders.
* Secret Doors
	* North and South walls: easy to spot (1 in 4), opened by a catch beside them.
	* Southwest corner: opens by pulling a nearby iron wall sconce.
		* Traffic through the door is regular, but most explorers assume that the tracks lead to the door to 3-77 instead of to the secret door.

1 slime kraken (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC 4 (-3 submerged in basin); MV 120’ swimming; HD 7, HP 49; #AT 7 (6 pseudopods and a beak); Dmg 1-8(x6)/1-12. Special attacks: stunning slime (poison at +2 or stunned +1d3 rounds). Special defenses: slow regeneration (1d6 / Turn).

### 3-72: Alcoves of the Guardians

* These semi-circular chambers hold only the grime, filth and graffiti found in 3-71.
	* Each alcove originally housed a guardian of Thoth.
	* If the temple is cleansed of its desecration, the magic binding the guardians is restored.
	* Should that occur, they will manifest and emerge to challenge those who approach the statue of Thoth without bearing his holy symbols (attacking if they do not desist).

### 3-74: South Gallery

* A narrow gallery, 15' above the temple floor, accessed by a door and a ramp, overlooks the grand temple of Thoth.
	* The ramp is decorated with reliefs of servants of Thoth carrying various treasures, codices, and scrolls. These scenes are faded and worn, but not overtly desecrated.

	* A secondary cave extends to the southwest; the geode sphere only 10’ in diameter.

* This cave is a natural pocket of arcanum (new), with the usual compulsions and properties of such. 
	* Casters and inherently magical creatures save vs Spells or feel compelled to linger in the cave for 1d4+1 days, studying and basking in the arcanum's power.  After which they conquer the compulsion and may leave.
		* Each day of extended exposure, roll a random effect.

		* If the soul stone (new) is removed, he whispers raggedly (Mithric) “Go no further. They are waiting," after which his soul departs.
			* He warns of the zhouls in 3-80 and the wight in 3-86.

### 3-80: Those Who Wait

* The door to this room is stuck.
* Long strips of pale blue paint flake from the walls, and a half-dozen coffers line the walls.

	* Tracks from the secret door lead to the center of the room and stop. 
* The junk pile to the southwest is a heap of furniture (settee frames, bits of bookcases, side table tops, and numerous table legs), concealing an ordinary door (to 3-89).

		* Her party came through the pyramid, then through the secret door in 3-15.  They fought the slime kraken and a party of Set cultists attacked them.  They fled into the 82-85 rooms, where her companions were killed by 2 ghouls, but she finished off the last.  She fears to leave back into the temple, but knows the one-way door goes into the undead-filled catacombs, blocked by a portcullis (they went that way once before, and retreated and reclosed the gate).

* The chamber is sheathed in white marble squares (5’ square) on all walls, floor and ceiling.
	* Each square of marble has a symbol incised in its center and filled with gold inlay.
		* Symbol: an open, toothless mouth, from which extends a thick tongue.
		* All the tiles are slick with dripping moisture; the moisture beads on each incised tongue, dripping off or down, eventually collecting in the basin.
	* The floor is slightly convex, dipping towards a 10’-diameter basin in the middle of the floor.
		* The chamber is quite slippery (+1x difficult terrain, 3d6 under Dex or fall is moving quickly.
		* Anyone slipping may slide down to the basin, affected by multiple doses of sweat of Rimmaq-Isfet (new) for 5-20 damage.

	* The stairwell is narrow (5’ wide), roughly carved, and unadorned.
	* It ends at a small landing (10’x10’x10’), with light visible through a 4’x4’ hole in the ceiling.
	* The hole leads to the legendary Oracle of Thoth.

* The Oracle chamber lies beneath a shallow dome 25’ high in its center; brightly lit by a continual light spell.
	* The walls curve inward immediately, making the ceiling quite low along the edge.
	* The ceiling is painted with a bright yellow paint that glitters and sparkles in the light.

* A 10’x10’ dais lies in the center of the chamber.
	* Once shrouded by hanging curtains.  They have long since rotted, leaving sagging iron curtain rods in a square around it.
	* On the dais is a large and unusual statue of an ibis, wings cocked to enclose a marble seat just in front of the ibis’s body.
		* The seat is arranged such that any sitting in it are enfolded by the ibis’s wings, their head shadowed by the ibis’s beak.
		* The ibis statue is impressive: marble, lapis, and jet cleverly worked together to produce an effect of verisimilitude.
			* The head is pure white marble, carved to resemble a real bird - save with empty and vacant holes for eyes.
			* Though the statue is clearly stone, the marble may be seen to gently rise and fall, as if the bird were actually breathing.
		* The plinth on which the statue sits is inscribed (Thothian tongue): “Sit, Ask, and Receive. Lord Thoth Knows All.”
		* Currently a human figure is writhing in the chair, surrounded by the wings of the ibis.
			* This is Anaximander, an Archontean sage. 

Anaximander
* Arriving here 250 years ago with Adrienic’s expedition (see 5-18), Anaximander sought to trick the Oracle into providing more than its customary delphic pronouncements. He has been condemned ever since to trade riddles with an Aspect of Thoth, while his life was preserved (barely) by the magical breath of Thoth.
* Anaximander’s body is wasted and thin, and his beard and hair are now long, stringy and white. He mutters nonsense words under his breath as he thrashes about.
* Only if he is physically pulled from the Oracle will he leave its embrace.  He then faces life as an extremely old, frail, and insane person, whose ravings may well be taken as oracular themselves. He will not be able to convey much of interest to adventurers, and if pressed will merely babble in Archontean “My hubris was my downfall. Hubris! Pride! Alas. The voice .... I could not withstand His voice ....” He speaks thereafter in crude doggerel and only responds to questions with riddles or with what may actually be the answers to unknown riddles.

Consulting the Oracle
* Once Anaximander is gone, anyone may consult the Oracle by sitting in the chair.  A postulant is immediately enveloped by a warm secure layer of air, and *feels* a low voice state “Speak Thy Query” in his/her mind.
	* Speaking or thinking a question results in several seconds of psychic turmoil culminating in the postulant losing conscious control of his or her brain.
	* Bystanders hear a deep, alien voice boom forth from the lips of the postulant as the oracle is declaimed. The postulant must succeed at a roll of 4d6 under INT to recall what Thoth said through him or her.
* What is said by the Oracle is delphic, that is, obscure and in need of interpretation; in no way does it provide a straight factual answer.
	* The Oracle can and will predict future events as well as specific, current questions of fact; the degree of opacity of its answer is inversely related to both the specificity of a question or the temporal distance of a prediction.  More specific factual questions and more distant predictions will elicit more opaque responses.
		* For instance, if a postulant asks/thinks, “Will I die in the Halls of Arden Vul”, the Oracle might reply in fairly specific ways, such as “Thy fate is linked to the month of the Crab and the acquisition of the iron circlet of Ghanor; Thou shall not fear under such signs” [a very specific response].
		* If a postulant were to ask, “Where is the iron circlet of Ghanor?”, the response might be “Resisting the Breath of the Feeble will lay bare the Path” [a reference to 3-127A].
		* And if a postulant were to ask, “Will I become a king?” the response would be true, but vague, along the lines of “Thou shall reign over time and mortals in the capacity that Thou desires.”

Effects of an Oracular Pronouncement:
* In addition to the Oracle’s pronouncement, Thoth’s voice stuns listeners for 1-4 rounds (save vs petrification to resist) and reduces the WIS of the postulant by 2-6 for 1-4 days due to the psychic shock of acting as the conduit for Thoth’s dicta.
	* If the postulant is a priest of Thoth, the wisdom loss is halved (1-3).
	* If the postulant is evil, a greater guardian of Thoth (see new monsters) teleports in to dispatch the blasphemer (in addition to the standard WIS loss).
	* There is a base 10% chance that any postulant immediately becomes a devotee of Thoth; this chance increases by 2% for each subsequent consultation. Such converts will be fanatical, and conversion may have class and/or alignment implications.
* Due to the psychic stress of channeling Thoth, characters may only consult the Oracle once per month.

### 3-119: Fountain of Knowledge

* A domed chamber, damp and mildewed, with long strands of rotting plaster hanging from the ceiling/walls.
	* In the center is a 10’-wide basin with a fountain gushing prodigious amounts clear, cold water.
		* The water is mundane, but temporarily transformed by the basin into a elixir.
		* Originally meant to boost Wis (to counter the effects of the Oracle), but now turned chaotic.  Only works once per month per person.
	* The water has spilled over the basin and collected in a low pool in the southeast corner of the room.
	* Over centuries the water has eroded a segment of wall, producing a small stream that disappears into a wall of fractured rock.

### 3-123: Great Hall

* The Great Hall is an imposing place, with a ceiling that stretches some 100’ above the floor.

	* The Hall is dark, although brackets for a score of torches still exist on the walls. 
	* The first 25’ of wall was originally plastered and decorated with images of Thoth.
		* Still remaining is a monumental side view of Thoth, left arm horizontal to the ground and pointing, right arm against his thigh (a clue to the puzzle in 3-2).
	* Eight 40’-tall freestanding columns once lined the Hall, now thrown down, with only 5’-tall broken stumps remaining.
	* There is remarkably little dust here, a sign that much traffic flows through this hall.
	* Scorch marks are easily noticeable on the floor and walls, and a large number of broken arrows litter the ground.
	* The upper reaches of the hall extend into Sub-Level 3 (see SL3-3).
		* With enough light, 75' above are seen an arcade circumscribing the hall, a stone bridge passing west to east, and at the south end, the looming statue of Thoth, the Overseer of Truth (see SL3-3).
	* Just south of the entry from 3-121 is a painting of a bearded man with empty eyes.

			* #3: a pearl (195 gp), a green glass activation square
			* #4 a silver pitcher (25 gp), 2 aquamarines (100 gp).
	* Secret Door (west, leading to 3-121): easy to spot (1 in 4), opens by pushing a stone panel inward.

* If beastmen have sounded the horns in 3-121, the hall resounds to large kettledrums beating a military rhythm (see 3-123A).

Teleport Destination
* The Great Hall is arrival point for several one-way teleporters: UP-11, 2-10 and 4-167.

* Each barricade is manned by a bandon of 6 beastman troopers and a sergeant. 
	* They don't immediately engage those entering the Great Hall.
	* If warned by the horns at 3-121, they beat their kettle drums in a slow, rhythmic tempo.
	* If confronted by clearly superior forces, or rapid 33% casualties, the sergeant sends a runner for additional forces from the relevant barracks (3-138, 3-140, or 3-141), as well as from their varumani allies in 3-162 (25% chance the varumani ignore the summons).

### 3-127: Hidden Tombs

* * The narrow, low tunnel from 3-122 is littered with five charred, rotted bodies.
	* No usable equipment, except an ebony ring of protection +1 (hard to spot).
	* The tunnel ends in a plain wooden door, swollen with moisture and stuck.
* This is the tomb of Neferet, one of the last high priestesses of Thoth.
	* It is also the location of the legendary Iron Circlet of Ghanor (new). 
 * The main area is a 10’-tall chamber with frescos of pleasant pastoral scenes of men and women fishing, hawking, and hunting.
	 * The west wall (to 3-127A) is illusory, and appears comparable to the rest.
	 * Wide archways lead north and south to separate chambers (3-127B and 3-127C).
	 * The false tomb of Neferet dominates the center of the main chamber.
		 * On a 2’ dais rests a large basalt sarcophagus (6’ long, 3’ high, 2’-4’ wide).
		 * The long sides are carved (Mithric) “Neferet, Beloved of Thoth, Seeker of Truth, Preserver of Secrets”. 
		 * The lid's image is of a placid-looking female in classic pose, wearing a circlet.
			 * Requires a feat of strength (like a stuck door) to remove the lid.
			 * Opening it wakes the undead in the adjoining rooms.  They attack, with Neferet herself (in 3-127A) casting spells through the illusory wall.
		 * The false tomb contains only sand, with a layer of dust of sneezing and choking covering it.
			 * Disturbing the sand unleashes the dust.  3 doses if skimmed very carefully.

##### 3-127a: Illusory Wall and True Tomb

* Behind the illusory wall from 3-127 lies the true tomb of Neferet. 
	* It is only 8’ tall, and is painted a darker blue on which appear a variety of mystical symbols (moons, stars, hermetic symbols, knots, etc.).
	* In the center of the room is a simple granite sarcophagus.
		* If intruders have opened the sarcophagus in 3-127, Neferet rises as a greater mummy to smite the desecrators, still dressed in the tattered orange ceremonial robes of the priesthood of Thoth, with a prominent ankh and ibis on a chain around her neck. She wears the Iron Circlet of Ghanor (new).  The smell of spice emanates strongly from her body.
	* The rest of the chamber is crowded with grave goods.
		* Delicate gilt chairs, a gilt settee, several ankhs on the end of 10’ poles (5000 gp intact, but fragile, 250 gp for just the gilt).
		* A 10’-diameter net made of gold mesh (Immobilizing Mesh, new)
		* A variety of alabaster and jet canopic jars (250 gp total).
			* There is a diamond (2500 gp) in one canopic jar, in another a pearl of the sirines, and 4 beads of force in another.
		* 5 cleric scrolls (dispel magic, bestow curse, neutralize poison, detect magic, speak with dead)
	* A few bits of crumpled parchment have been tossed into the corners.
		* One reads (Mithric) “To Neferet, glorious Priestess, from Hellas, humble librarian, greetings. I am working to accommodate your request to transport the contents of the special library to your new residence. Alas, the flight of so many of our acolytes, the evils of the present age, and my own decrepitude has delayed their transfer. I will seek to fulfill your wishes in good order.”
			* GM Note: this is the final draft of the note found in 2-71; Hellas never intended to move the library.

Tactics
* Once awakened, Neferet allows her minions from 3-127B and 3-127C to confront the desecrators while she fires spells through the illusory wall. The source of these spells may be unclear.  The strong smell of her spice may be a clue to her presence.
Sample tactics
* Neferet opens combat by casting silence 15’ radius into 3-127, then protection from good and hold person. Given conditions in 3-127, she might then cast insect plague or blindness. She uses cause and cure wounds spells as needed. She waits until the illusory wall is discovered to cast darkness, and until her minions are defeated to use flame strike. Only then, and possibly only after casting resist fire on herself, will she emerge to engage in hand-to-hand combat.

	* She is unable to use the iron circlet of Ghanor (a side effect of mummification)

## Level 3: 138 - 162 (Precincts of the Beastmen)

* In ancient times this was the heart of administrative and priestly activity for the cult of Thoth. It is now the home of a group of humanoids known known in the halls as ‘beastmen’, who call themselves either the Children of Deino or, more formally, the 4th Kentarchia of the 3rd Cohort of the Imperial Tagmata.
* All beastmen appear as hybrids of human and beast, whether the beast be dog, pig, goat, sheep, or rat. They are the product of centuries of breeding experiments overseen by Deino, a quasi-immortal sorceress (see 3-158). 

Background
* Some 250 years ago, the emperor sent a new archon, Adrienic (see 5-18), to Arden Vul with orders to re-establish imperial control over the complex. Adrienic brought with him the elite 3rd Cohort of the Imperial Tagma and the 2nd legion of scutarii (heavy infantry).
* When the imperial expedition foundered in the lower levels, the men of the 3rd Cohort sought to escape the Halls. One kentarchia (unit of 100) under the leadership of Gennadius found its way to this region, where they fell under the sway of Deino. Deino entranced most of the soldiers, although Gennadius and his faithful whippet (named Rex) managed to escape (see 6-50 for Rex, and 8-41 for Gennadius). She kept the most handsome and useful soldiers alive through sorcery and potions, and transformed the others into beasts. She ‘grew’ her flock by interbreeding the soldiers and their descendants with animals until the current self-sustaining mix of debased beast-men was reached. 
* Despite their bestial form (and aggressive natures), the Children of Deino are surprisingly well organized and disciplined. This is due to the old legionary training of the forefathers of the group, whose expertise and tactical sense has been passed down over the generations.
* The beastmen maintain a semblance of the old military structure of their forebears, although some titles have been garbled: the Children consider themselves a single tagma divided into konturbia (‘companies’ of 20-30 members), which are subdivided into banda (patrols of 10 each).
* They are also well led, starting with Deino the witch, but also including Count Skleros (3-151) and his tough staff sergeants. Beastman military hierarchy is based on merit, even though individual Konturbia are named after a single sub-species of beastman. That means that each konturbs is actually comprised of a mixture of basic types. 
* The Children are highly organized, and react in a disciplined manner to any threat or assault. They have erected impressive barriers (3-123A) at the most obvious entry points to their domain, and post vigilant guards at each of these locations. Should intruders assault one of the entry points, the leaders will be swiftly informed, and appropriate measures will be taken to repel invaders. If possible, the beastmen attempt flanking maneuvers in force; that is, reinforcements in the form of at least one company will be sent to meet the intruders as they advance, while another company will be sent to come upon the intruder’s flank.
	* Skleros (3-151) will certainly summon the witch doctors (3-144), the varumani (3-162) if necessary (although they only respond 75% of the time), and, after some hesitation, Deino herself (3-158).
	* If intruders seem too strong, Skleros orders a fighting retreat down one of the entrance paths so as to allow the rest of the Tagma to escape out one of the other entrances/exits.
* Once assaulted, the Children will double their vigilance: no banda (patrols) will be absent from their barracks, and entrance points will be strengthened with the presence of a witch doctor and another patrol; given sufficient time, the beastmen will also rig magical and mechanical traps in the great hall (3-123). 

### 3-138: Beastman Barracks: Porcine Konturbs (Pig Company)

* The beastman troopers of Pig Company live in this chamber.
	* Pig Company ranks second in seniority, and its members are proud and haughty.
	* The konturbs is 21 beastmen, organized into three banda (patrols) of 6 troopers and one sergeant per bandon.
		* One bandon is all pig-men, the other two are mixed. The sergeants are all pig-men.
		* One bandon is always on guard at 3-123A; one bandon is always here; and the third patrol is either here (33%), or elsewhere in the complex (3-161, 3-147, 3-156, or 3-158).
*  Their chamber is spartan and very neat, with well-ordered bed-mounds surrounding a trestle table at which troopers can play dice, etc.
	* The far wall boasts the tattered Pig Company banner: a mailed fist with small fragments of equipment, bone, and a few slips of parchment (battle mementos) hanging from it.
		* Theft of the banner provokes immediate and vengeful retribution.
	* Below the banner is a 10’x10’ ‘rooting ground’ of mud and soil, ripe for wrestling and rooting.
	* * The company has a communal stone chest next to the wall.
		* Dried rations, 2 potions of healing, a few extra helmets, etc.
	* A stone water barrel sits next to the chest. 
	* A weapons rack on the other side of the door holds spears, shields, and swords.
* An arrow slit allows support of allies at 3-123a.
	* Two troopers are always posted near the slit with bows at the ready.
* The company has collected a dozen busts and bits of statuary to decorate its barracks.
	* One is a portrait bust of Priscus Pulcher (so marked on its base) and malfunctioning Sortian face.
		* A handsome young man, with close-cropped hair, a trim beard, and smiling eyes.  Empty sockets in the place of eyes.
			* Sortian eyes placed in the sockets cause fizzing and sputtering.
* Pig Company’s prize possession is the mummified head of Comentiolus, one of the original imperial soldiers and, according to Pig Company lore, the ‘First Pig’.
	* Comentiolus’s head is often touched for luck, and is thus fairly shiny with wear.
	* Given the right spell, PCs might learn something from Comentiolus’s restless shade.

	* Brooms, hammers and chisels, a wide selection of pieces of lumber pillaged from the halls, and odds and ends (goblin equipment and weapons, coils of rope, etc.).
	* 20% chance any bit of non-comestible, non-warlike equipment can be found here.

### 3-140: Beastman Barracks: Canine Konturbs (Dog Company)

* The beastman troopers of Dog Company live in this chamber.
	* Dog Company is the most senior of the beastman units; its troopers smarter and quicker than the others, with the most battle experience.
	* The company is a thorough mix of dog-, pig-, sheep-, goat- and rat-men, all of whom are veterans.
	* They expect, and receive, deference (as well as envy!) from the other companies.
	* A total of 16 beastmen (4 dog-men, 4 pig-men, 3 goat-men, 3 rat-men, 2 sheep-men) are stationed here, organized into two six-beastman banda (patrols).
		* 2 patrol sergeants (one dog-man, one goat-man) and 2 staff sergeants (one pig-man, one rat-man) also live here.
	* One bandon is always on guard at 3-123A. The other patrol is present in the barracks 50% of the time; the rest of the time it will be found in either 3-156, 3-158, 3-161 or one of the harems (3-145 to 3-148).
		* The Staff Sergeants will be present here 50% of the time. 
* The chamber is spartan and neat, with well-ordered bed-mounds surrounding a trestle table at which troopers can play dice, etc.
	* On the east wall is displayed the tattered blue Dog Company banner featuring a mailed fist; hanging from it are very small fragments of equipment, bone, and a few slips of parchment (battle mementos).

	* The company has a communal stone chest by the north wall
		* dried rations, 6 potions of healing, a few extra helmets, etc.
	* A stone water barrel sits next to the chest.
	* A weapons rack next to the door holds spears, shields, and swords. 
* A looted golden idol of Anubis is mounted on a ledge on the south wall (90 lbs, 5000 gp).
	* Human body with a canine head whose mouth is open, displaying sharp teeth.
	* Believing it to be an image of Rex (6-50), the whippet companion to the original imperial kentarchia, the company considers it to be its special mascot.

Each of the beastmen has 3-18 sp.

### 3-141: Beastman Barracks: Ovine Konturbs (Sheep Company)

* The beastman troopers of Sheep Company live in this chamber. 
	* Sheep Company is the most junior company, with the youngest and least tested troopers.
		* Although well trained like all of the Children of Deino, the Ovine troopers tend to be simultaneously more nervous and more aggressive than their senior colleagues (weaker morale, but more likely to attack).
	* A total of 21 beastmen are stationed here: three six-beastman patrols with 3 patrol sergeants.
		* 8 sheep-men, 6 goat-men, 3 dog-men, 3 pig-men, 1 rat-man. The three sergeants are all goat-men. 
	* One bandon is always on guard at 3-123A. Another bandon is always present in the barracks. The third patrol will be found either in the barracks (25%), in the mess hall (25%), with its harem in 3-145 (25%) or training in 3-156 (25%).  
*  The chamber is small and cramped, with rickety wooden bunkbeds arranged in rows across the floor (although the sergeants get single beds).
	* The troop possesses no table.
	* Their banner is significantly newer and less tattered than those of the other companies (the last banner was lost a decade ago in a disastrous expedition to the lower levels). It boasts no battle mementos.
		* Even still, theft of the Sheep Company banner provokes immediate and vengeful retribution.
	* The company has a communal stone chest next to the door
		* dried rations, a contraband jug of wine, a few extra helmets, etc.
	* A stone water barrel sits next to the chest.
	* A weapons rack next to the door holds spears, shields, and swords.
	* Lacking better spoils, the company has decorated its chamber walls with surprisingly high quality painted images of giant beastmen spearing a variety of enemies, including goblins, humans, and, improbably, varumani.

6 or 12 beastman troopers (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LN; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 1+1; HP: 9, 8, 7(x3), 6(x4), 5(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: tactics. Possessions: ring mail and shield; spears; short swords; short bows.

Each of the beastmen has 3-18 sp.

### 3-142: Beastman Barracks: Caprine Konturbs (Goat Company) 

* The beastman troopers of Goat Company live in this chamber.
	* Goat Company ranks third in seniority. Its troopers are a mixed bag, a fair proportion of misfits passed over for promotion, and an equal number of ambitious youngsters hoping to prove their worth and earn promotion to Dog Company.
	* Although an effective unit by most standards, it is the most fractious of the konturbia that make up the Tagma. Given its status, its troopers are equally likely to bully Sheep Company troopers and to cringe in the presence of the veterans of Dog and Pig companies.
	* A total of 28 beastmen are stationed here: four six-beastmen patrols with four patrol sergeants.
		* 8 sheep-men, 7 rat-men, 5 pig-men, 5 dog-men, and 3 goat-men; of the sergeants, 1 is a sheep-man, 2 are pig-men, and one is a dog-man. 
	* Two troopers are always on guard at 3-137B, while a full bandon is always elsewhere in the complex (3-146, 3-156, 3-158 or 3-161). The remaining troopers are always present in barracks.
* The chamber is cramped and crowded with rickety wooden bunkbeds.
	* Although clean, it smells of too many beastmen living in close quarters.
	* Given the cramped conditions, it is common (25%) to find troopers relaxing in the hallway outside their barracks. 
	* The west wall boasts the tattered Sheep Company banner featuring the usual mailed fist; hanging from it are only three battle mementos.
		* Loss of the banner will inspire company morale and will provoke immediate and vengeful retribution.
	* The company has a communal stone chest next to the door
		* dried rations, 2 potions of healing, a few extra helmets, etc.
	* A stone water barrel sits next to the chest.
	* A weapons rack next to the door holds spears, shields, and swords. 
	* The company has recently won some trophies:
		* three stuffed (but smelly) mantari hang from the ceiling
		* a poorly-preserved halfling corpse has been impaled on a spear in the center of the room, allowing the troopers to push it into amusing poses.

16 or 22 beastman troopers (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LN; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 1+1; HP: 9(x3), 8(x4), 7(x4), 6(x7), 5(x4); #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: tactics. Possessions: ring mail and shield; spears; short swords; short bows.

		* The torturer does his work to the west.
		* The eastern half features eight sets of manacles set into the north and east walls, a small round table, and two chairs.

	* He has risen to command of the Tagma through a combination of a genial personality, canny politicking, military skill, and luck.
	* Although he may appear as slightly dim, he is in fact a shrewd judge of personality, and is adept at manipulating beastmen and others to attain his goals. He is exceptionally good at ‘managing’ Deino.  He gives Nikeos much public voice, while privately listening to the more cautious Georgik. In short, he is a very successful commander.

	* Unlike his counterpart, Georgik, Nikeos is an imperialist, constantly urging Skleros to expand the territory of the Tagma and confront their enemies.

	*  Only the most intelligent, self-reliant, and hardy beastmen are selected for service.
		* By temperament the LRCP attracts rat-men, but overall recruitment is by merit.
		* Members rightly see themselves as an elite and have little if anything to do with the regular konturbia; in turn, the Companies (even Dog Company) treat members of the LRCP with elaborate deference. 
	* 8 rat-men, 2 pig-men, 5 dog-men, 3 sheep-men, and 8 goat-men.  The sergeants are 3 rat-men and a goat-man.  They are led by Count Trisko the Natty.
	*  The sole function of the LRCP is the active exploration of the Halls and the acquisition of material and information usable by Tagma Command and Deino
		* Only one patrol is likely to be in residence here at any given time.
		* Above all else, the LRCP is tasked with procuring wood, iron/steel, fresh fruit and vegetables, and the specimens of cloud cap mushrooms that Deino (3-158) requires (see new flora). 
		* These missions take them, naturally, into the Great Cavern (3-163 and 3-172), where cloud caps can be found, but also into the ruins of the city of Arden Vul and sometimes into the valley below.
		* It is the LRCP that makes use of the ‘beastman entrance’ to the Halls, located at 3-189. 
* This chamber features nine bunk beds ranged against the north and south walls, four single beds along the west wall, a long trestle table, and a smaller table.
	* Next to the door is a communal chest, a stone water barrel, and an equipment stand.

* Trisko is the most willing to trade information and even maps with any peaceful visitors his patrols encounter.
* Trisko is especially anxious for the return of his missing bandon, that led by sergeant Histar (currently dwelling in 3-221 as slaves of the greenhag of area 3-204). 

### 3-155: Storage and Supplies

### 3-158: Deino’s Hall

* Soft yellow light, low pastoral sounds, the pleasing tones of a sung ballad, and enticing odors of roasting meat waft from the open door.
* An imposing, 25’-tall hall; the lair of Deino, witch, enchantress, and ‘mother’ to the beastmen of the “Able Ones” (the 3rd cohort of the Imperial Tagmata).
	* The upper register of the walls still has the frescos of a Thothian audience hall: images of ibises, baboons, magical symbols, and cylindrically-hatted priests.
	* Smokeless torches burn in sconces along the walls (see new magic items).
	* The floor is covered with large, overlapping carpets of vibrant colors and dynamic patterns.

			* Dressed in archaic armor and festooned with colorful silk ribbons (remnants of the original 3rd Cohort of the Imperial Tagmata).
	* A 10’ trestle table with benches occupies the center of the chamber
		* Set with pewter plates and settings and silver goblets. Bowls of fruit, plates of marinated meat, and bowls of pickled mushrooms temptingly fill the table.
	* A number of goats, pigs, sheep, dogs, and rats wander about tamely.
	* 2-5 naked (very attractive) members of random species lounge idly.
* Secret Door (south): trapped with a poison needle trap (-5% to disarm). To open, fold up a corner of the carpet and press a small stud, unlocking a panel in the wall.
	* The panel slides both ways, and is trapped (-5% to detect).
	* Sliding it to the left releases a poison needle; sliding to the right avoids the trap. 

* Armoire
	* 10 sets of filmy silk garments, perfect for snuggling with Deino.
	* Worn adventuring gear (clothing, belts, sacks - no armor or weapons) that used to belong to her current playthings.
	* Memorial Codex of the Cult of Thoth (stolen from 3-65)
	* In the back of the armoire is a large, silver box.
		* Box is locked and trapped with a poison needle (save vs poison or die; 2d6 even on success).
		* three scrolls (1: pyrotechnics, tongues, polymorph self; 2: fumble, conjure elemental, passwall; 3: airy water, globe of invulnerability, power word stun)
		* a set of six colored glass activation squares for use in 3-159
		* 19 doses of Rastite lotus powder (flora)
		* A vial of hot red liquid. (Deino's phylactery)
			* It contains Deino’s life essence; if emptied / smashed, she will be unable to regenerate.

* Tripods: The basin of each bronze tripod of heating (new) contains a different substance:
	* Tripod 1: Meat stew.
		* A more savory form of the beastmen’s cavern stew, Deino feeds this tasty fare to her playthings and any visiting beastmen.
	* Tripod 2: Syrupy golden mead, brewed from a variety of mushrooms and vital fluids garnered in the Halls
		* One special ingredient, Rastite lotus powder (flora).
		* When enchanted by Deino, this produces a delicious mead, with strong soporific qualities (-2 saves in humans for an hour for each glass imbibed)
		* It also acts to mask most powers of vampires, a property Thegan White-Mane used to subdue Isocorax (see 6-20).
	* Tripod 3: Transformation wine.
		* This purplish liquor gives off a faint odor of granite, blackberries, and wild game.
		* Its secret ingredient is cloud cap mushrooms (flora).
		* Anyone drinking a mug of this will be transformed into an animal: 1=pig, 2=dog, 3=goat, 4=rat, 5=sheep, 6=unholy combination of all three.
			* The transformation is permanent, but can be removed by dispel magic.
	* Tripod 4: ‘Mother’s milk’.
		* This thick, viscous, yogurt-like substance smells of pine nuts.
		* It tastes delicious, but is in fact deadly poison and will kill all those who don’t save at -1.
		* Deino uses this to end the lives of playthings and animals of which she has tired, and to grant a painless end to elderly beastmen.
	* Tripod 5: Elixir of life.
		* A thin, watery, whitish liquid that smells and tastes of mint and, strangely, of pepper.
		* Deino extracts this from corpses and combines it with special ingredients to form the basis of both transformation wine and her own phylactery.
			* When cloud caps are added, it becomes transformation wine.
			* When Deino adds her own blood, it turns red and is used for her phylactery.

Deino the Witch
* An ancient, quasi-immortal enchantress whose mastery of seduction and charms would be legendary were it more widely known.
	* She was a priestess of Isis in centuries gone, and learned to keep herself alive through secret and complex alchemy.
* She appears as an attractive nut-brown woman with raven hair and coal-black eyes.
	* She dresses in a loose tunic of pale yellow, secured with a belt of large pearls, from which hangs a slim knife.  She wears a large opal ring. 

Deino determines whether visitors should be charmed, attacked, or invited to negotiate.
* Deino loves to seduce and charm attractive members of any gender and humanoid species.
	* Once under her thumb, she cavorts with them until she tires of them, after which she turns them into animals (using her potions and ring). 
* Deino warmly greets any group composed of at least one attractive member (CHA 14+), inviting them (and their friends) to join her feast.
	* She apologizes for her beastmen (if they have attacked the party), attributing any combat to their jealousy and protective nature.
	* Genuinely interested in tales of her guests’ adventures, she begs for news of adventure, clapping and ‘ooh’-ing approvingly during any story telling.
	* As the festivities continue, Deino plies the guests with her (drugged) food and drink and eventually offers to tell her own story, at which point she finally attempts to charm guests with her song; she sings delightfully, in a slightly haunting manner that compels attention (-1 to saves).
	* Attractive individuals (CHA 14 or more) who are charmed are kept as playthings for 2d6 months; others are transformed into animals.
* Should guests prove hostile, or should a group include no desirable males, she summons all her forces (zombies, animals, and charmed men) to defend her.

Deino is interested in...
* Acquiring large quantities of cloud cap mushrooms (available in the Great Cavern, i.e., 3-163 and 3-172)
* Locating the remains of Gennadius and Rex (Gennadius’s remains are found at 8-41 and Rex’s can be found at 6-50).
* Information about the cult of Set.
* Information about pa'ut, homunculi, ancient Isis and Thoth lore.

Deino leaves most tactical and daily decisions to her counts. Only larger matters of strategy and policy are brought to her attention.

The beastmen are fully aware of Deino’s nature, and of the cruel fate reserved for most guests.  Still, she is their ‘mother’, and they will defend her fiercely.
* If the party has befriended senior beastmen, they may offer a warning, either direct (“Avoid Deino’s hall completely!”) or indirect (“Careful what you drink in Deino’s hall …”).
* Strangers or enemies receive no such warning.
* Those who attack Deino instantly become mortal enemies to the Tagma.

Deino has a close relationship with Thegan White-Mane (6-20), host of the Inn of the Lost.
* She relies on him to procure rare ingredients for her brews (especially Rastite lotus powder).
* In return, she supplies him with her syrupy golden mead, allowing him to continue to subdue Isocorax (see 6-20).
* Interrupting this trade would seriously weaken (if not endanger) both parties, and so both take pains to support and promote the interests of the other. 

### 3-159: Commons

* This chamber retains its (magical) coat of bright yellow paint studded with pale-blue and white ibises.
	* Tagma Command designated this chamber for off-duty relaxation, but the beastmen consider the paint job ugly and few use it. Even the furniture designated for this chamber has been ‘re-assigned.’
	* (Futile) paint removal in this chamber is a classic punishment detail.  The paint regenerates soon after.
* In the northwest corner lies a Thothian teleportation ring (address: YE-BL-GR-WH-BK-RE).
	* The beastmen are ignorant of its nature.
	* Deino knows and possesses a full set of the squares (in her armoire) and knows the addresses to AV-29, 1-19, 2-42, and 3-33.  She has not used the ring in decades.

### 3-160: Beastman Barracks: Veterans’ Hall

* Elder beastmen unable to serve in patrols linger here.
	* More ferocious ones seek glorious death in the Arena, more capable ones are promoted to leadership.  These are the rest.

	* If the trap at 3-57 sounds, they summon a patrol from one of the other companies (arriving within 1 turn).
* There are eight sleeping pallets here, and a weapons rack with some ancient spears and chipped swords.
* The north door is heavily barred and has a small barred viewport at beastman eye-level.

	* A huge cauldron simmers over the firepit, filled with "cavern stew" (a noxious mix of mushrooms, monkey meat, other meat (when available), lichen, moss, etc.
		* The cook prefers to use wood for the fire, but must frequently rely on the dried stems of giant mushrooms.
		* A crude ‘chimney’ vents to an upper cave and into the Great Cavern near 163b.
	* The head cook and her six assistants toil here 18 hours a day in noisy, hot conditions.
		* Many pots, pans, ladles, spoons, and knives are present and in heavy use.

### 3-162: Varumani Advisors

* Two emissaries from the troll thegn (7-30) have been sent to advise (and observe) the Children of Deino.
	* If no alert has been sounded, the varumani are here (20%), the mess hall at 3-161 (25%), or Deino’s Hall (3-158; 55%).
		* The emissaries are lazy and not particularly interested in protecting the beastmen (25% chance they ignore any call for aid).
		* If they suspect the beastmen are going to be defeated, they retreat to 3-159 and use the teleportation ring to teleport to 6-64 (the only address they know).
* Their chamber holds two huge piles of fur, a water barrel, a table (with some fist-sized dice, a sausage, two tankards, a small barrel of beer), and a locked wooden chest.
	* Chest: 576 sp, 626 gp, 2 troll thegn’s passports (Arden items), a silver rod (to  open the doors at 5-6E), a full set of 6 glass activation squares, a pair of solid gold goblets (stolen from the beastmen, 125 gp each).

### 3-163: Great Cavern, Northern Portion

* This iconic location is renowned through the upper levels of Arden Vul.
* Luxuriant mushroom groves, a prolific (and nutritious!) troop of albino monkeys, numerous species of lizard and cave insect, and several noteworthy physical features, including a river, some falls, a lake, and a 50’ cliff.
	* The northern section (3-163) connects to the precincts of the beastmen (3-137 to 3-162), and to the river caves and other complexes.
	* The southern half (3-172) holds several ancient tombs and artifacts, and eventually leads to the exterior via a tunnel system.
	* The cavern floor along the river below the falls (3-164B) is 25’ above the level of the river.
* The ceiling averages 60-80’ in height.
* The temperature of the cavern is warm and humid.

	* The areas by the cliff (3-163C), lake, and the tops of the rock formations (3-174, 3-178, and 3-179), are pretty dark.
	* Anyone emerging from 3-154, 3-156, or 3-227 will see a low orange glow emerging from a stand of enormous mushrooms (10’ to 15’ tall). 
* There is a hum of insect activity, as well as the occasional moaning of breezes, plops of liquid from mushroom caps, and an occasional thrashing sound (prey being snatched).
	* The sound of the falls (3-164B) is loud once one has descended the cliff.

Kerbog Khan (SL12-25) regularly sends his dragonfly and explorer automatons to the great cavern to observe the denizens and gather specimens.
* 5% cumulative chance per hour spent in the cavern of encountering an automaton.
	* d6: 1-2 dragonfly automaton; 3-4: poison dragonfly automaton; 5: basic explorer automaton; 6: bipedal explorer automaton.
		* 33% chance that the Khan is inhabiting the automaton (75% on subsequent encounters).

##### 3-163a: Observation Cage

* The priests of Thoth constructed a 15' high, steel observation cage here, affording them an observation and collection zone.
	* North wall small steel door (locked, +10% to pick, freshly oiled).
* The beastmen of the Long Range Cavern Patrol have stacked several boxes near the door on the north wall.
	* Dried rations, filled water skins, 6 flasks of oil, a dozen torches.
	* A pail of a noxious smelling, greyish paste (made of mushrooms and other cave detritus).  Smeared on a torch, its smell repels giant centipedes.
		* Needed as the LRCP  rappels down the cliff face at 3-163c.

##### 3-163b: Feeding Station

* A locked steel door separates 3-156a from a stone bridge (5' wide, 15' above the cavern floor) extending out into the great cavern.
	* The bridge ends in a 5’x10’ platform from which the priests used to feed the monkeys and other small animals.
		* A rickety-looking but serviceable ladder is propped against the platform.
		* The cavern floor near the platform is dense with a variety of giant mushrooms, and the air is filled with chattering of monkeys and buzzing of dragonflies. 

##### 3-163c: Cliff

* Running across the northern edge of the Great Cavern is a sheer cliff dropping 50’ to the level of the lake (3-164).
	* Rocky and relatively easy to climb (+15% to climb rolls).

	* Small caves and holes in the cliff face house albino monkeys, various small insects, and numerous giant centipedes.
		* 50% chance that climbers are attacked by 3-4 giant centipedes.
		* 33% if descending quickly on ropes.
		* The foul paste at 3-163a, or Lankios's goo, wards off the centipedes.

18 giant centipedes, in groups of 3-4: SZ S; AL N; AC 9; MV 150’; HD 1 or 2 HP; HP 2(x9), 1(x9); #AT 1; Dmg n.a. Special attacks: poison (+4 to save).

##### 3-163d: Fungal Forest

* All of the open areas, both above and below the cliff, are filled with specimens of colossal mushrooms that grow 10’ to 15’ in height.
	* All of the colossal species in the new flora appendix are found here: orange lamps, white ribs, blue trumpets, eye-openers, cloud caps, and white bulbs.
	* Paths allowing relatively normal movement are marked with dashes.
	* Outside a paths, the forest is densely packed; half movement rate.
	* In the forest direction is quite difficult to maintain (roll 6d4+2 under WIS or make a tracking check, to maintain the proper direction).
	* There is a 5’ gap between the cavern walls and the edge of the fungal forest, so it can be circumnavigated by hugging the cave walls, but the mushrooms grow right up to the cliff and water edges.

Searching the Fungal Forest: 
* Nothing of interest will be found on the path.
* For each turn foraging in the forest, 1 in 6 chance of finding something interesting:

				* Elaborate, with solid gold head decorated with lapis, sapphires, and black onyx (intact 10,000 gp, broken up for gems and metal 2000 gp).
				* Inside is Ptarmis' fungal mummy (new).
					* Once the lid of the sarcophagus is moved, Ptarmis opens his case and rises to confront the intruders.
					* GM Note: Ptarmis’s fear aura might drive some intruders to run off the edge of the rock outcrop (4d6 fall damage thanks to the great mushrooms around the outcropping, softening the fall).
				* Inside the case: three gems (500 gp each), 1,079 ancient silver pennies, a pair of keys to the hematite doors (3-177), black and red glass activation squares, a jar with 3 doses of stone salve (new), and an amulet versus undead (7th level).

### 3-175: Elevated Parvis

* The paved area (parvis) rises about 20’ above the rest of the cavern.
	* Anyone on the parvis has a fairly good view over some parts of the fungal forest.
	* The parvis is made of old, cracked, chipped, and dirty white marble pavers identical to the parvis in 3-177.
	* Black hematite doors lead to 3-177 (see that location for details).
		* Speaking any of the seven secret names of Thoth (see Secreta Secretorum) produces keyholes.  See 3-177 for key location.
	* Four pairs of stone pillars that rise 30’, but do not reach the ceiling of the cavern (unlike their counterparts in 3-177). 

Note: The parvis is one destination for the one-way teleporter in UP-11.
* Arrivals find themselves on the pavement looking north at the gargantuan chair at 3-176.

### 3-176: Pavilion and Gargantuan Chair

* At the northern end of the parvis, three wide steps rise 10' (thus 30' above the cavern floor) to an imposing pavilion.
	* The sides and rear of the pavilion are 20 slim (2’-wide) black marble pillars rising 20’, but not supporting a roof.
	* In the center of the pavilion is a gargantuan seat, 10’ wide by 10’ deep by 10’ high, carved completely out of single block of red jasper.
		* Left and right of the chair are two more 20’-tall, black marble columns.
		* A human in dirty brown robes sits uneasily in the chair (Trocadero).
	* The floor of the pavilion is the same cracked white marble of the parvis, save for the impressive mosaics laid out directly in front of the chair.
		* Ptarmis of Thoth (3-174) installed 3 living mosaics on the pavilion in front of the Great Chair when he discovered this cavern.
		* Mosaic #1: shows the Long Stair near EX-11.
			* 25% chance of a group on the Stair (roll a random encounter for EX). If a beastman, 75% chance they are entering the Halls at 3-189 (EX-11).
		* Mosaic #2: shows 3-163a (a section of the Great Cavern with bars near it).
			* 15% chance of a creature in the scene.
		* Mosaic #3: shows the Glory of Thoth (3-2). 
			* 33% chance of a creature in the scene: if so, it will be 1-3: roll random encounter, 4-5: adventurers, 6: cloaked figures (Set cultists).
		* Trocadero discovered a loose marble paver and stashed his treasure there.
			* 2 potions of plant control, 2 potions of extra healing, 650 gp, an alabaster figurine of a cat (100 gp), a gaudy gold and sapphire ring (300 gp), and a large amethyst (400 gp).

Mad Wizard
* Trocadero is a middle-aged human magic user (45 years old) who has been driven insane by the amulet that he found, now believing himself the reincarnation of Ptarmis and the natural custodian of the fungal forest.
* Trocadero spends his time walking through the forest (50%) or sitting on ‘his’ seat (50%).
* He is quite mad, but is not necessarily aggressive.
	* He refers to himself in the third person as Lord Ptarmis, and gestures grandly at his dominion.
	* He listens to petitions so long as the petitioners are polite and offer him respect and deference.
		* Only if the PCs insist on searching the pavilion, or if they show signs of having killed any fungal foresters, or if they insult “Lord Ptarmis” to his face, will Trocadero attack.
	* His first action is to ring a nonmagical silver bell, alerting the fungal foresters, to his need.  They begin arriving (one per round) after 3 rounds. He then uses his spells to maximum effect, alternating between defense and offense. A favorite strategy is to cast fly, shield, and then fireball.

Trocadero of Newmarket, 6th-level male Archontean magic user: SZ M; AL NE; AC 8; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 19; #AT 1; Dmg: 1-4 (dagger). Abilities: STR 8, INT 17, WIS 11, DEX 16, CON 12, CHA 13.

### 3-177: Cave of the Hematite Doors

* This large cave has been partially worked and improved.
	* The floor for 35’ in front of the doors has been smoothed and laid with large (5’x5’) pavers of white marble.
	* Six slim (4’ diameter) natural stone pillars extend to the ceiling (turning to unshaped rock at the top 10’ of height).
	* The western wall is finished, once plastered but now only a few shreds of plaster hang on the wall.
	* The east wall is unfinished rock. 
	* The north wall is fitted stone surrounding two enormous (15’) black doors.
		* The wall includes two of the stone pillars (the masonry fitted to 2 pillars).
		* The wall was originally plastered, but, like the west wall, is now entirely bare. 

The Hematite Doors
* The doors are black hematite, inscribed with arcane symbols glowing with a gentle, pulsating purple light.
	* The symbols include an ankh on each door, a feather on the western door and an ibis on the eastern.
	* An inscription runs across the top of both doors (Mithric): “Speak One of the Seven to Enter the Domain of Ptarmis.”
	* No obvious keyholes or locks, but the doors are quite immovable.
	* Anyone who passes successfully through the doors is Blessed for 1 day.
* Speaking aloud one of the seven secret names of Thoth (see Secreta Secretorum) causes a keyhole to appear in each valve.
	* Each requires a large (1’) bronze key (2-23, 3-174, 4-2, 4-158, 5-17, and 5-39).
	* Without the keys, the doors will be almost impossible to open.
	* A knock spell causes the keyholes to appear, but will not open the door.
	* The only alternative to the keys is traversing the eastern tunnels (3-180 to 3-184). 

Arcane Sigils on the Doors
* Tracing any of the sigils on the door produces a magical effect.
	* If the tracer is carries a holy symbol of Set they are blasted for 2-8 lightning.
	* Either ankh grants a blessing (+1 attack and damage for 1d3+3 hours)
	* The feather provides a +4 AC against undead for 4-6 hours
	* The ibis grants comprehend languages for 4-6 hours.
* Once a sigil is traced, it ceases to glow for 1d4 days, before it glows again and can impart its powers.

### 3-178: Accursed Pillar 

* The accursed pillar of Rimmaq-Isfet stands atop a rock formation, 40’ above the floor of the great cavern.
	* It is one of the most ancient icons of the complex, carved millennia ago during the height of heqeti dominance over the Halls.
		* GM Note: A similar pillar may be found at 9-135.
	* It may be difficult for unsuspecting cavern crawlers to notice it unless they are examining the ceiling carefully.
	* Rising 15’ above the formation and 8’ in diameter, the pillar is carved in a spiral fashion with scenes showing the triumph of the heqeti followers of Rimmaq-Isfet.
		* Many of these carvings are now worn to little more than faceless lumps.
		* The column radiates obvious and brooding evil, and a chill 5’ radius around it.
		* Touching the column gates in a keqemander demon to confront the intruders.
		* Examining the carvings causes dizziness, and possibly confusion (save vs. spells to avoid).  Those able to keep their eyes on the pillar may learn something:
			* It takes an hour of scrutiny to learn all of this information.
			* Anyone who gleans even one piece of information gains:
				* A flat 50% chance of recognizing the origin of Kauket artifacts and structures found elsewhere in Halls (e.g. pukel-manders, tears of Kauket, etc.)
				* A flat 33% chance of intuiting a relationship between Rimmaq-Isfet and Kauket.
				* Such an ability does not allow one to intuit specific uses or functions.

D10 Result

A colossal salamander fills the top of the pillar. It has multiple legs, and an enormous mouth filled with teeth and circled with a ‘beard’ of feelers/tentacles. Three lidless eyes span its massive brow.

3-4
Hopping salamander-headed bipeds wreak destruction on lizards.

5-6
Humans in chains are driven into the maw of a giant amphibian.

7-8
The boundary separating the spiraling narratives is in fact a tongue.

### 3-179: Mysterious Hole, w/ access to 5-141

* The rock formation rises another 20’ in height from the accursed pillar (3-178).
	* Its pinnacle (60’ above the cavern floor, 10’ from the ceiling) has a 5’-diameter hole extending downward 80’ before opening into a small unmapped cavern.
	* This cave (20’ wide, 8’ to 15’ high) snakes over uneven rocky floors 80’ towards the north. It is cool and dry, a suitable place for resting.
		* In the extreme north corner is another 5’ hole extending down 170’ to 5-141.
		* A midnight rose plant grows next to the hole (flora).
		* The cave contains a cache of food.
			* 4 lb of dried fruit (unusual but edible), 1 lb of dried meat (now leathery), 2 orange plastic flasks of water.  Discarded beside the cache are two 1” rudishva lesser power supplies (3 charges each).
			* Carved on the wall near the cache is (Varumani Semi-glyphik) “Betrayed by the kaliyani, the varumani flee. Our Lords help us not. They are thrown down. Let us follow the thegn.” 

GM Note
* The holes that connect 3-179 to 5-141 were delved by the varumani as they sought escape from the collapse of the rudishva hegemony over the halls.
* The note points to the culpability of the kaliyani in this disaster.
* Alerting the current troll thegn (7-30) to the content and location of the inscription gives +20% initial reaction bonus, and a reward of 250 gp.

### 3-180: Damp Caverns

* The walls of these three caves are slick with moisture, and the temperature in them is about 10 degrees warmer than the surrounding caves.  The floors are muddy sand and gravel.
	* At A, the beastmen have placed a broken spear haft with a decomposing baboon head impaled on it as a warning.
	* A column of magical fire crackling merrily at B has attracted 3 fire mephits, who frolic at C. 
		* The mephits smoke sticks made of dried and pressed eye-opener mushrooms (flora). They are dressed in strange costumes: heavy purple velvet smoking jackets, orange top hats, and ankle boots with 3” heels. 
		* They have a silver case (25 gp) containing 12 eye-opener ‘cigarettes’, which  function just as the fresh variety (flora).

3 fire mephits: SZ M; AL NE; AC 5; MV 120’, 240’ flying (Class B); HD 3+1; HP 23, 22, 20; #AT 2; Dmg 2-4/2-4. Special attacks: flame shroud around body; breath weapon 3/day; heat metal 1/day; magic missile (2 missiles) 1/day; gate (25% chance, once per hour).

* Mephit skin may also be sold to wizards for magical research.

## Level 3: 181 - 195

### 3-181: Hidden Side Cave

* The entrance to this side cave is a 3’-diameter hole located 5’ above the tunnel floor.
	* It is easily found by those proceeding slowly or cautiously.
* The tunnel is small and narrow at first, but opens up to 5’ wide by 8’ tall before emerging in a 10’ by 10’ cave.
	* Inside the cave is the body of an elven magic user, long dead and decomposed.
		* A wooden staff capped with iron, leather pouch with a 50 gp beryl and a 100 gp aquamarine. 
	* A colony of 4 feral house cats led by the former familiar of the wizard make their nest here.
		* They prowl in 3-172 for insects and other small prey, and hide in this cave to escape larger predators. It might be possible to adopt one or more of them.
		* The familiar is female, had sex with a tomcat from the Bast temple, had kittens after the mage's death, while waiting here.

4 wild cats: SZ S; AL N; AC 5; MV 180’; HD 1; HP 6, 4, 3, 2; #AT 3; Dmg 1-2/1-2/1-2. Special attacks: rear claw rakes; surprise 3 in 6. Special defenses: only surprised 1 in 6.

### 3-182: Empty Cave

	* Their lair proper is in the western protrusion.
		* Two 10-lb silver ingots (50 gp each), a misshapen stone head of a snake-creature (one of the bas-reliefs from 3-192f), a potion of flying, and one boot from a pair of elven boots (the other is at 1-18).
	* 50% chance that some reptiles are present (d10): 1-4=1 rock reptile, 5-8=2 rock reptiles, 9-10= 3 rock reptiles.

X / 42
X / 40

### 3-184: Cave-In

* An enormous, impassable rock fall blocks the passage.
* Just beyond the cave-in is a short tunnel to 3-172, exiting 25’ above the floor of the Great Cavern.

### 3-185: Lost Goblins

* The remnant of a goblin expeditionary party lurks in this cave.
	* Only three goblins remain, under the command of the charismatic sub-chief, Bellringer (fluent in Archontean), and they are nervous and excitable.
	* They are quite willing to parlay, especially if offered food and assistance.
	* The bodies of three dead companions are stashed down the narrow passageway. 
	* 35 sp, 61 cp, and two dead giant centipedes (poison glands could be extracted).

The Goblins’ Story
* Flushed with a minor gladiatorial victory at the Arena (6-68), the team of goblins decided they were fated to discover the whereabouts of Gribble, King Weskenim’s missing brother.  They left the Arena area (6-67), climbed to 4-161, and located the stairs to 3-172 (via 4-159).
	* Gribble is currently in the prison of Set at 3-105.
* Once in the Great Cavern (3-172), Bellringer and his men were ambushed by the beastmen of the Long Range Cavern Patrol (3-154) and almost annihilated.
	* They fled east, and located this cave, where they plan their next move. They gladly trade information for food and assistance in returning to 4-159.

### 3-186: Crossroads and a Giant Boulder

* A giant boulder (15' high, 22' wide) rests on the floor of this crossroads.
	* Might not be immediately obvious the boulder isn't connected to the ceiling (20-25' above).
	* Subtle chiseled footholds on the north face of the boulder allow easy access to the top of the boulder.
		* Here is a a flattened space, the cold ashes of a cooking fire, and several battered iron pots and cauldrons.
		* A small patch of aqua vitae mushrooms (flora) has taken root in some dirt and dust accumulated in a shallow depression on the rock.
			* Currently there are 8 ripe mushrooms. Every 1-3 months a new crop of mushrooms will spring up here.
		* The campsite on the boulder is relatively safe, with a good view of all approaching tunnels, and of the hematite doors at 3-177 (which are clearly visible due to the magical light there).

### 3-187: Empty Cave

* This cave is little more than a widening of the tunnel.
	* Two beastmen corpses lie moldering in the small spur to the north. 
		* Badly decomposed and carry nothing of value. 
		* 10% a carcass creeper is found here.

1 carcass creeper (10% chance): SZ L; AL N; AC 3 (head) or 7 (body); MV 120’; HD 3+1; HP 20; #AT 8; Dmg nil. Special attacks: paralysis.

### 3-188: Crossroads

* Three tunnels converge at this point, and a fourth appears to lead to the north.
	* The fourth passage leads to a small cave whose far wall has been smoothed flat and carved into a Sortian face (new), activated by placing Sortian eyes in the empty eye sockets. 
		* Combinations are standard, except:
			* Gold-Gold: Teleportation
				* All within 5’ are teleported to area 6-48
			* Gold-Sapphire: A permanent magic mouth speaks (Mithric):
				* All those with the spark must be trained, regardless of their origin. The empire will be better for it. Once you have found a suitable recruit, visit the sanctum so that training may commence. Recall that proper vision comes only with yellow or blue eyes. I, Priscus the Hekate, have spoken! Oh, and if exigency requires it, you may seek our outpost along the wall of the chasm, near where the falls crash to the floor. Do not alert the Theosophs to your passage!
					* GM Note: This message is a hint as to the original, egalitarian message of the Sortians, and especially Priscus Pulcher. The outpost is to be found at areas 9-58 to 9-64.
		* This cave is also the destination for the Sortian face in 6-48. 

### 3-189 (aka EX-11): Secret Door to Exterior

* This secret door deposits travelers outside the Halls, onto the upper reaches of the Long Stair at a point 1,150’ from the valley floor or 350’ below the plateau.
	* The door is stone, easy to discern from the inside (1 in 3).
	* It is the primary route used by the beastmen of the Long Range Cavern Patrol (3-154) to access the ruined city of Arden Vul (AV) and the valley of the Swift River. 
* Trackers will easily notice signs of traffic here, particularly of small feet (the beastmen). Much graffiti is scrawled on the walls near the secret door.

### 3-191: Empty Cave?

* First impressions suggest an empty natural cave.
	* The western wall is illusory (marked by dotted lines).
		* A tracker might (+5% chance) notice tracks leading towards the illusory wall.
		* Klisko Lightfingers, a human illusionist, was badly burned in the battle that took place in 3-192, and retreated here in shock to recuperate.
			* Most of his possessions, including 3/4 of his spell book, were destroyed in the conflagration.  He cast hallucinatory terrain to make the room appear smaller.  Behind the illusion, he applied a medicinal paste to his burned face and scalp and fell asleep on his bedroll.
			* Klisko will be cautious, backing away, mumbling vague threats and warnings about fire.
			* If cured, he pretends to join his rescuers but betrays them as soon as possible. 
			* Klisko freely relates what happened in 3-192, (including the fire trap) hoping to ingratiate himself with his rescuers.
			* He and his team knew one of the secret names of Thoth (#4: Light of Comprehension) and suspected the location of the tomb of Lycandus (3-197). He might barter this information for assistance in exiting the Halls.

Klisko Lightfingers, 5th-level male Archontean illusionist: SZ M; AL NE; MV 120’; AC 5; HD 5; HP 4 (Max 14); #AT 1; Dmg 1-4 (throwing daggers). Abilities: STR 10, INT 17, WIS 14, DEX

### 3-192: Hall of Unease

* An elaborately carved and decorated chamber predating the Archonteans, though substantially modified and redecorated on numerous occasions.
	* Originally accessed through stone doors to 3-172; they are now buried under several tons of rubble from a cave-in caused by the adventuring parties.
	* A secondary access route was gnawed or delved by unknown hands some centuries past; it leads by a twisty path to the tunnels near 3-188 and 3-191.
* The chamber contains an ancient, timeworn statue, six decapitated bas-relief figures, and five sarcophagi of more recent (but still centuries-old) vintage.
	* The statue is badly eroded by time, its features hard to discern.  Bipedal and human-sized, its head looks strangely large and nonhuman.
		* Highly faceted amber gems serve as over-sized eyes (500 gp each).
		* Touching the gems causes a roaring noise for 3 rounds before a random effect is unleashed.  Can be provoked multiple time.
	* The bas-reliefs are ancient, and extremely worn.
		* Along the eastern ell are six 2’ daises supporting bas-relief figures of salamander-like humanoids. The heads of 5 of the 6 have been struck off.
		* The sixth is intact, and represents a bipedal figure with bulbous eyes, slit nose, and an oversized mouth (a heqeti).
		* The walls featured low bas-reliefs of figures struggling in coiling, writhing masses; erosion and desecration obscure them, but they seem vaguely reptilian.
			* In a few places it seems as if large snakes or lizards are devouring multitudes of smaller figures.
			* Studying the walls for more than a few of rounds (e.g. searching for secret doors) provokes a sense of unease (-1 to saves vs fear for 1d4 hours).
	* The three sarcophagi in the center of the chamber are ancient, dating to the earliest period of the Archontean Empire (4' tall x 6' long x 3' wide).
		* All three lids were smashed long ago, and the remains dispersed.
		* The exteriors are carved in a simplistic style with rude scenes of dragons devastating an idealized countryside.
	* The two sarcophagi that against the northeast and southeast walls are more recent, dating to the attempted recolonization of the Halls some 250 years ago.
		* Plain sides and an elaborate, well-carved gisant of an imperial legionary on their top.
		* The northeastern sarcophagus is smashed open, its contents dispersed.
		* The southeastern one is intact (open doors check and a prybar open).
			* Inside is a skeleton of an Archontean legionary, still accoutered in tarnished mail and conical helm, with a serrated sword.
			* The skeleton clambers out of the sarcophagus and attacks. 
			* 6 ancient octagonal platinum coins, a bone scroll case with 3 spells (spider climb, continual light, and gust of wind), and a jade necklace worth 275 gp.
* The Hall has been the site of a destructive battle in the very recent past.
	* 9 adventurer corpses litter the room, 6 badly scorched by tremendous heat.
		* The most badly burned body lies directly in front of the statue.
		* The 3 less badly scorched corpses were crouched behind the sarcophagi in the center of the chamber when they died.
	* Two adventuring parties got into an argument.  In the midst, one thief manipulated the statue, provoking the fireball that annihilated the parties and caused the cave-in over the exit to 3-172.
	* On the dead adventurers: a total of 143 sp, 71 gp, 219 cp; a hammer +1; a dagger +2; a potion of fire resistance; a potion of climbing; usable long swords (x3), mace, daggers (x6); a lump of melted silver (56 gp, formerly a statuette); and various charred bits of equipment.

D6 Effect
* 1-2) Two bolts of electricity strike one of the PCs, inflicting 2-8 each
* 3-4) A cloud of acidic gas emerges from the ceiling. Everyone in the hall must save vs poison (1d10 on success, failed w/in 5 of the target number 2d8 damage and blindness for 1d4 turns, fail by 5 or more, take 3d8 damage and blindness for 1d4 days
* 5-6) Fireball at level 9 (9d6)

1 skeleton: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1; HP 7; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special defenses: immune to sleep, charm, hold, and cold; cutting and piercing weapons do half damage.

### 3-193: Set’s Landing

* Twenty-five feet up the west wall of the great cavern is a small landing leading west to a 5’-wide passageway.
	* The landing has a low balustrade of simple stone columns to which is attached a long rope ladder (coiled, but reaching the cavern floor when unrolled).
	* Three Set guardsmen with bows lounge on the landing, watching the cavern.
* The landing is the only sure way to access Level 4 (via 3-212) from the southern part of Level 3, and the priests of Set are increasingly anxious to control it.
	* If combat breaks out here, there is a 50% chance that the guardsmen in 3-195 hear and arrive to aid their comrades in 3-5 rounds.

4 Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 2nd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 17, 15, 12; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow). Special defense: fanaticism. Possessions: red scale mail and wooden shield; footman’s maces; spears; light crossbows with 20 bolts.

### 3-194: Storage Chamber

* A small chamber, unpainted and rather drab.

		* Not worth much in absolute terms, but valuable as food and pharmacological resources to any of the intelligent communities in the Halls.
		* Recognizable as stolen from Set if sold in the Forum of Set.
	* At the bottom of one sack is a silver plaque engraved with a sheep’s head (50 gp).
		* A symbol of the 2nd legion (Sheep’s Head Rangers), which foundered in Arden Vul 250 years ago).

### 3-195: Cozy Chamber

* The narrow corridor from 3-194 ends in this large chamber, with a high ceiling painted with stars in the shape of the manta constellation.
	* By the east wall, a fireplace crackles with burning mushroom stalks.
	* Four leather easy chairs (50 gp each), a silk settee (55 gp), a plush green carpet (25 gp), a set of brass candelabra and eating utensils (35 gp total), a keg of brandy (25 gp), and two barrels of water are arranged in front of the fireplace.
		* Stephania, high priestess of Set (4-51), has furnished the room in a relatively luxurious manner as a ‘reward’ to her minions for taking up this distant and dangerous posting.
		* Still, the guardsmen posted here are jumpy and alert, with a 20% chance of fleeing to the north if they hear loud and/or ominous sounds emanating from the east.
	* Several simple wooden benches, one battered easy chair, and two barrels of water complete the chamber.

3 Set guardsmen (see new monsters), as 2nd-level Archontean fighters: SZ M; AL LE; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 18, 15, 12; #AT 1, Dmg 2-7 (mace), 1-6 (spear) and 1-4 (light crossbow).

## Level 3: 196 - 210

### 3-196: Empty (?) Cave

* This 35’-tall, river-carved cavern appears to be empty save for dripping stalactites and a thin layer of sand. The cave is quite damp and moist.
	* The passage to Lycandus’s tomb (3-197) is 25’ up on the south wall, concealed by an illusion (can't be dispelled by less than a 15th-level mage).
	* Past the illusion, in the south-leading tunnel, an enormous complex knot is carved on the tunnel wall (a symbol of the Sortians).
	* The door to 3-197 is worked stone without any evident keyhole.
		* GM Note: Successfully manipulating the pillars at 3-209 allows PCs to see through this illusion.
		* An invisible stalker waits here, still hoping to fulfill its Sortian master’s last wishes. It attacks intruders but won’t pursue outside the cave.

X / 56

### 3-197: Tomb of Lycandus

* Both doors to the chamber are stone, with Sortian faces carved onto them.
	* A close-cropped, bearded male face of late middle age, complete with age lines, crow’s feet, blemishes, and empty sockets where the eyes should be.
	* If activated with gold and/or silver Sortian eyes, the doors unlock, and are impregnable otherwise.
* The tomb proper is a glittering rococo display of gold, silver, and precious gems.
	* Entering triggers a magic mouth to bellow (Mithric) "Lycandus, Prince of Princes, Master of the Eyes, lies here in eternal glory amid his rightful possessions.  Let him be, lest you incur the wrath of Priscus Pulcher, who protects his friends even unto death."
	* Plastered walls show gilt images of nondescript humans doing ordinary activities; with eyes of sapphires.
	* The ceiling has an elaborate fresco of winged beings cavorting in the clouds.
	* An enormous sarcophagus carved from a solid block of porphyry lies in the center of the room, 18’ long, by 9’ wide, incised with arcane symbols filled with silver.
		* Within is only a bare skeleton.
	* Stone tables on the west and south are laden with piles of gold and silver coins and  serving pieces.
	* All of these riches are illusory (powerful, -3 to saves).
		* The ancient Sortians eschewed gaudy display and hierarchy; the illusion is an obvious incongruity to any familiar with the history of the Sortians.
		* One can carry away the glamoured wealth: 15,000 ancient gold solidi, 20,000 ancient silver pennies, 10-20 pieces of silver plate, 100 small sapphires from the walls, etc.  After 24 hours this wealth turn turns to dross, glass, etc.
* For those who disbelieve the illusion, there is only a dusty stone chamber empty save for the two stone tables and a bas-relief covering the south wall.
	* The bas-relief is of a huge and sinuous dragon resting its head on the shoulder of a handsome, bearded young man dressed in Archontean garb.
	* The ‘table’ on the south wall is just bare stone.
	* The ‘table’ on the west wall is actually the sacrcophagus of Lycandus.
		* Inscription (Mithric) "A Companion of Priscus and Fellow of the Sortian League, Lycandus the Explorer lies here. His delving brought him fame, while his mastery of the Canticle brought him wisdom. Eschewing riches, Lycandus commanded this simple resting place for his earthly bones. "
		* Beneath the lid (open doors): a skeleton (not actually Lycandus) in dusty clothing, with an elaborate platinum pendant in the shape of a knot of platinum wires (400 gp).
		* Secret compartment in south end: hard to detect, a tiny stone button opens.
			* Inscribed (Mithric) on the south end is "Beware! Lycandus is watching", trapped with explosive runes (6d4+6).  (level x 10)% for mages to notice the runes, half that for thieves.
			* Inside is Lycandus' skeleton, with a platinum torc (1,750 gp) with the inscription ‘Sortian’ on it in Mithric, and a gold ring inset with a white pearl (a ring of spider climbing (new), activated by “Lycandus”).  By the skeleton’s side is an intelligent enchanted sword, with a fine troll-skin handle named Scorcher (new). 
	* The central sarcophagus real, but plain, ugly, and undecorated.
		* If Lycandus’s true tomb is opened, the skeleton within will climb from its resting place and lay a curse on the intruders.
			* It choses a target and whispers softly in Mithric to them.  Their STR drops to 3 for 12 Turns.  It follows them (within 30'), and reapplies the curses after it expires.
			* If destroyed, it reassembles after 4d6 Turns (if ground to powder, it takes 4d6 days).  Every 3 days it can teleport to the victim if more than 100 yards away.
			* Dispel magic or Remove curse at 9th level or higher ends the curse skeleton, crumbling it to dust.

### 3-198: Dry Alcove

* The damp river caves and tunnels lead past a dry alcove at this point.
	* The alcove is about 10’ above the floor of the cave and is occupied by two lizardmen.
		* They are badly lost, having somehow navigated a route from SL-4 to 4-159, and thence to 3-212a. They will be willing to do almost anything in return for directions home.
	* An odd symbol (four interlocked circles with a square’s four corners meeting at the centers of the circles) is inscribed on the southwestern wall in dull brown paint.
		* It grants protection from scrying and dampness: any who scramble into the alcove will be effectively invisible to those who pass by in the corridor (and to indirect forms of scrying), and will be dry to boot!

2 bedraggled lizardmen (10% chance): SZ M; AL N; AC 4; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 2+1; HP 13, 10; #AT 1 or 3; Dmg 1-6 (club) and 1-6 (javelin), or 1-2/1-2/1-8. Possessions: clubs;

### 3-199: Mushrooms

* The cave is damp and humid, with stalactites and stalagmites.
	* Between the rock formations are many 3’- to 10’-tall mushrooms, amid which are 3 shriekers (bright blue caps) placed by the fungal foresters of 3-202.

### 3-200: Colossal Crystals

* The entrance to this cavern is 10’ above the floor of the lake.
* Geothermal heat vents make the cave is extremely humid and hot (~120F, ~100% humidity).
	* As a result, it is filled with massive beams of selenite gypsum which crisscross the chamber like pick-up sticks, some are 3’ in diameter and over 25’ long.
	* The giant crystals are easily broken with iron tools, but so soft that they can be scratched by thumbnails.
* Two selenite guardians, whose crystalline speech is unintelligible without magic, confront those clambering among the crystal formations.
	* They politely demand the departure of the intruders from their ‘garden’; if ignored (or not understood), they attack.
	* The difficult terrain and hot and humid environment, gives -2 to all combat rolls while in the cave.

2 selenite guardians (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 2; MV 30’ on dirt, 60’ on selenite; HD 6; HP 41, 37, 36; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/2-8. Special defenses: regenerate 2 HP/round near selenite; immune to fire and water; take only 1 HP from edged weapons.
* The bodies of a slain selenite guardian yields selenite crystals worth 6-600 gp.

### 3-201: Humid Mushroom Cave

* This large cave is extremely humid and warm (although not as hot as 3-200), and smells strongly of minerals. It is filled with medium-sized giant mushrooms (3’-7’ tall). 
* The tunnel northwest leads down a flight of roughly hewn stairs to a slightly wider area, lit by a faint blue light.
	* The light is emitted by a wizard’s staff of blue light stuck into the sand (new).
		* Although useful, there is no way to stop the emission of the blue light (30’ radius), short of covering the staff entirely.

### 3-202: Fungal Foresters

* This cave is warm and moist (though not as much as 3-200 or 3-201).
	* A layer of river silt has made it a natural place a large colony of giant mushrooms.
	* A small colony of 12 fungal foresters makes its home here.
		* The foresters placed the shriekers in 3-199, and move to investigate if the shriekers begin to shriek.
	* A pair of dead adventurers moulder in the eastern protrusion.
		* Long sword, rusty chainmail, shield +1, a set of gold-embellished silverware (26 pieces, 340 gp total), a few folios of parchment entitled "Description of the Inn of the Lost" (books).

### 3-206: Beach and Plinth

* A black sand beach stretches along the north bank of this utterly dark cavern.

	* If their mistress is present, the scrags (3-205) lurk near the beach, ready to aid her.
	* If encountered on the beach, she tries to pretend to be a frail, crazy but harmless old hermit, and asks visitors to help her retrieve her staff from the pool.
		* If they comply, the scrags rise to the attack and she shows her true colors.

Statue of Nertet-Indra
* If the pieces are reassembled, they will form a statue of Nertet-Indra, high priestess of Thoth, standing 10' tall, with arms folded across her chest holding ankhs and a tall cylindrical hat.

		* They will pursue enemies within the river caves.
	* At the bottom of the pool is a silver necklace decorated with dangling azurite (450 gp), and a bone scroll casing (scroll of protection from magic).

3 mud people (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; AC 4; MV 90’; HD 3; HP 22, 18, 15; #AT 2; Dmg 1-8/1-8. Special attacks: hurl mud blobs; drown foes in mud. Special defenses: regenerate 2 HP/rd while touching mud; half damage from edged weapons, and from fire and electricity.

### 3-209: Pillared Caves

* Both lobes of this cavern contain an onyx column atop a stone pedestal, each pedestal with an obvious front, on which is carved a question mark.
	* The columns are composed of five 2’-thick sections mounted on top of each other on an iron rod stuck into the pedestalm each with fives faces that can be rotated independently.  Each section's faces show a distinct carving: a winged horse (pegasus), a ram, an iguana, a snake and a cat.
* The correct combination is to turn the faces, from top to bottom, toward the question mark in the order Pegasus-Ram-Iguana-Snake-Cat (i.e. PRISC, short for Priscus).
	* If done on one column, a voice rumbles (Mithric) “Priscus Pulcher offers his friends the gift of Perception”, and detect illusion is cast on all within 10’ (2d6 hours).
	* If done on both columns, in addition the columns will bestow a +2 to the next 5 rolls of each person within 10 feet.
	* These effects can only be produced once per week.
	* GM Note: the purpose of this puzzle was to provide the enlightened assistance in penetrating the illusionary wall in 3-196.

### 3-210: Lichen Cave

* This large cave is relatively flat, with no stalactites or stalagmites.
	* It is infested with a colony of benign light-green lichen that gives off a soft glow.
		* Edible and nutritious, but not very appetizing.

## Level 3: 211 - 231

### 3-211: Crossroads

* This set of tunnels is damp and warm.
	* The passage to the west has collapsed.
	* The passage to the east is quite narrow at its opening (only 2’ wide).
	* The passage to the south becomes a worked corridor after a short distance, before ending in a locked door to 3-195.

### 3-212: Half-Finished Cave

* This area contains another section of never-completed Thothian construction.
	* The room has been squared and smoothed, and four 3’-deep and 2’-diameter holes have been excavated.  The purpose of the holes, and the room, is unclear.
	* Signs of traffic are evident leading between the west and south doors.
	* Both doors are locked, and well oiled.

##### 3-212a: Stairs Down to 4-159 

* This narrow stair leads downward to 4-159. 

### 3-213: Black Light Zombies

* This cavern slopes downward to the west and is noticeably colder than the surrounding chambers.
	* A 3’-tall rock-crystal lamp (a black light of useful necromancy, new) stands in the middle of the room, emitting strange black light.
		* In this light, undead regenerate 2 hp/round.
		* The lamp has 5 hp and ceases to shine if broken.
	* An ancient Thothian labor force of 12 zombies that was excavating 3-212 stands idle.
		* They attack anyone not wearing the ceremonial robes of Thoth, but will not leave the chamber.
		* They are armed with picks, hammers, and similar implements.

12 zombies: SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 14, 14 12(x3), 11(x3), 10, 10, 9, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special: always strike last; regenerate while in the black light.

### 3-214: Rope Trick

* A rope dangles from mid-air in the middle of this non-descript cave.
	* It is a rope trick rope. Pulling the rope pulls three adventurers from the extra-dimensional space, surprised and ill-disposed (-15% reaction).

GM Note: Roscoe and his friends fell into trouble in the Forum of Set when they inadvertently insulted the Master of the Guild of Service and couldn’t pay the necessary fine.
* Although they lost two members of the party, the remainder got lucky and managed to flee down the Long Stair (4-19) to 4-163, then east to 4-159 and finally to this cave.
* They have good knowledge about Level 4, particularly the direct route from 4-190 through 4-120 and on to the Forum, and, of course, their escape route.
* Their former comrade, Azgallatu, was taken by the setites and is imprisoned in 3-105.

Roscoe, 3rd-level male Thorcin fighter: SZ M; AL LN; AC 5; MV 60’; HD 3; HP 27; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (short bow and arrows), 2-7 (short sword, short bow and +1 arrows). Abilities: STR 17, INT 9, WIS 12, DEX 10, CON 16, CHA 11.

### 3-215: Skeletal Corpses

* This partly finished cave has a rough stone floor, walls, and a crude stone door on the south wall.
	* In the center a solid-gold, 3' tall statuette sits on a greasy crocodile-hide mat.
		* The icon depicts a cat sitting on its hind legs, solid gold with small jet gems for eyes and nose
		* It is a statuette of Bastet (new).
			* Touching (non-Mi'it) it causes a spirit cat to rake you for 2d4 and save vs poison at +2 or die, 3d8 on success.
			* Being near one begins hearing telepathic cat noises; listen long enough and they speak “Avenge this wrong. Return me to my sister-people. Touching me is forbidden!.”  Returning it to the shrine of Bastet (8-38) brings a reward.
	* Around the statuette, and partly on the mat, are four badly decomposed corpses - 3 adventurers and a cave skink.
		* The adventurers have no equipment, as the hag and her minions stole all of it. 
		* The corpses are mostly decomposed, but close examination of the face of one reveals it was raked, as if by sharp claws.
			* The human corpses are of adventurers who stole the statuette and brought it here to examine.  When they touched their prize it inflicted serious - and poisonous - scratches on their faces and bodies.
		* The cave skink had the misfortune to brush against the statuette.

### 3-216: Penned Pudding

* The entrance to this lobed cavern is blocked by a buzzing force field of magical energy.
	* Ancient Thothian mages erected the wall of force to pen a particularly large black pudding for future use and/or study.
		* It is beginning to fray, and collapses if struck hard (such as an open doors check, or a mace blow).
	* If the field is removed, the pudding flows swiftly along the ceiling to drop down on an advancing party.
	* The cavern is unremarkable, except being noticeably free of dust and dirt.

1 black pudding: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 60’; HD 10; HP 50; #AT 1; Dmg 3-24. Special attacks: dissolve wood and metal. Special defenses: divide into parts when struck; immune to cold.

X / 50
### 3-217: The Seamly Run

* In this section, the Seamly Run wends its way through a narrow (5’-wide) but deep (10’-deep) channel.
	* The current is swift.  Those who fall in are borne quickly to the beach at 3-206, taking 1d6 HP from buffeting along the way.

### 3-218: River Cave

* This damp and humid cave holds a shallow puddle along the south wall, occasionally refreshed by seepage from the Seamly Run.
	* Twenty voracious cave skinks live here (only 5-10 present at any given time).
	* They are able to run along walls and like to ‘fish’ in the Seamly Run.
	* They fear the scrags (3-206) and likely flee to the river if noise emerges from the direction of 3-219 or 3-220.  Within 5 rounds, hunger conquers fear, and they return in search of nourishment.

5-10 cave skinks (see new monsters): SZ S; AL N; AC 7; MV 120’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 13, 12(x3), 11, 11, 10; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: toxic mucus.

### 3-219: Warning Sign

* This river cave marks the western edge of the territory of Androsia, the Hag.
	* A femur thrust into a hole in the uneven floor marks the boundary; on top of the femur is a beastman skull.
	* A variety of small animal bones (salamanders, mostly) litters the cave. 

### 3-220: Unfinished Hall

* The priests of Thoth began to work this chamber, but abandoned it before completion.
	* Sections of smooth, rectilinear wall adjoin rough, natural cavern walls.
	* A pair of wooden wheelbarrows stands in the mouth of the east-leading corridor; they contain some dusty mining tools (hammers, picks, pitons, etc.).
	* The rest of the hall is dusty, with clear footprints in the dust (scrag prints) leading towards 3-219.
	* The remains of two adventurers (killed by scrags) lie against the southwestern wall.
		* Short sword +2, a sapphire Sortian eye; a purse (57 sp, 43 gp)
		* A parchment with (Archontean) “red-black-yellow-blue-green-white” (the ‘address’ to the teleportation ring at SL6-28)
		* A map of the eastern precincts of Thoth (3-43 to 3-51, including 3-50, 3-50a and 3-50b).

##### 3-220a: Blocked Corridor

* The corridor to the east is blocked with rubble.
	* An old, brittle skeleton clad in orange Thothian robes lies on the floor of the unfinished corridor that leads to the north.

### 3-221: Gaunt Beastmen

* A moist and dank cave, covered with a strange blue mold.
	* A patrol of beastmen from the Long Range Cavern Patrol (3-154) dwells here, charmed by the greenhag (3-204).
		* They have lost their discipline and are slowly starving to death, subsisting barely on the blue mold.
		* Only Histar, their sergeant, retains a dim sense of his former life and purpose.
		* They have a campfire, but little fuel for it.
		* 15% chance the beastmen are out at 3-222.
		* If the hag is killed, 75% likely the beastmen have fled back to the Tagma.
		* Trisko the Natty of the LRCP is eager for news of his missing patrol.
	* The upper thighs / lower torso portion of the statue of Nertet-Indra (3-206) is discarded in the corner.

### 3-222: Cave of Bones

* This large cave has a 15’ ceiling and is covered with a 2’-deep carpet of bones.
	* The bones are of varied size and origin; some quite ancient, others fresh.
	* Androsia the hag (3-204) and her entourage have deposited centuries worth of bodies in this cave.

### 3-223: Emaciated Ogres

* A small group of ogres, charmed by Androsia the greenhag (3-204), inhabits this extended cavern.
	* Explorers may (2 in 6) notice the odor of smoked meat 10’ into the cave; the odor is automatically noticeable after 30’.
	* The ogres have rigged a deadfall trap (marked X) in the first portion of their cave
		* A skeleton wearing a fine pair of maroon leather boots (25 gp) lies beneath the deadfall as bait.
		* Slighly disturbing it trigger 50% of the time, more serious manipulating 80%.
		* Rocks fall for 2d6 and save vs transform or pinned.
		* At the clatter, the ogres rush ravenously from the eastern cave.
	* The ogres’ actual lair lies east, where a feeble fire burns in a pile of bones.
		* They are curing a human corpse, suspended from a hook directly over the fire. 
		* They have a sack in which they keep their pitiful treasure.
			* 451 cp, four 100 gp aquamarines, 2 pieces of valueless colored glass, and an iron necklace (10 cp).
		* Lying among the carnage is the stone head of the statue of Nertet-Indra (3-206).
			* The head is of a human female wearing a tall cylindrical hat. Her eyes are almond, but hollow.
* 15% chance the ogres are present w/ Androsia in 3-222.
	* If the hag is killed, the ogres will likely (70%) have fled, taking with them their sack (but leaving the stone head and the leather boots).

6 emaciated ogres: SZ L; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 4+1; HP 27, 25, 22, 19, 18, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-10, or by weapon.

	* A quasi-palpable aura of evil may be detected here, just as in 3-222.
	* A 6’ iron rod has been thrust into the middle of the cave floor; the body of an ogre impaled upon it (despite decomposition, it was clearly badly malnourished).
		* Androsia the hag (3-204) placed it here as a warning to both to her slaves and to intruders.

### 3-225: Dead Cube 

* A dead gelatinous cube is slowly deliquescing on the floor of this flat cave. A pack of giant rats is feasting on the tasty remains.
	* In its mass: 63 cp, a single bracer from a pair of bracers of haste (new).
		* The bracer is inoperable without its companion, worn by Killik the goblin (5-46).

15 giant rats: SZ S; AL N(E); AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4(x4), 3(x4), 2(x4), 1(x3); #At 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: 5% chance of disease.

### 3-226: Empty Cave

	* A group of 5 subterranean lizards make their lair in this small cave, in a nest built of sticks, dung, and dirt.
		* Only one lizard is present at any one time.
			* Noisy combat here will draw two more from 3-229 in 3 rounds.

### 3-230: The Seamly Run 

* The Seamly Run is a swift-flowing river that runs through this level.
	* It is filled with cold, clear water.
	* The current between 3-205 and 3-164 is quite strong.

### 3-231: Swift Current and River Exit

* Here the river exits the great cavern through a 7’-diameter tunnel.
	* The current entering the tunnel is quite strong; swimmers anywhere near the tunnel mouth roll 3d8 under DEX or STR to avoid being swept into the tunnel.
		* The river’s exit from level 3 is a relatively narrow crack in the granite; persons stuck in the tunnel will drown in 1d3 rounds unless rescued.
		* A staff of the frog (new) is wedged in the crack.
