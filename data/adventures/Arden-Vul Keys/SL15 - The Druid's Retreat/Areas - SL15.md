## Overview

A set of wide-ranging natural tunnels threads through the stone and earth to the northwest of the ruined city of Arden Vul. 

Although the tunnels were begun by burrowing creatures in the distant past, many of the tunnels were expanded and widened by a band of corrupt legionaries during the final years of the Archontean presence in the city of Arden Vul. This group of criminals (see SL15-4) took the opportunity provided by the War of the Sortians and Theosophs to abscond with a number of valuables from the city. Operating out of the donjon of Arden Vul, they siphoned the stolen goods into the tunnels they located beneath the Ghost Tower (AV-27), and slowly moved the goods north and west, periodically storing them in caves along the way (e.g. SL15-20). The criminals managed to ‘liberate’ a fair number of valuables, but their rear guard fell prey to a periapt of discord (see new magic items) and turned on and slew each other (SL15-20). Some of their valuables are still to be found among the tunnels.

More recently, the druid Gerrilad the Grey (see 2-69), who rules over the baboons on Level 2, discovered the tunnel network, and found it a perfect means by which he could secretly enter and exit the dungeons of Arden Vul in order to collect mistletoe and holly. He periodically ventures from 2-33 to SL15-1, SL15-2, SL15-5, SL15-11, SL15-17, SL15-19, and finally to SL15-21. His druid skills have allowed him to befriend or at least pacify many of the 
animals (e.g. the cave bear in SL15-21) that frequent the tunnels.

The tunnel network also connects to several cellars, sub-basements, crypts, and vaults, some lying within the walls of the ruined city and some without. If a few of these basements are relatively innocuous (e.g., SL15-17), others contain formidable guardians and tempting treasure (e.g., SL15-7 and SL15-13). Finally, it should be noted that the longest-lived inhabitant of the tunnels is the nymph, Phryne, who inhabits the crystalline grotto at SL15-16. Phryne is bored and would like companionship; unfortunately, she is currently engaged in a fierce conflict with a marid named Asim.

General Construction Notes
* Archontean areas: SL15-4, SL15-7 to SL15-10, SL15-13, SL15-17. 
	* These are all the basements or sub-cellars of buildings found within the city (or just without).
* Natural tunnels: Unless otherwise indicated, the tunnels are about 8-12’ wide and 9-12’ tall. 

Important NPCs
* Gerrilad the Grey (2-69). Normally found on Level 2, there is a chance to encounter Gerrilad here as a random encounter.
* Phryne the nymph (SL15-16)

Environment
* The natural tunnels are relatively moist and humid. Numerous small insects and rodents may be detected scampering or fluttering just out of sight.

Access and Egress 
* To Ruined City: trap door in SL15-4, leading up to the basement of the Ghost Tower in AV-27
* To Ruined City: trap-door at SL15-9, leading up to AV-44
* To Ruined City: stairs at SL15-10, leading up to AV-45
* To Ruined City: cave at SL15-21, leading to ruined city at AV-46

## Areas

#### SL15-1: Tunnel and Slope up to Level 2 (2-33)

* A scree of collapsed stone and rubble leads sharply upward to a hole in the floor of one of the cult of Thoth’s robing rooms (2-33).
* The tunnel leading to the scree is narrow (5’ wide), low (5’ tall), and dripping with moisture.

#### SL15-2: Deserted Cave

* A large cave with beautiful flowstone forming irregular ledges leading into the northwestern tunnel.
	* Trackers can detect signs of recent human traffic from SL15-5 towards SL15-1.
	* A 4’-tall marble statue of a whippet (200 gp, 240 lbs), and a 5’-tall bronze statue of Ptah (450 gp, 500 lbs) lean against the wall by the tunnel to SL15-3.
		* Both shows signs of moisture and tarnish.
		* In front of them is a rotted wooden crate, with 5 ancient gold solidi in its ruin.
		* Statues and crate were plunder that the corrupt legionaries were smuggling out of the Ghost Tower (AV-27) during the last days of Archontean rule in Arden Vul (see SL15-4 for more information).
		* Gerrilad the Grey (2-69) is uninterested in statuary and has ignored them.

#### SL15-3: Dead End Corridor

* After rising close to 150’, the tunnel ends in a wide gallery, all marked with impressive flowstone.
	* At the end of the gallery are the scorched remains of three elven adventurers.
		* Former comrades of Gerrilad the Grey (2-69), who stripped them of valuables after their deaths.
		* They have memory crystals bonded to the back of their skulls.
	* Secret Door (west): opens by releasing a hidden catch, and then rotating it on a horizontal pin.
		* Trap: three glyphs of warding inscribed on it (26 HP of fire damage).  Speaking ‘fire’ in Mithric allows passage.
		* +1 Listen at the door to hear wordless moaning and cries (the vengeful spirit in SL15-4).

#### SL15-4: Haunted Sub-Basement (w/ access to AV-27)

* A 40’-diameter sub-basement with a 7' ceiling, packed with crates and barrels.
	* Most of the cargo are spoiled foodstuffs.
		* The clutter and cramped conditions gives -2 attack and damage.
		* Searching (2-4 Turns) turns up quantities of thread, twine, copper wire (5 gp), twenty 5-lb iron ingots (5 cp each), twenty 5-lb steel ingots (5 sp each), a 12 bulls-eye lanterns, 2 dozen wax candles, 2 coils of silk rope, 3 cords of firewood, and a set of surveyor’s tools.
	* A 10’-square trap door leads up to the basement of the Ghost Tower in the donjon of Arden Vul (AV-27).
	* Two ancient corpses lie in a 5’-diameter cleared space near the east side.
		* These were two Archontean military officials (dekarchs), each with a dagger of venom (3 doses remaining in each) in their neck.
		* The souls of the murdered dekarchs haunt the sub-basement and the rest of the Ghost Tower as vengeful spirits.
			* One spirit is always here; the other is 90% likely to be wandering the Ghost Tower.  Each round of combat in the sub-basement has a 20% chance to attract the wanderer.  They will pursue as far as SL15-2.
			* In the final days of Arden Vul, while investigating some of their men smuggling imperial supplies out through the tunnels, they were lured here and murdered.
			* Enraged by the foul betrayal, until their remains are given a proper burial, they continue to reform (in 1d6 hours), even if defeated.
	* Secret Door (east): undo a hidden catch and the door rotates on a horizontal pivot.

Poulos Tissel and Mekos Gadril, vengeful spirits (see new monsters): SZ M; AL LE; AC 1; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 41, 36; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: STR drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire; turned as vampires; reform in 1-6 hours so long as their bones remain unburied.

#### SL15-5: Covered Pit Traps

* At this wide space in the corridor, Gerrilad the Grey (2-69) constructed a pair of pit traps that almost completely block the tunnel. 
	* Traps (covered pits): 15’x15’, 15' deep (1d8+1), covered with canvas painted to resemble stone with rock dust and sand sprinkled on top.
		* They cover the entire passage except a 3’-wide ledge along the northeast wall.
		* The pits are next to each other; leaping across one drops you in the other.

#### SL15-6: Rat Nest

* A swarm of giant rats nests in this isolated nook.
	* There are a total of 40 rats in the swarm, with 24 present at a time who fiercely defend the nest.
	* Within the nest: 37 ancient silver pennies, 3 zircon gems (50 gp each), a plotion of cloud giant strength

24 giant rats: SZ S; AL N(E); AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4(x6), 3(x6), 2(x6), 1(x6); #At 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: 5% chance of disease.

#### SL15-7: Lost Vaults of the Sodality of Plenty 

* A narrow crack (2’ wide, 4’ tall) leads from the tunnel into a large vault (100’x50’x15’)
	* At the west end is a 10’-wide staircase that once led up to the basement of the Sodality’s base, now covered in tons of rubble.
	* A 10’-wide corridor runs between two rows of nine stone storage cubes, each 10’ x 20' x 10', and accessed via a locked stone door.
		* Twelve of the vaults are open and unlocked, their contents removed before the fall of the city.
		* The other six are still locked, and some are trapped.
	* The Sodality’s ancient vault guardian – an insane clay golem – remains vigilant.
* The Sodality of Plenty was one of the early merchant guilds-cum-banks, serving wealthy Archonteans across the empire, and was the precursor to the Golden Band.
	* There is a 50% chance the modern Golden Band still has a record of any recognizable items found here; attempts to sell that item might bring enmity and/or legal action from the Golden Band.

	* 3 are always present, whlie the rest are a wandering encounter.
	* A stone staircase in the southwest corner once ascended to a residence above, now completely destroyed.  Tons of rubble block the exit.
		* It would take several days of serious digging to render the stairs usable again.
	* Several large pieces of art and treasure were stashed here by the ring of corrupt ancient legionaries (see SL15-4).  The ogre homunculi use them as trappings for pretending to be goblin-kings in their own little court.

#### SL15-9: Sub-Basement of Westgate (w/ access to AV-44)

* This sub-basement is filled with debris, mostly crates and barrels smashed open, with  their contents dispersed.
	* Holes in the walls were made by picks and sledges; the north hole from outside, the south hole from within the sub-basement. 
	* Every turn spent searching the debris, has a cumulative 10% chance of attracting the minotaurs from SL15-8.
	* Trap Door (ceiling, stuck): leads up to the lowest floor of the Westgate gatehouse (AV-44). Forcing open the trap door requires a successful open doors roll.

#### SL15-10: Basement with Bones and Lizards (w/ access to AV-45)

* The tunnel from the north narrows to only 3’ wide and 4’ tall just before climbing steeply to a hole in the stone floor of the basement residential cells of an ancient gladiatorial school (AV-45) located outside the city walls of Arden Vul.
	* The cell level is structurally intact, with thirty-five 8’x8’ cells, plus a common area and some storerooms.
	* It smells foully of animals, and is covered with the bones of small- and medium-sized prey. It is the lair of five subterranean lizards, three present at any time.
	* * The owner concealed a stash behind a pair of loose bricks in the basement wall (detect as concealed door).
		* 6,161 gp; a gold collar set with garnets (6,000 gp); a platinum necklace with depending emeralds (9,000 gp); a pair of matching platinum and emerald earrings (4,000 gp); and a silver brooch set with topaz (5,000 gp).

#### SL15-11: Crossroads

* Several tunnels converge in this broad cave.
	* Gerrilad the Grey (2-69) painted 3’-tall red Archontean letters next to each of the tunnel mouths.  In a clockwise direction: ‘E’ (north tunnel), ‘W’ (southeast tunnel) and ‘N’ (southwest tunnel).
		* These stand for ‘Exit’, ‘Workplace’, and ‘No’ respectively, which he knew could deceive potential intruders about cardinal directions.
	* Being centrally located, check for random encounters every turn here.

#### SL15-12: Tunnel Descending to Level 8 (8-60)

* This tunnel descends for over half a mile, becoming progressively drier in the process, before joining 8-60.

#### SL15-13: Crypt of the Everlasting Brotherhood

* A crack in the east wall, 2’ wide by 5’ high (widened by a curious minotaur from SL15-8), leads to a hidden crypt.
* This large space (100’x100’x20’) is filled with granite sarcophagi (359 total) pushed so close together that it is almost impossible to move between them.
	* A relief of a great taloned hand is carved upon the wall at intervals.
	* The sarcophagi are fairly plain, rough-hewn from granite. 20% (70 of the total) have lids carved as gisants, with images of the inhabitant and (sometimes) a short inscription (Mithric) of an Archontean name, with the word ‘Brother’ after it. 
		* There are 349 sarcophagi total.  175 hold inert mummies.  The remaining 174 hold undead (80 ghouls, 62 wights, 28 shadows, 4 mummies).
	* Scattered among the sarcophagi are ten mausoleums of white marble, each measuring 10’x6’x10’.
		* Formed in the style of a classical temple (with pediment, hip roof, etc.), inscribed with the occupant's name, with a narrow door (3’ wide) leading to a raised table on which lie the remains of the inhabitant.
	* A staircase on the south wall once led up to the basement of the Brotherhood’s extramural headquarters.  They have collapsed and are inaccessible.
* The Everlasting Brotherhood:
	* An ancient Archontean cult of wealthy followers of the proscribed death god, Mordiggian. Its members sought eternity through unlife, and committed themselves and their fortunes to the pursuit of these goals.  Over the centuries, the crypt in which brothers were interred grew in size, reaching its current state in the last decades before the Archontean collapse.
* Disturbing the Brotherhood
	* The Brotherhood rests peacefully (even the undead) until their sarcophagus / mausoleum is disturbed. Opening random sarcophagi is relatively safe; no other undead will wake.
	* Each mausoleums opened has a 10% cumulative chance of causing the undead inhabitants of the remaining mausoleums to wake and step forth. 
		* Once any mummy has awakened, all remaining undead within mausoleums rise.
	* Once combat with Pannius the Discordant has begun, all the undead from mausoleums and sarcophagi begin to rise to assist their master
		* Each round there is a 50% chance for 1-2 ghouls and a 25% chance for a wight to throw off the lids of their sarcophagi to aid Pannius.

		* Expansion Possibilities: The secret cultic area might lead to additional ritual chambers and a shrine to Thanatos; it should contain additional undead and information about the cult of Mordiggian. It might also lead to a sub-level that eventually connects to a main dungeon level.

#### SL15-16: Crystalline Grotto 

* A broad lake surrounded by a lichen-encrusted shelf occupies the heart of this huge, 70’ tall cave.
	* The lichen emits a low green phosphorescence, amplified by the crystals that stud the walls, softly lighting the entire grotto in a green glow.
	* The lake holds numerous pale white crayfish, blind white cave perch, and strands of whitish lake-weed.
	* In the center of the lake is an island about 50’ in diameter.
		* A slender, marble circular staircase leads to a hole in the ceiling of the cave.  The last 20’ are smashed, and the hole is clogged with debris.
		* A 50’-tall, white-barked tree grows in the exact center of the island.
			* Scores of small cave crickets perch in the tree branches, emitting a beautiful and harmonious chirping. 
			* Buried among the roots of the silverwood tree (Phryne's stash): 10 pieces of jewelry (5 worth 500 gp each, 4 worth 5,000 gp each, and 1 worth 10,000 gp); the ewer of Fadil the Clear; 3 cones of incense of attraction; a black glass activation square; and a potion of extra healing.
	* 3 jannee (turbaned men in exotic chain mail) have their backs to the tree, brandishing scimitars towards a towering, 18’-tall marid floating above the lake.
		* Asim, the marid, is shouting at they (Marid): “Submit to your proper master! Do not shelter the thief! Make her come forth, and deliver to me the ewer!”
* There is a standoff between Phryne the nymph and the angry marid, Asim.
	* Phryne is hiding within the magical silverwood tree (using her plant door spell), while Asim bellows and threatens.
	* She summoned three jannee to defend her, using a rare magic item called the ewer of Fadil the Clear.
	* The summoned jannee are unhappy at having to defend her against a powerful marid, but are compelled by the magic to do so.

Possible PC Actions:
* If Asim is attacked, he defends himself vigorously. The jannee shout angrily (“Don’t anger him!”), but won’t intervene. Asim likely torments the party for 4-6 rounds before retreating to the Astral Plane, threatening death and misfortune on all.
* The jannee defend themselves if attacked, calling for the party to cease their foolishness, Asim shouts encouragement, happy to have his goals accomplished without dirtying his own hands. Asim shouts to "look for the wretched faery" and to "bring me the ewer!"
* Asim is arrogant, haughty, and entirely egotistical. If suitably humble and flattering, he deigns to hear the party's requests. He offers great riches (10,000 gp) to each PC, if they bring him the ewer of Fadil the Clear. If needed, he sweetens the deal by promising them a wish (to be fulfilled by an efreeti who owes Asim a gambling debt).
	* If the PCs agree but renege, Asim attacks for 4-6 rounds before departing, promising dire punishments to the PCs ‘and all their offspring’.
	* If the PCs fulfill the bargain, Asim provides the wealth (and the wish) within a week, at whatever place the PCs have specified.
* Negotiating with the Jannee: The jannee are clearly uncomfortable, and beg the PCs to seek a solution between “Lady Phryne” and the “great lord Asim”. They are cagey about who/where Phryne is, telling the party to ‘talk to the tree.’ Whining that they possess no authority, and are merely ‘caught between the wind and the rain’, they beseech the PCs to end the conflict. If attacked, they defend themselves.
* Negotiating with Phryne, or ‘the tree’: may not be obvious they are talking to a nymph, even as the ‘tree’ responds. Phryne claims to be a helpless creature who has never hurt anyone, one who is being bullied by the ‘mean genie’. She urges PCs not to trust the ‘honeyed words and dire threats’ of the genie (Asim), as he is merely a thief trying to drive her from her grotto. If they will slay or drive off Asim, she offers her love and friendship, her wisdom, and a ‘few baubles’ from her meager stores. If accomplished, Phryne will forever aid the PCs with spells and information about the Archontean period of Arden Vul (she had many lovers during this time); she also provides each PC with a valuable piece of jewelry (5,000 gp each).
* If the tree is attacked, it is AC 4, HP 120, with no attacks; the tree ‘bleeds’ a white sap. Attacks upon it cause the crickets to commence a dirge-like chirping, and the luminescent lichen to flash in a strobe-like way.
	* Phryne only emerges from the tree when it is close to being destroyed, using her ring of change self to appear as beautiful and pitiful (but not instantly blinding those who view her). She pleads for mercy for one round. If unsuccessful, she drops the illusory form and stands naked, hoping to slay her persecutors.
	* If the PCs successfully resist and/or won’t negotiate, she reluctantly offers the ewer to ‘tree cutters’ and urges them to depart and never return; she will never aid the PCs in the future.
* If Asim is driven away without the PCs attacking her tree, Phryne emerges from the tree in her illusory form (using her ring) and converses happily with her saviors (although she might still attempt to charm any males with CHA 17-18).

Phryne the Nymph (pron. ‘Fry-knee’)
* One of the handmaidens of Isis, dwellers in the Land of Reeds.
* Ancient and very wise. With newcomers, she adopts a coy, girlish demeanor, one that suggests less wisdom and experience.
* She is bound to the crystal grotto, and derives her life force from the grotto; only when the tree is felled will she be truly destroyed.
* She is rather bored, as companionship over the last twelve centuries has been limited.  She has been summoning jannee for conversation and companionship. Thus she is rather talkative, and makes every effort (including potentially charm attractive people) to encourage the party to stay and keep her company.
* Anxious for news of the outside world, and happy to trade her ancient historical knowledge. She’d like nothing more to brew herbal tea for new friends, provided those friends were willing to stay with her for ... well, for a while.
* Her ring of change self lets her disguise herself to prevent blindness.

Asim the Marid
* Asim is formidable, maybe too powerful for most parties to defeat. If angered, he makes full use of his magical powers (including manipulating the water in Phryne’s lake).
* He is arrogant and considers the PCs nothing but flies, not invested in killing them.  He departs after promising to make them pay, perhaps becoming a recurring foe.
* If the party aid Asim (defeating the jannee, felling the tree or otherwise forcing Phryne to surrender the ewer), he fulfills his obligations and guarantees the party a friendly reception if they ever visit the court of the Padisha on the elemental plane of water.

GM Note
* The corrupt legionaries (SL15-4 and SL15-18) stole the fabled ewer of Fadil the Clear from an imperial wizard just before the collapse of Archontean rule (1,200 years ago).
* They encountered Phryne in these tunnels and were instantly besotted, offering her the ewer as a gift.
* Over the years Phryne has periodically used it to summon jannee to provide her with companionship.
* After the last jann was released from its century of service, he complained to his master, Asim the marid, who decided to track down and remove the cup from ‘frivolous hands’.
