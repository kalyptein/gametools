## Overview

Looming over the Plaza of Thoth (AV-7) in the ruined city of Arden Vul, the Tower of Scrutiny is a formidable, squat symbol of Archontean power, one rendered all the more impressive for standing intact among the surrounding rubble.

The Tower of Scrutiny once served as the above-ground headquarters of the Over-Seer of Thoth. Its defining feature was the great, swiveling ibis head that occupied the top floor of the tower and allowed the Over-Seer to scrutinize the surrounding plaza and buildings. 

Due to its close connection with Thoth, the Tower survived the destruction of the city. And yet it is currently a place of great evil, ruled by the master wraith Loukios Tornikion (TS-16) and its lesser servants.

Should Loukios be defeated, however, the Tower would offer a new and easy access route from the ruined city to a central location in the precincts of Thoth in Sub-Level 3.

The Tower is 40’ square and composed of heavy granite blocks. Rising 45’ into the sky, it is comprised of four levels above ground and one below. Although roofed, the top floor is punctuated with a series of broad windows; the rest of the tower is windowless. A set of locked and wizard locked (12th level) double doors lead to the ground floor from the surrounding plaza.

Access and Egress
* To the Ruined City: double doors at TS-1, leading to ruined city
* To the Ruined City: secret door at TS-6, leading to ruined city
* To Sub-Level 3: stairs at TS-19, leading down to SL3-5A
* Gate Destinations
	* TS-12: gate from SL6-17A (Tower of Pol)
 
Random Encounters
* There are no random encounters within the Tower of Scrutiny.
* But there are lots of wraiths waiting to notice intruders.

## TS 1 - 6 (Ground Floor)
### TS-1: Carved Bronze Doors

 * A pair of 8' tall, massive bronze doors open to the Forum carved with symbols of Thoth: ibises, baboons, moons, magical glyphs, and multiple iterations of the Archontean alphabet.
	* They are locked and wizard locked (12th level, see TS-1).
		* Keys are in TS-16 and SL5-2 (they don't bypass the wizard lock).
	* Touching the letters to spell any secret name of Thoth causes the doors to glide open noiselessly, opening both ward and lock.
		* The names, e.g., “Thrice Great”) obtainable from the books "Thoth in All His Forms" or "Secreta Secretorum".
	* They close after a turn, regardless of how they were opened.
	* They require the same means to open from inside as well as out.

### TS-2: Viewing Platform

* A trapezoidal platform juts into a darkened open space (the well of wraiths, TS-3) which extends upwards and downwards.
	* Every round on the platform, +10% (cumulative) chance of attracting wraiths from the well.
		* Once one wraith has notice intruders, another joins the fray each round until all are engaged or slain (see TS-3).

	* The top 10’ of the well is cloaked by a continual darkness spell.
*  The well is haunted by twenty-two wraiths.
	* They are drawn to living beings who enter the tower, with greatest risk on the viewing platform (TS-2) and open walkways around the well on each floor.
	* They cannot pass through doors or walls, due to the wards, and only enter the top floor (TS-12) during the night.
	* They have free access to areas TS-17 and TS-20.

		* Includes a coil of elven rope (new), a bulls-eye lantern, and three flasks of oil.

### TS-5: Robing Chamber

* Both doors are locked.
* The walls are lined with wooden pegs, hanging 15 ruined sets of ceremonial robes from the cult of Thoth.
	* One set is made of silk and has survived intact: it is bright orange, with blue embroidery depicting ibises, baboons, and the fourth secret name of Thoth (the Light of Comprehension, see Secreta Secretorum in Arden Vul books).

## TS 7 - 8 (2nd Floor)

### TS-7: Mask Storage

### TS-8: Spiral Stairs, 2nd floor

* This stone spiral staircase, steps worn and smooth, runs the length of the tower, from the basement to the third floor.
* Second floor
	* Lying on the stairs here are the remains of two dead adventurers and one of the original priest-administrators of the Tower.

		* Administrator (in shoe): a letter folded into a paper airplane (Mithric)
			* “The Second Over-Seer has gone mad. He has locked the door and prevented us from leaving to join the retreat of our comrades. We hear him chanting strange litanies within his chamber; they are NOT the Litany of Light. In fact, he has seemed increasingly unhinged the past several weeks. Just this morning an enormous thunderclap was heard from his office, and then silence. I am begging whoever finds this missive to plead with the archon to force the doors of the tower and rescue us, his loyal servants!”
	* Southern door is spiked shut from the inside, impossible to open from the well.
	* Eastern door: closed but easy to open; once opened, active steps are required or it will always swing slowly open (jury rigged latch, spikes), allowing access to the wraiths.

GM Note: the parchment is a clue about the fate of Loukios Tornikion (TS-16) and the Tower. The thunderclap was Thoth striking Loukios dead for his betrayal. Sadly for this priest, Loukios rose as a master wraith and slew his former underling before the priest could jettison his desperate note from the top of the tower.

## TS 9 - 11 (3rd Floor)

### TS-9: Looted Office

* Both doors to this chamber have been broken down.
* Within are pitiful remains of an administrative office: a smashed wooden desk and chair, shredded parchment receipts, snapped styluses, and general detritus.
	* Two drained corpses of scribes lie on the floor (victims of the wraiths).

### TS-10: Spiral Stairs, 3rd Floor

* This stone spiral staircase, steps worn and smooth, runs the length of the tower, from the basement to the third floor.
* Third floor: both doors are stuck closed.
	* Scrawled in blood on the inside of the south door is (Archontean) “Do not open the doors below! They are waiting!”

### TS-11: Floating Stairs

* The top 10' of the Well, including the stairs, is cloaked in Continual Darkness to prevent sunlight from entering the tower.
* Wooden staircases leading 10’ from the walkways of the third floor to the stone floor of the Scrutiny of Thoth (TS-12), above the Well (TS-3).
	* Old and rotted (50% chance to collapse under > 50 lb), leading to a drop of 50' to the basement (TS-15).

## TS 12 - 13 (Top Floor)

### TS-12: Scrutiny of Thoth

* The top floor of the tower is open to the outside world via eight 8’-wide windows (+5% to climb the outside walls).
	* The roof is 15’ above; once covered with red tiles, now badly damaged and leaky.
	* The floor is formed of large flagstones.
	* Two narrow staircases lead down, wooden and quite unsafe (TS-11).  Not far down they vanish into Continual Darkness.
* Three recent corpses lie strewn about the area: two former employees from the Sign of the Broken Head (AV-22), and a grimalkin thief.
	* They entered at night and were pursued and drained by the wraiths.
	* Mercs: two sets of splint mail; two short swords; two shields
	* Thief: leather armor +1; a bandolier w/ 7 throwing daggers; a club; a small gold head depicting a barbarian (actually fool’s gold, 35 cp); a scroll of curse item (new); and an ancient letter from Uriel Basileon (Mithric), archon of Arden Vul (AV-29), to Kel Bormol, Overseer of Thoth (SL3-2A).
		* “In answer to the pious inquiry of Kel Bormol, Overseer of Thoth, Uriel Basileon, most humble archon, offers this reply. Your assistant, the Second Overseer, has not dared show himself since of his cowardly retreat before the Sortian onslaught. He cowers within the Tower of Scrutiny, refusing entry to all. Should conditions improve, and should the Sortian dragons depart, I shall smoke him out of his lair, and deliver him to you for punishment. I should warn you, furthermore, that my agents have noticed a messenger from Hithra Paleologos obtaining entrance to the Tower of Scrutiny. I know not what this portends, but it cannot be good. Be warned.”

GM Note: the letter hints at some secrets surrounding the Tower. It notes the rift between Overseer Kel Bormol (SL3-2A) and his chief lieutenant, the Second Overseer, Loukios Tornikion (TS-16). It hints that the imprisonment of Kel Bormol by Hithra Paleologos (cf. 3-36A to 3-36E) was the product of collusion between Loukios and Hithra. The city of Arden Vul was destroyed before the rescript could be delivered; Uriel Basileon’s corpse may be found in AV-29. The letter was recently discovered in the ruins of the archonal palace by the thief, who was then killed by the wraiths.

### TS-13: Ibis Head of Scrutiny

* Central to the top floor is this massive, 8’-tall ibis head.
	* A marvel of craftmanship, composed of a stone core, ivory sheathing for the head and neck, red porphyry for the bill, and circles of polished silver for the eyes.

3 greater guardians of Thoth (new): SZ L; AL LN; AC 0; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 57, 53, 48; #AT 4 or 1; Dmg 1-8/1-8/1-8/1-8 or 1-12; MR 20%. Special attacks: fear, stun. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; teleport without error 2/day.

## TS 14 - 20 (Basement)

### TS-14: Spiral Stairs, Basement

* This stone spiral staircase, steps worn and smooth, runs the length of the tower, from the basement to the third floor.
* Basement: door leading to TS-15 is locked.

### TS-15: Floor of Well of Wraiths

* At its base, the pillar that rises through the entire Well of Wraiths is uncarved.
	* An ibis head apparatus (a smaller version of the ibis head of scrutiny (TS-13)) is attached to the pillar at a point 5.5’ above the floor.
		* One could stand with back to the pillar and head inserted into the apparatus.
		* Doing so allows the user to see out of the ibis head of scrutiny and control it with his thoughts.
		* Useless without the much larger (and impossible-to-move) ibis head of scrutiny, but could be sold as a work of art for 500 gp.

 * Within two rounds, sounds of movement among the remains bring the imperial stone guardian from TS-17, and the master wraith from TS-16.

Wraiths: for stats, see TS-3.

### TS-16: Second Over-Seer’s Office

* The south doors to this area is stuck open, but the east door is spiked shut from within.
* This was the working office and residence of the Second Over-Seer of Thoth, the official responsible for the administration and upkeep of the tower of scrutiny.
	* The southern ell contains 3 desks, 6 wooden chairs, and two scroll cases.
		* In a desk drawer: a bag of silver shavings (10 gp), a periapt of finding (attuned to heqeti, new),a copy of the "Courtship of Julius the Exarch" (see books), and a black and a white glass activation square.
		* Scroll cases: documents on tower supply and maintenance. Valueless, but a close reader might notice the receipts are always for four casks of wine (not five), a hint that the fifth cask contained something other than wine (see TS-20).
			* Among the red tape: 5 cleric scrolls (speak with dead, remove curse, cure serious wounds, true seeing, and holy name (new).
	* The northwest corner contains a small sitting area, with a settee, two arm chairs and a coffee table.
	* The small eastern ell contains an armoire and a simple bed, upon which rests the corpse of the last Second Over-Seer, Loukios Tornikion.
		* On the wall above the bed is scrawled in strangely blackened blood, the terrible blasphemy (Mithric): “May Tsathoggua feast upon the ibis!”
			* Loukios is now a powerful master wraith (new), who dominates all the ordinary wraiths. Within two rounds of hearing sounds from TS-15, Loukios arrives to attack the intruders.
		* The corpse wears a heqeti ring (new) and carries a key ring with keys to all doors in the tower.
			* If the ring is removed, and the remains either blessed or destroyed, Loukios is instantly destroyed.
* All the furniture is finely made and in good condition (30-180 gp per item).

GM Note: rendered chaotic evil and insane by the heqeti ring, Loukios Tornikion became increasingly erratic in the final days of Archontean control in Arden Vul. He ceased communicating with his superior (Kel Bormol, SL3-2A) and the archon (AV-29), and closed the tower to entry.
* Eventually he called upon his new god for power, and Thoth smote and killed him.
* Such was the power of his new evil, however, that he returned as a master wraith, killed the remaining staff of the tower, turning them into wraiths.  For the past 1,200 years he has slowly added to his incorporeal army.

Loukios Tornikion, master wraith (new): SZ M; AL CE; AC 1; MV 150’, 300’ flying (Class B); HD 9+1; HP 63; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: immune to sleep, hold, charm, and cold; silver, or +1 or better weapons to hit; turned as a vampire.

* In the southwest corner of the hallway stands a long forgotten imperial stone guardian.
	* It lurches into action on hearing footsteps in TS-15 and attacks all those who it does not recognize as priests of Thoth.
		* Wearing Thothian robes or masks of Thoth (see TS-7) renders one ‘invisible’ to the stone guardian.
		* The guardian is not activated by the wraiths.
* The door to TS-19 was locked and spiked shut from TS-17 by Loukios Tornikion and his loyalists.

1 imperial stone guardian (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 60; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%.

* Lining the walls are casks and crates that used to supply the tower.
	* Crates of molded foodstuffs occupy the north wall.  There is a musty smell in the air.
		* Poking around in them has a 50% chance per Turn of uncovering yellow mold.
	* The east wall holds five large casks (5’in diameter, by 6’ deep).
