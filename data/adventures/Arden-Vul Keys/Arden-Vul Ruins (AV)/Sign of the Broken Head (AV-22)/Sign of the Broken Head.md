Two enterprising rascals - a Thorcin named Kronos Kettle-Belly and his Archontean lover, Estelle - have established a fortified refuge and trading center just beyond the River Gate (AV-23). 

#### Exterior

* A fortified refuge and trading center just beyond the River Gate (AV-23). 
	* Built on the solid foundation of an old outbuilding from scavenged stone blocks and wood beams.
		* Kronos and his men salvaged the colossal head of Arden the Defender from the ruins of the forum (AV-30) and mounted it on a beam above the front door of the Inn.
			* The head is six feet in diameter, with oval, staring eyes (empty of their insets), and is depicted clad in a Corinthian helmet.
			* The head detects as magic (Estelle knows), but seems inert.  If addressed as “Lord Arden” it will animate and whisper “Restore me! Restore me! Courage shall be yours when I am whole and the incantation sung!”
	* A central structure (30’ x 40’ x 25’) with an attached stable (20’ x 20’ x 12’) projecting southeast.
		* Fort-like, with no windows on the stone ground story, and only a few narrow windows set into the wooden second floor.
		* No interior connection to the stable.
	* Several less-fortified outbuildings nearby: a smokehouse, outhouse, kitchen, and two storehouses.

#### Interior

* A single, smoky common room with a large fireplace and numerous sturdy wooden tables and legs.
	* Lit by the fire and by two continual light spells cast onto pebbles (gifts from some grateful clients).  At precisely 11 PM, Kronos covers the pebbles and the common room is darkened (until 6 AM).
* Upstairs is a large bunkroom and three private rooms.
	* The largest of the three is where Kronos and Estelle sleep
		* Secured inside the bedframe, a tightly wrapped oilcloth packet: 20 ancient octagonal platinum coins, a small silk pouch with 20 amethysts (100 gp each), a scroll of holy name, an emerald necklace (1,475 gp). 
	* The second has been turned into an office and storeroom
		* Inside a keg of ale, in an iron box (poison needle trapped, Kronos has the key): 2,397 sp, 3,024 gp, a potion of plant control
	* The third is kept empty for important visitors.
	* Kronos’s employees sleep in the bunkroom, which has room for 36. Any additional guests sleep on the floor of the Common Room.

##### Rates
* Bunkroom Bed: 10 sp/day, or 3 gp/week
* The Private Room (33% availability): 3 gp/day, or 20 gp/week.
* Food: 2sp for a simple meal, 2 gp for a rich meal.
* Iron Rations: 3x normal price

##### Estelle's Magical Services
* Cure Light Wounds 100 gp
* Detect Magic 150 gp
* Protection from Evil 350 gp
* Augury 300 gp
* Slow Poison 350 gp
* Cure Blindness 1,000 gp
* Cure Disease 1,000 gp
* Dispel Magic 700 gp
* Remove Curse 1,000 gp
* Cure Serious Wounds 350 gp
* Neutralize Poison 1,000 gp

#### Passing Through
##### Traveling Tinkers:
* Kronos encourages traders to add the Broken Head to their regular rounds, so as to be able to provide supplies to adventurers.
* 1d3 traders likely to be present at any time. 
	* Sell adventuring gear at 150% of the list price
	* Each has a hoard of 100-400 gp worth of coins and gems on their person.
	* 10-40% chance that one trader will have something unusual: 1-4 potions of healing, a treasure map, a bit of useful lore relating to the Halls of Arden Vul (equivalent to a good rumor), etc.

##### The Statue Brokers

* Kronos permits three statue brokers from the merchant factors of Newmarketto live at the inn as permanent residents.
	* Crisarius Three-Legs, from the Prosperity Factor
	* Fenitior Stone-Hands, from the Wisdom Factor
	* Godric the Wise, a rare Thorcin member of the Golden Band.
* They convince adventurers to locate and remove statues from Arden Vul.
	* Whichever broker is chosen by the adventurers assigns a value to the statue and issues a letter of credit for that value.
	* The letter may be cashed in on delivery of the statue to the appropriate factor in Newmarket.
	* A broker gets 10% of the valuation, and Kronos gets another 10%.
	* Each month a messenger from Newmarket delivers news and a bag of gems (typically 50 gems worth 50-100 gp each) to each broker, for expenses, bribery, and payment for successful transactions.
* The three brokers appear as bitter enemies when negotiating with adventurers, but are actually close friends. They are also canny evaluators and, while happy to bid against each other, are unlikely to be snookered by adventurers.
	* They typically start with an offer of 50% of the statue's value; expecting to haggle up to 75-80%.  Canny thieves or others appraisers can realize they are being fleeced.
	* If facing skilled negotiators, the brokers quickly fall into line, beginning at 80% of value and hoping to end at no more than 110% of value.
* Kronos likes the money he receives from the brokers, and will protect them vigorously if needed; those threatening the brokers may find themselves ostracized from the Broken Head.

Generic Statue Value (if not already listed)

Tiny 25 gp | Unimportant 25 gp | Poor x2
Small 50 gp | Average 50 gp | Fair x5
Medium 100 gp | Important 100 gp | Good x10
Large 200 gp | Very Important 200 gp | Exceptional x20

#### Kronos’s Illicit Activities

* Despite his friendly and engaging manner, Kronos is an inquisitive, acquisitive, and thoroughly opportunistic person.
	* He is quick to encourage adventurers to tell tales of their exploits and, especially, of the loot they have acquired.
	* He's usually content to fleece adventurers with high prices.
* Flashy displays of wealth, particularly newly acquired from the Halls, may tempt him to more aggressive action (25%).
	* Kronos and his men wait until early morning before surrounding the victims and politely demand the goods.
	* If the party looks too powerful (level 4+), he'll attempt stealth instead.

#### Relationships with Others in the Ruins:

* Craastonistorex (AV-40)
	* Kronos and Estelle are wary of the dragon; they provide him with game on a weekly basis.  Estelle, unknown to Kronos, is providing cure spells and information about Arden Vul in lieu of monetary tribute.
	* If asked about threats in the ruins, they will warn guests about the dragon, and will advise them to treat the wyrm politely, but firmly. If guests grow irritating or hostile, Kronos will attempt to persuade the wyrm to attack the unwanted PCs.
	* Each month there is a 10% cumulative chance that Craastonistorex begins to demand the more traditional cash tribute.
* Tuftwillig (AV-7)
	* No one at the Broken Head is aware of the sentient tree.
* Galeth, Master of the Long House (AV-43)
	* Estelle is aware of a great evil in the Long House, but does not know its nature. She knows of the ghouls that frequently emerge at night, but their master remains unknown.
* Phlebotomas Plumthorn and his halflings (3-2 to 3-6)
	* Kronos and Estelle are aware of the extortion racket set up by the halflings, and are in fact envious of its ingenuity. Out of grudging professional respect, they pretend ignorance of the halflings and their game.  If asked, they suggest these are adventurers.
	* Once a month the halflings trade loot from the halls to Kronos for provisions; a secret known only to Kronos and Estelle.
* The Beastmen (3-138 to 3-162)
	* Kronos and Estelle are neutral with regard to the beastmen. They know the beastmen must have a separate entrance to the Halls (EX-12), but not know where it is, nor have they (yet) attempted to locate it. Since the beastmen have seemed honorable (i.e., lawful), the pair is content to watch them and, on occasion, trade with them.
* The Cult of Set (Level 4, especially 4-1 to 4-61)
	* The inhabitants of the Broken Head know that the entrance to the precincts of Set lies on the cliff face (EX-15). Although they know little specific about the cult, they are generally intimidated by the demeanor of the cultists. Kronos would be highly pleased if the PCs were to quietly eliminate the cultists from the Westgate (AV-44).
* Tower of Scrutiny (AV-8
	* Kronos sent some of his men to investigate the tower; as they never returned, the inhabitants of the Broken Head have developed a healthy fear of the tower.
* Other Threats
	* Kronos and his men will be happy to describe some of the threats which lie in the ruins, including the baboon tower (AV-9), some ‘unknown but deadly creatures’ at the donjon (AV-27), the giant crocodiles and giant snapping turtle (AV-35), and numerous vermin, bears, minor undead, spiders, and snakes. 
* Legend
	* They also have developed a fake ‘ghost story’ which they use to try to impress and intimidate to newcomers; this story involves the ghost of a certain ‘Hurree the Echophont’ who allegedly reacts to loud noises by threats and attacks. Kronos’s men love to develop new tales about Hurree’s depredations. The rascals have based their fake ghost on the name and quirks of a one-time visitor to the inn, one Chaudri the Echophont (currently found at 7-76C, and ignorant of his ‘fame’).

#### Knowledge of the Dungeons

* Kronos and Estelle are an excellent source of rumors concerning the Halls.
	* They can dispense 5 adventuring and 3 historical rumors to newcomers to the Sign.
	* There is a 33% chance that they learn a new rumor each week. 
* In addition to randomly-determined rumors, they can impart the following:
	* Entrances
		* The Pyramid of Thoth (AV-15) is the main entrance, but there are probably some lesser holes on the cliff face that provide access (e.g., EX-11, EX-15). They suspect that some of the cellars in the ruined city also lead down to the dungeons.
	* Levels
		* They are certain that there are ‘at least a dozen’ levels under the pyramid, culminating in a huge cavern with an enormous lake.
	* Inhabitants
		* They know of a tribe of baboons (Level 2), a well-organized unit of beastmen (Level 3), a goblin kingdom (Sub-Level 4), and a tribe of ‘advanced’ lizardmen (SL5). They have heard of the existence of a band of intelligent “trolls” (the varumani of Level 7). 
	* Iconic Locations
		* They can provide the usual information about:
			* The Pyramid of Thoth
			* The Court of the Goblin King
			* The Great Chasm
			* The Obsidian Gates
			* The Great Cavern
			* The Sundered Span
			* The Forum of Set
			* The Inn of the Lost
	* Personalities
		* They have heard the name Deino (3-158) from the beastmen, and assume her to be a beastman leader
		* They also know of Kerbog Khan the sorcerer (SL12-25), and assume he has control of an entire level
		* They know of and fear High Priestess Stephania of the cult of Set (4-51)
		* They know of a grand king of the goblins, named Witsen (actually Weskenim, at SL4-22)
		* They know that Gog (5-2) is a wise hermit who aids the needy
		* They consider Lankios to be crazy but harmless (1-6)
		* Their men have conversed with / been ranted at by a very strange druid’ named Gerrilad in the woods north of the the ruined city (2-69).
	* Treasures and Hoards
		* They have heard of the following treasures and tombs, and will confidently supply incorrect directions to each:
			* Muirasso’s Tomb (5-36 to 5-40)
			* The lost library of Thoth, containing powerful spells unknown to present wizards (2-70 and 2-72)
			* The tomb of the great hero, Larel One-Eye (3-46)
			* The tomb of the conqueror-archon, Marius the Great (6-154).
			* They also speak confidently of two non-existent tombs: Huree the Ecophont (a known tall-tale) and Tristion Varrell (actually believed).
