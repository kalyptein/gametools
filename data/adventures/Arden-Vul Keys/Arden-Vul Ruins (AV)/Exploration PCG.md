d20) Form, Sample Inscription, GM Notes to Sample Inscriptions 

1-2
Fragment of plaster stele

… Lord Vul wrought great magicks, and lo! the Gates were formed, of the blackest obsidian … shewed forth the keys, of which there were two … and the golden key was deeded to …. but the second key made of …. 66 copies …. to the lord Prior of Thoth.

An incorrect myth concerning the creation of the Obsidian Gates (5-6D). In fact, the Gates date to 
the heqeti period, although they were modified and enhanced by the rudishva. Vul and Arden merely (re)discovered the Obsidian Gates when they first explored the area. The Archonteans never really penetrated beyond the Gates, and never figured out the keys. Two keys are necessary to open the Obsidian Gates, one gold and one platinum. The Prior of Thoth was the administrative leader of the Cult of Thoth, which dominated Levels 2-3 and 5; the wealth of the Priors is found at 3-63.

3-4
Bust, 3’ diameter, with inscription on base

Marius Tricotor, archon of Arden Vul in the 150th year of its founding, who defeated the monstrous troll-things and re-established peace among the peoples.

Refers to the famous Marius, governor of Arden Vul at its peak. See the Lay of Marius (see Arden Vul books). His tomb is located at 6-154.

5-6
Polished bone (1=femur, 2=skull, 3=ulna, 4=scapula, 5=hip, 6=non-human)

Upon application of the hot iron Sicandros the barbarian revealed the location of the tomb of Muirasso the archon … beside the bridge leading to the lower levels.

The unplundered tomb of Muirasso, imperial archon, is located at 5-36 to 5-40. Sicandros was the architect of the tomb.

7-8
Medallion

In commemoration of that peace which was finally obtained between the warring Sortians and the Theosophs.

Refers to the war of the Sortians and Theosophs, that destructive conflict that sundered the old empire and provoked a millennium of imperial contraction. A modern Order of Priscians that claims descent from the Sortians has its base at areas 9-58 to 9-64. See the World of Archontos appendix for additional information on the groups above.

9-10
Fragment of a picture-vase

Alexandros, servant of the mighty Lord, who helped tame the Great Cavern and cultivate the spores.

Alexandros is an otherwise forgotten agent of Ptarmis, the great Thothian priest who brought the Great Cavern (areas 3-163 and 3-172) under Archontean control. Also refers to the fungal foresters (see new monsters) who inhabit those caverns.

11-12
Fragment of mosaic 

The Old Ones travelled here by mighty sky-chariot … fire and destruction … look to the Beacon for answers.

Fragments of Archontean lore about the rudishva. The ‘sky-chariot’ was the Beacon, the rudishva spaceship. Remnants of the Beacon are scattered throughout the Halls, e.g., SL2-2, 6-27, 6-113, 7-143, SL13-37, and SL14-10.

13-14
Bit of tile

Priscus the unbeliever led the rebellion against the Emperor and was joined by …. the treachery of the ancient allies.

A reference to Priscus Pulcher, one of the principal leader of the Sortians in antiquity.

15
Ivory triptych

The cliff entrance to the lower levels is quite vulnerable … seek other defenses against the foe.

Refers to area EX-14, which led to the precinctsof Set on Level 4.

16
Ceremonial stone stele

The Ritual of Enhancement. Face our lord Vul and chant the incantation …..

A reference to the magical effect that may be produced at AV-31.

17
Enameled plaque

Vul’s Insight takes three days to receive, and is wearying due to the need to chant the incantation four times per hour. Do not falter, or the consequences shall be severe!

Another reference to AV-31.

18
Pectoral or torc, 25% it’s made of precious metal

Lo, the incantation to Vul!
Empty the mind, open the heart, fill the soul / Empty the soul, open the mind, fill the heart / Empty the heart, open the soul, fill the mind.

The key to activating the magical effect at AV-31.

19
Tapestry fragment
All warriors know the Song of Arden, that most beautiful verse which banishes doubt and brings them courage and stamina. Sing it to Lady Arden, and she will not leave you!

A reference to AV-30.

20
Carved crystal set over gold base (125 gp)

… of Arden: Fear is the destroyer, it bites in the heart. Fear brings me low, makes me writhe in the dirt. Strength counters fear, pushes it deep in its hole; strength is my strength, let it fill all my soul.

The key to activating the magical effect at AV-30.

d20) Puzzling Clue, GM Explanation
* 1) A bronze key.

* 2) A 1.25”-diameter and 3”-long rod of stone, with a thin covering of silver on one end.
	* A hint concerning the keys to the Obsidian Gates (5-6D). The general shape and material is correct, but this rod is too small in diameter and too long in length.
* 3) Two 8” glass activation squares, one blue and one red (see Thothian teleportation rings).
	* An incomplete set of ‘address cards’ for a Thothian teleportation ring.
* 4) A scrap of parchment with a code on it.
	* GM’s choice.
* 5) A scrap of parchment in Archontean reading “Gog knows. Trust him.”
	* Refers to Gog, the lesser varumani exiled from the troll thegn’s court (7-75) and current resident of 5-2. 
* 6) A broken femur on which is incised these directions in Wiskin: "from stone seat, South 10, West 50, South 10."
	* These directions (in feet) lead to the grave of Ptarmis (3-174) in the Fungal Forest (3-172), using the Stone Seat at 3-176 as a starting point.
* 7) A clay tablet with the following in Elvish: “the howlers fear the light. Restore the well.”
	* Refers to the albino baboons of Level 2 and offers a clue as to help diminish their threat by restoring the mirror at 2-1.
* 8) A scrap of faded papyrus with an image of bubbling vats; over them is written ‘evil’ and ‘Deino is a witch’ in Mithric.
	* Deino is the witch who rules the beastmen from her lair in 3-158. The note provides a warning as to her true nature.
* 9) An oblong piece of bronze, stamped on one side with a monstrous, tusked, grinning head, and on the other with a hammer. Item is 1/4” thick, 3” high, and 8” long.
	* A troll thegn's passport allowing safe access to the varumani domain (7-1).
* 10) A silk bag holding 6 irregular pieces – a few grey, a few orange - of an extremely hard but non-metallic substance.

* 11) A 1”-diameter disk of orange ‘metal;’ the roman numeral V is scratched into it.
	* A rudishva lesser power supply, with 5 charges remaining.
* 12) A treasure map, torn into quarters - only three of the pieces are extant.
	* GM’s choice.
* 13) A wooden ‘puzzle statuette’ of carved, fitted, and polished pieces of ebony in the form of a turtle; if the head is pulled forward and pushed downward, the shell will pop off, revealing a golden key. 
	* The key is to the secret door in 3-60. The statuette could be sold for 50 gp.
* 14) A ‘Russian doll’ statuette of a squatting, salamander-shaped being with a huge mouth; made of lacquered maple; if all eight pieces are extant, one can read a prayer (Mithric) to Rimmaq-Isfet on the bottom of the statuette. Currently three pieces are missing.
	* The statuette could be sold for 100-400 gp. It contains a hint as to the nature of the heqeti foe, especially on Level 10.
* 15) A fist-sized sapphire, cut to resemble an eye, with a bit of jet inset as the pupil. 
	* The sapphire is worth 2,000 gp. It is a sapphire Sortian eye (see new magic items).
* 16) A coarse linen bag with a set of polished augury sticks. The bag is embroidered “Only those without ideology may find the way” (in Mithric).
	* If cast by a person of True Neutral alignment, the sticks spell out directions from area 3-67 to the Sanctum (5-83).
* 17) A scrap of parchment with notes written in Thorcin: “Grithnal did not understand the clues in the dread tomb of Sethu. We must return with scrolls of protection, for Thoth will not release his wealth lightly.”

* 19) A piece of linen onto which has been drawn a rectangle divided into two rows of three colored squares each. Below the rectangle is the phrase “Summoning Hall” in Wiskin. 
	* From left to right, top to bottom, the colors are: WH-YE-BL-GR-RE-BK. This is the ‘address’ to the Thothian teleportation ring in area 2-19 (see new magic items).
* 20) A 1'-tall, enchanted silver ankh, chased with red glass, worth 125 gp.
	* One of the ankh-keys used to activate the obelisks (AV-5, AV-28, AV-41) in the ruins of the city.

* 8) Leather-bound codex of 1-100 leaves, blank save for 1-6 valuable entries (10-60 gp each).

#### Table 8: Lost Cache

* A hidden cache of valuables.
	* Adjust as necessary, especially if the PCs have already found a cache.
	* Any cache has a flat 25% chance of attracting Craastonistorex's attention (AV-40). Certain results may increase the chance.
	* Each cache has a chance of being trapped (GM’s choice of trap) or also being the lair of a creature (table 5).

d8) % trap or monster, Description

* 8) 30%, 1-3 magic weapons and 1-2 miscellaneous magic items of low power.
	* +35% chance of attracting the wyrm.

#### Table 9: Lost Cellar or Room

* A relatively intact chamber in the rubble. The value and role of this chamber is up to the GM to decide.
	* Recommended: an additional 2-3 entry points to the dungeon be discoverable in this manner.
		* They should be trapped in some manner and lead to a small sub-level of the DM’s devising which then connects to one of the main levels.
		* These entry points should be rare, perhaps only discoverable after clues to their existence are found (conversations with Lankios (1-6) or Craastonistorex (AV-40), finding an inscription, etc.).
	* Otherwise
		* The cellar or chamber will have some combination of results from tables 2-8.
		* A safe cellar might prove to be a valuable spot to establish a refuge.
