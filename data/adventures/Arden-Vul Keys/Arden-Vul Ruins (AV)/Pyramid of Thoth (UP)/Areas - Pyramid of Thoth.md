### Exterior

* This enormous pyramid, some 90’ square and 45’ high, occupies its own square just north of the Forum.
	* Marble steps rise on each side of the pyramid to a 30' square central platform sheathed in white marble.
	* Above the platform is a stone canopy of dark grey granite, supported by marble and porphyry pillars. Beneath the canopy is the cult statue of Thoth, a 20’-tall ibis-headed person in classic Egyptian pose.

### Pyramid Steps

* 120 marble steps rise on each side of the pyramid at a 22.5-degree angle to the central platform. 
	* The steps are worn in the center from traffic (particularly on the eastern side).
	* Several of the steps are cracked, but as the marble slabs rest on granite, there is little chance of danger from the decrepitude. 
* An image has been carved into the exact center of each riser. Four images alternate, such that there are thirty exemplars of each image.
	* Ibis-headed Thoth pointing both arms at a robed human descending a staircase.
		* GM Note: depicts the safer way to manipulate the Statue of Thoth the Guardian and open a path to the Halls of Arden Vul. By rotating the statue’s hands so that they both point straight out, one opens the staircase to UP-2, instead of UP-6.
	* Ibis-headed Thoth pointing his left arm at a bowing human, who is presenting the god with a plate of scrolls and coins.
		* GM Note: a clue to the manipulation of the statues of Thoth at 3-2, and 3-15, 3-40; rotating the left hands of all three statues to this position opens the door to the secret treasury at 3-23 and 3-24.
	* Ibis-headed Thoth spewing forth a long scroll inscribed with (abstract) writing into the hands of grateful humans.
		* GM Note: a reminder that Thoth is the source of wisdom.
	* A baboon squatting with an open book on its thighs, holding a pen in its paw, and gazing at a group of humans; a feather appears between the baboon and the people. 
		* GM Note: an image of Thoth as recorder of the Book of the Dead; the feather is the feather of Maat, or justice.

### Pyramid Platform

* The 30’-square platform is sheathed in white marble. A dark grey granite canopy rises 30’ above the platform to accommodate the enormous cult statue of Thoth. Purple porphyry columns support the canopy.
	* Crouching at the foot of each column is a heavily pitted 4’-tall statue of a crouching baboon, with its mouth slightly open as if barking.

Statue of Thoth the Glorious
* 20’-tall statue of Thoth represents the epitome of the sculptor’s trade.
	* Carved out of a solid block of porphyry, and topped with a white marble ibis head, the statue is truly awe-inspiring.
	* Two grapefruit-sized lumps of shaped jade serve as eyes.
		* Trying to remove the eyes causes blasts of blue lightning from the mouths of the baboon statues. One blast each round from a random baboon, inflicts 2d6 damage on the desecrator. Removal takes 4-16 rounds.
		* If removed, two greater guardians of Thoth teleport to the pyramid and assault the desecrators.
			* 2 greater guardians of Thoth (see new monsters): SZ L; AL LN; AC 0; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 62, 56; #AT 4 or 1; Dmg 1-8/1-8/1-8/1-8 or 1-12; MR 20%. Special attacks: fear, stun. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; teleport without error 2/day.
		* Each eye is worth 10,000 gp, but will impart a curse (GM’s choosing) they who sells them.
	* The god’s arms rest flat at his side, but may in fact be manipulated.
		* If both arms are rotated to point straight up towards the sky, the cover (UP-1) grinds and slides to the east, revealing a staircase descending to the south (UP-6).
		* If both arms are rotated to point out parallel to the floor, the cover will slide to the west, revealing a different staircase leading to the north (UP-2).
		* After an hour, the arms will return to the statue’s side, and the cover at UP-1 smoothly slides shut.
	* Those offering an invocation to Thoth before (or while) manipulating the arms receive a blessing from Thoth (as Bless spell, lasting 6 turns).

## UP-1: Cover for Stairs

* Directly in front of the statue of Thoth is a 10’ x 5’ section of pavement obviously distinct from the rest of the platform.
	* This section slides in two directions, but is only operable by manipulating the arms of the statue of Thoth.
	* Should the arms of the statue both be rotated to pointing straight up, the cover will grind to the east, revealing a steep set of stairs (UP-6) leading southwards and down into the dark.
	* Should both arms be raised to positions parallel to the floor, the cover will grind to the east, revealing another set of stairs (UP-2) leading north into the darkness.
	* After an hour, the arms of Thoth will return to rest, and the cover will slide shut.

### UP-2: Stairs

* Composed of rough granite blocks, heavily worn by the passage of feet. They descend steeply to the north and end up at UP-3.
* The ceiling of the stairwell was originally plastered and decorated, but today only tiny shreds of plaster remain.
* At the head of the stairs, just under UP-1, is an iron handle that will allow the cover to be slid aside to allow egress from the dungeon below.

### UP-3: Upper Landing

* This tiny room only exists to allow the stairs to change their direction. There is nothing in this room, which only boasts about 25-square feet of floor space. All ornamentation has been stripped from the walls.
* Graffiti of many vintages and natures covers the walls.

##### UP-3a: Second Stair

* The stair from UP-3 is less steep, but equally worn (i.e., wear-marks in each step). Plaster shreds hang from the walls and ceiling.
	* Little graffiti is found here. 

### UP-4: Preparation Room

* This large chamber (20’ square, 10’ tall) is brightly lit, thanks to countless continual light spells cast by adventurers on the ceiling.
* Whatever plaster once covered the walls has long disappeared; the walls are bare stone, and are covered with graffiti (use table from UP-3 or improvise).
* To the left of the stairwell is a circle made of bits of stone that has been used as a fire pit; scorched charcoal and bones are found inside it.

There is a 3 in 8 chance of an encounter here. If one is indicated, it will be as follows: 

D6 Encounter
1
A pack of 1-6 rats (normal); 50% likely to flee

2
3-6 giant rats: SZ S; AL N(E); AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1; #At 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: 5% chance of disease

3
Treasure map, roll d4: 1=fake, 2=fragmentary, 3=treasure is already gone, 4=usable

4
A halfling exploration party: 

Roskelly Winterleaf, 5th-level halfling thief: SZ S; AL CE; AC 5; MV 90’; HD 5, HP 22; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (short sword) or 2-5 (dagger). Abilities: STR 16, INT 9, WIS 10, DEX 17, CON 10, CHA 15. Thief skills: PP 60%, OL 62%, F/RT 50%, MS 52%, HS 57%, HN 25%, CW 77%, RL 30%. Special attacks: poison; both weapons are coated “Mortality” poison (see 3-4), which has an onset of 2-8 rounds, and does 20 HP damage, or half if a save is made. Possessions: leather armor; short sword; dagger; potion of invisibility. 

5 1st-level halfling fighters: SZ S; AL NE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 1; HP: 10, 9, 8, 8, 7; #AT 1; Dmg 2-7 (spear), 2-7 (club), or 2-5 (sling). Possessions: studded leather armor and shield; spears; clubs; slings; one has a potion of ventriloquism.

5: leaving after taking casualties, with treasure; 6: leaving after taking casualties, without treasure

6
A beastman patrol consisting of 6 troopers and a sergeant:

6 beastman troopers (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LN; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 1+1; HP: 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 5; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: tactics. Possessions: ring mail and shield; spears; short swords; short bows; one has a potion of delusion.

1 beastman sergeant (see new monsters): SZ S; AL LN; AC 4; MV 90’: HD 2+2; HP 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 or 2-5. Special attacks: tactics. Possessions: ring mail and shield; spear; war hammer


### UP-5: Stairs to Level 3 (aka 3-1)

* These stairs descend some 350’ into the heart of the complex of Thoth and eventually debouch at Level 3-2.
* See description of the stairs at Level 3-1.

### UP-6: Unworn Stairs (Dangerous Entrance)

* These stairs are made of marble blocks, and appear in very good shape. They are considerably less worn than those at UP-2. The plaster here is also gone.
	* Six corpses in various states of decomposition lie along the staircase. 
		* Among the six corpses are three long swords, a quarter staff, a set of usable leather armor +1, a medium shield, and two purses with 37 sp and 24 gp respectively.
	* Each riser of the 45 steps from UP-6 to UP-7 is incised with an image of a different animal; these include a hippo, crocodile, ibis, baboon, giraffe, etc.
		* Three stairs from the top the animal is a scorpion; next to the scorpion has also been incised, in Mithric, “safety”.
		* GM Note: this is a hint about how to escape the trap that governs areas UP-6 to UP-11; it refers to the bust of Selket in UP-11, which is the only (easy) way to escape this area.
* Unlike at UP-1, no convenient iron handle exists to allow the cover to be slid away. This means that once the lid slides shut after an hour, it is impossible to exit the dungeon from this point (short of powerful magic).
	* A kind GM might allow for a deus ex machina rescue: Lankios the Hermit (1-6), a beastman patrol, or Kronos Kettle-Belly (AV-22) and his men. A lift gates roll (at -5% due to the cramped conditions) might also force the cover open. 
* Once the lid leading to UP-6 has closed, every turn one of the corpses that litter the areas lurches into undead activity and comes for the intruders.
	* Roll 1d10 and consult the following table; the results determine what type of undead awakens and the location where it rises.

9
Roll d6+2 twice

10

Roll d6+2 thrice
The existence of three, potentially different, groups of undead is the product of the demise of a previous adventuring party.


GM Note: Since the priests of Thoth designed this ‘dangerous’ entrance to punish those who were insufficiently unaware of the mysteries of Thoth, this trap is naturally quite deadly. 

Some hints as to its nature exist, including the barely worn stairs and the corpses that are found in every area. Still, some groups may well find themselves trapped beneath the pyramid after the cover slides shut; the only hope for such groups, which will face a continuous cycle of undead activity, is to locate UP-11 and employ the teleporter attached to the bust of Selket (q.v.). Hints about the existence of that exit are indicated in several places among areas UP-6 to UP-11.

### UP-7: Upper Landing

* Like UP-3, this chamber is tiny and exists merely to redirect the stairs. Its clean marble floor is largely undamaged, although it is littered with plaster fragments.
	* Six sets of mostly skeletal remains lie on the floor, but without any equipment.
	* Remarkably little graffiti exists here, but what does exist is ominous:

##### Alarmed Graffiti

D8 Graffiti Notes

1
Frumious ever not Green! 

Language: Thorcin Mad ramblings.

2
We’re doomed unless we find the scorpion!
Language: Archontean

A hint that PCs must find the scorpion at UP-11 to escape.

3
Durko fell here. We hope he won’t join the dead ones. 
Language: Dwarvish

A hint about the trap that governs this part of the pyramid, through which corpses keep rising to attack the living.

4
Durko was lucky, but we are not. We waited too long before searching for the scorpion and now the way is blocked.
Language: Dwarvish

Another hint that PCs must find the scorpion at UP-11.

5
Jeril was taken by the last onslaught. Where’s the exit? There must be one! 
Language: Thorcin

6
The lid is closed and we cannot open it. I hear another one rising. Where can we go?
Language: Archontean

7
KK sees all! The dragonflies are everywhere!
Language: Archontean

A reference to Kerbog Khan (SL12-25), and his dragonfly automatons

8
Ha! So long, suckers! We found it! The scorpion’s tail is the way out.
Language: Archontean

Another hint that the PCs must find the scorpion at UP-11 to escape.

### UP-8: Lower Stair

* This long (90’) marble stair leads downward at a less steep slope than the staircase at UP-6.
	* Bits of plaster are still in evidence, and depict rather generalized and repetitive images of Thoth, with blazing eyes.
* Characters standing at the top of the stairs can see a bright light at their base (the continual light spell at UP-9).
	* Five moldering corpses lie along the stairs, bereft of usable equipment.
* Trap (last 30’ of the stairs)
	* On a roll of 1-2 out of 6, a weight of 200 lb or more causes the last 30’ of the stairs to flatten out into a slide that drops anyone unfortunate enough to be on them onto the trap door at UP-9. The trap door opens on a roll of 1-5 out of 6.
	* A clever PC might resist sliding by making a successful roll of 3d6+2 under STR. 

### UP-9: Lower Landing

* This small chamber is brightly lit, thanks to a continual light spell cast here over a century ago. The stair ends in a 10’x10’ room.
	* Across from the stair appears to be a 5’-tall stone door (the door is actually a false door that cannot be opened). The walls are marble, and completely devoid of imagery or graffiti, save for a hastily painted image of a scorpion with the words ‘Where is it?’ scrawled underneath it in Archontean.
	* Five corpses of adventurers, bereft of equipment are decomposing in the landing.
* Trap
	* There is a covered pit (25’ deep and 5’ square) at the foot of the stairs.
		* Pressure in excess of 100 lb opens the pit door, depositing the unlucky PC(s) into the Pit of Bones (UP-10), dealing 4-14 falling damage.
		* This almost certainly happens to those caught by the slide trap (UP-8).
		* If the slide does not activate, the pit trap will still be activated by the first 100 lb of weight placed on the square at the foot of the stairs.
		* The walls of the pit are pitted with regularly spaced holes, allowing the vorantes demons (UP-11) to climb up the pit.

### UP-10: Pit of Bones

* The Pit of Bones is totally dark with a thick carpet of dry bones and broken adventuring equipment littering the chamber floor.
	* A stench of decay, age, and evil lingers in this foul charnel heap.
	* The sheer amount of random equipment and treasure mixed among the bones means that there is a 10% chance that any weapon, set of armor, or bit of equipment found on the standard equipment list can be found here.
		* No food will be found, nor any drink, nor any potions or magic items.
		* Lengthy searching produces 1d100 ancient and unfamiliar coins per hour (60% will be copper, 25% will be silver, 10% will be gold, and 5% will be platinum), max 250 gp value available.
			* For each hour of searching, there is a 5% cumulative chance to uncover a gemstone (d100 x 5 gp), max 1,750 gp in gems available.
	* Mucking about in the Pit of Bones can attract the attention of the vorantes demons (UP-11), starting at 25% and rising 10% every Turn spent searching.
		* Once attracted, a vorantes follows its prey until defeated. Once one vorantes has taken the ‘scent’ of the PCs, a second will follow in 1-6 turns, and a third 1-4 turns after that.
	* A small archway (about 4’ tall) is cut into the far wall, leading to UP-11.

### UP-11: Lair of the Vorantes Demons and Exit

* A bare chamber of worked stone, only 5’ tall.
	* A floating black disk 3’ in diameter, a gate to the home plane of the vorantes demons.
		* If all vorantes are defeated, a new one arrives in 1-4 hours, and then 1 more per hour until three are present.
		* If the GM wishes, the gate might be two-way, allowing the foolhardy to venture to the demonic home plane of the vorantes. 
	* In the NE corner, a 4’-tall bust of a lioness head on a human bust, on top of which crouches a scorpion (an image of Sekhmet).
		* Around the bust (initially covered by dust) is a 7’-diameter semi-circle of lapis inset in the stone.
		* The bust is stone,once brightly painted, with a scorpion on its crown.
			* The stinger of the scorpion can be pulled forward. The eyes of Sekhmet burn with a crescendo of white light, and after 5 seconds anything inside the 7’-diameter circle of lapis is teleported to a random location (d6) 
				* 1 The Great Hall (3-123)
				* 2 The Hall of Judgment (2-35)
				* 3 The parvis of the Great Cavern (3-175)
				* 4 The cave of Gog (5-2)
				* 5 The Flooded Vaults (SL7-8)
				* 6 GM’s choice on Levels 5-8
	* A trio of voracious vorantes demons dwells in this chamber, which their ancient contract compels them to guard.
		* They appear initially as inert, 2’-diameter orbs.  After 1-6 rounds, they roll towards any carbon-based life-form and attack.
			* 3 vorantes demons (see new monsters): SZ S; AL CE; AC 4; MV 120’; HD 4; HP 28, 26, 24, 21; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8; MR 10%. Special attacks: gnaw. Special defenses: take 1 less HP damage per die versus fire and cold. Special: demonic telepathy; can see in absolute darkness.
		* The vorantes are also intimidated by the lapis circle surrounding the bust of Sekhmet, and will wait 1-4 rounds before attacking any within the circle.
		* The vorantes may already have been attracted by noise in UP-10, and thus may well have been encountered and/or slain elsewhere in the complex.
		* The vorantes have collected certain bits of non-organic glitter.
			* Some of it is junk (bits of quartz and crystal gnawed out of their original settings; scraps of lapis lazuli; some tattered bits of colored cloth)
			* A ring of protection +2; a ring of delusion; a gem of insight; a pearl of power (1st-level); an inlaid silver bracer worth 500 gp; a bejeweled rod worth 250 gp; a pair of star rubies worth 1,000 gp each, and a gem-studded wand (just panoply, but worthy 135 gp).
