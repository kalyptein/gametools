## Overview

The City of Arden-Vul
* The ancient empire of Archontos established the settlement of Arden Vul on this plateau for reasons both strategic and sorcerous.
	* It was named for the two heroes, Arden and Vul, who located the chambers beneath the plateau and served as the governors of Arden Vul for more than a decade.
* The city (more properly a town) was largely devoted to scholarly and sorcerous pursuits; that is, it was not an open city, nor did it grow up on a trade route.
	* At its peak, Arden Vul covered an area of only about 16 hectares, or about 1.8 million square feet, and had a population (mostly of elite specialists) of 10,000.
	* Entrance to and from Arden Vul was carefully scrutinized, and those permitted to live within were those whom the Empire needed or wanted.
	* The longest-lived and most important organization in the ancient city was the temple of Thoth.
	* Foodstuffs and other necessities were largely shipped in, either by sorcery, or from the latifundia created in the valley below.
* Due to its non-mercantile nature, the town was marked by a large proportion of monumental building, both of temples and of palaces for important functionaries of the Empire.
	* As the Archontean Empire waned, the city came to be seen as a retreat and safe haven, and in its last centuries was marked by greater militarization and frantic excavations below.

The Fall of Arden-Vul
* Eventually, like the empire at large, the city became riven by two factions known as the Sortians and the Theosophs.
	* The Sortians, led by Priscus Pulcher, Isadora, and others, sought to open access to magical training and knowledge to all those who possessed the gift
	* The Theosophs, led by the powerful and conservative temples of Thoth, Horus, and Set, sought to preserve the restrictive and hierarchical model that had endured for centuries.
* During this period of civil disorder much digging occurred below, as rival groups staked out a position.
* The city was finally destroyed in a cataclysmic event 1,210 years ago, one that leveled and scorched its precincts.

Adrienic's Expedition
* Some 250 years ago (post-Church of the Imperial Flame), during the most recent phase of Imperial rebirth and expansion, Emperor Phocion IV sent an expedition under the command of the archon Adrienic to reclaim Arden Vul (and search for arcanum). Adrienic established his seat in the middle Halls (e.g. 5-18), but the expedition was destroyed by the varumani after less than 20 years.

Arden Vul Today
* Largely a ruin. Its walls have almost completely collapsed, allowing plants and animals to move into the ruin.
* The gate towers are in better repair, and many still stand (or have been repaired).
* Most of the western side of the city has become a swamp due to the failure of the irrigation and drainage efforts instituted by the Archonteans.
* The east side is in better shape, with a broad boulevard running from north to south, and several monumental structures still intact.
	* The Great Pyramid of Thoth (AV-15) is visible to all those who enter the now-ruined town.
* Forest covers the plateau beyond the city itself, lighter toward the city where land was once cleared, with old-growth beyond that.

Those considering the cause of the demise of Arden Vul observe:
* The east side (except the pyramid) seems flattened by a wall of enormous force, as if a child has swept through a block-city with her hands.
* The western side, and the remaining foundations of the east side, appear charred by enormous heat. 

Iconic Features
* Pyramid of Thoth (AV-15)
* Donjon of Arden Vul (AV-27)
* Archon's Palace (AV-29)


## AV 1 - 15
### AV-1: The Cliff Gate

* The 40' wide gate leads from the Long Stair to the start of the Boulevard of Knowledge (AV-6) with the Obelisk of the Sun (AV-5) just ahead.
* Two massive round towers guarded the gate, each about 35’ in diameter and 45’ tall.
	* The towers had 4 floors, but the top level of each has been destroyed by violent force.  The cliff-facing side of the east tower has collapsed.
	* The wooden gate has long since disappeared, allowing the curious to enter through a 40’-wide gaping passageway between the looming gate towers. 
* West Tower: a shell of stone with nothing but rubble, shards of wood, and cobwebs within.
	* Arrow slits offer a view into the dark interior.
	* A pack of huge spiders has made this tower their lair, but the spiders hunt in the eastern districts, not in the entrance plaza.  
		* 1. 6 huge spiders: SZ M; AL N; AC 6; MV 180’; HD 2+2; HP 16, 15, 15, 12, 13, 11; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: surprise 1-5; poison (+1 to saves); can leap up to 30’.
	* A sack with 45 ancient gold solidi.
* East Tower: the northern face of the tower still stands, but the southern (cliff-side) face has collapsed.  There is nothing remaining within.

### AV-2: City Walls

* Originally 20’ tall, and 15’ thick, most portions are now collapsed.
* Remaining wall sections (on map) are covered with vines, ivy, shrubs and trees; climbing is easy.
	* They are rickety; collapse 50% of the time if climbed on.  DEX check vs 3 or 2d6 damage.

### AV-3 & AV-4: Generic Round & Square Towers (Generic)

* Towers are generally 30’ high and 25’ wide.
	* Round are older.  Three floors.  Conical tiled roof and two bands of geometric tile and brick-work at 15’ and 20’ respectively.
	* Square towers were part of a later building program by the authorities of Arden Vul.  Three floors with wooden stairs, and an open, machicolated roof.
* Tower Status (d8)
	* 1-3) Utterly obliterated, under tons of rubble
	* 4) Mostly gone, 25% chance of a 10’-diameter safe area
	* 5) Portions of ground floor still intact
	* 6) Portions of ground and first floors intact
	* 7) Most of three interior floors intact, but roof is gone (roll for inhabitants at -1)
	* 8) Intact tower (roll for inhabitants)
* For any but mostly intact towers, poking around forces DEX check vs 3 or d6 from falling masonry.
* 10% chance for roll on small valuables table (see Exploration PCG Table 3).

### AV-5: Obelisk of the Sun

* One of three huge granite obelisks (others are at AV-28 and AV-41).
* Weather-beaten, standing proudly amid the utter ruin around it.
* 10’ square base, rising 35’; it is incised with bands of inscriptions and images
	* Inscriptions (Mithric): references to the Twelve, the names of the first 327 emperors of the Archontean Empire.
	* Images: for the first 8’ feet of its height, the images are largely of humans interacting with large lizards, riding on the lizards, putting various creatures to the sword, and so forth. Above this level the images turn to a single theme: the sun. 
	* A wide band on the south face of the obelisk at 5’ in height; clear of marks except a deeply incised 1'-tall image of an ankh and the Mithric inscription: “The Beacon shall be revealed to those who bring midday life to the Sun, the Moon and the Stars.”
	* Radiates magic of locking and opening.
* If the ankh slot on all three obelisks are slotted with ankh-keys at noon, a grinding noise rings out across the ruins.
	* Steel doors set in the pavement at AV-34 grind open, swinging down /  inward, showering a clatter of rubble and dust onto a set of broad stairs leading down to the legendary ‘Chamber of the Beacon’ (SL14-1).

### AV-6: Boulevard of Knowledge

* A 50’-wide boulevard, paved with large cobblestones, leading from the Long Stair to the Grand Forum.
	* The cobblestones are buckled and cracked with age, and trees grow out of the cracks.
	* Ancient oak trees line the boulevard on either side.

### AV-7: Grand Forum

* Once a site for imperial announcements, public discussions, and business, now devastated.
	* Stumps of pillars, broken off between 3’ and 8’ in height, line the outer borders; their busts  fallen to the pavement.  The paving stones are tilted, stained, and cracked. 
	* Small trees have grown up here and there, and stumps of larger ones dot the pavement.
	* Only three of the large ornamental trees remain: a massive, ancient oak in the center of the forum, and two majestic maples in the southern section.
* The surrounding districts are almost entirely leveled, as if by a great wind.
	* A consistent landscape of rubble, trees, and shrubs about 8’ in height except for save for The Pyramid of Thoth (AV-15) and the Tower of Scrutiny (AV-8).
	* A few paths have been carved through the rubble.
* Encounters are more common at this crossroads; check 1-in-6 every hour.
* Tuftwillig the Oak
	* Vast canopy, a great tangling of roots.
	* Sentient (druids have 1-in-6 chance to sense), but quiescent.  Over 800 years old, it moved here shortly after the abandonment of the city.  Hasn't moved in many centuries and is loath to do so.
		* Tuftwillig, the sentient tree: SZ L; AL N; AC 0; MV 10’; HD 12; HP 89; #AT 2; Dmg 4-24/4-24. Special attacks: summon animals.
	* Difficult to wake: 2-in-6 for loud noise.  Threat of fire will work, but it'll be most unhappy.
	* May know information about the city (the obelisks, entrances to the Halls below), etc.
		* Will want a favor in return.  E.g., eliminating the baboon tower (AV-9); freeing Lankios from his curse (1-6); recovering a druid artifact from a known area of the halls or a specific named entity inside the halls. 
		* Unhappy about Craastonistorex’s presence (AV-40).  If it likes the party, it may assist  with information useful against the wyrm or, more rarely, with summoned animals.  It will only bestir itself in extremely unusual and dire cases.
	* Tuftwillig has two items hidden in his roots.
		* Ring of Acid Resistance, given to him by a druid when he was a young tree (he'll only offer it to the most trusted allies, and only if they can demonstrate great need).
		* The left hand of the colossal statue of Arden (AV-30).  He will give this to anyone who asks, so long as they are polite and respectful.

### AV-8: Tower of Scrutiny

* The Tower of Scrutiny looms over the Grand Forum; 40’ square, 45’ high (4 stories), and made of granite blocks.  Still intact among the surrounding rubble, shielded by is ties to Thoth.
	* The top floor is punctuated with a series of broad windows (see TS-12).  The rest of the tower is windowless.
	* A pair of 8' tall, massive bronze doors open to the Forum carved with symbols of Thoth: ibises, baboons, moons, magical glyphs, and multiple iterations of the Archontean alphabet.
		* They are locked and wizard locked (12th level, see TS-1).
			* Keys are in TS-16 and SL5-2 (they don't bypass the wizard lock).
		* Touching the letters to spell any secret name of Thoth causes the doors to glide open noiselessly, opening both ward and lock.
			* The names, e.g., “Thrice Great”) obtainable from the books "Thoth in All His Forms" or "Secreta Secretorum".
		* They close after a turn, regardless of how they were opened.
		* They require the same means to open from inside as well as out.
	* Side Secret Door: there is a locked secret door on the west side of the tower (TS-6).
		* Difficult lock w/ -15% to check.
	* The priesthood of Thoth used it to oversee public discourse in the forum and to serve as a symbol of imperial might.  It was the headquarters of the Over-Seer of Thoth.

* A square tower, it's exterior intact.
	* Rango, a giant intelligent baboon, has led other albino baboons here from Level 2.

* The Troop
	* 8 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 22, 20, 20, 19, 19, 18, 18, 16; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### AV-10: Baboon Cave (leading to 2-54)

* Just outside the eastern walls is an overgrown dry cistern.
	* A wide (4’) crack in its bottom leads by circuitous tunnels down 225’ to 2-54.
		* The tunnel is small and cramped, no more than 5’ high, and in some places only 3’x3’.
		* It will take an hour of strenuous, claustrophobic crawling, dragging armor and gear behind.
		* Check (1-in-6) for encountering baboons at the cistern, during the crawl, and just before they exit below.
			* 4 large albino baboons (see new monsters): SZ M; AL N; MV 120’; AC 6; HD 3; HP 20, 19, 18, 18; #AT 3; Dmg 1-4/1-4/1-6. Special attacks: pack attack.

### AV-11: Ghoul Nest

* In a cellar in the ruins south of the Eastern Plaza (AV-13), a pod of ghouls lairs, emerging to hunt at night.
	* The entrance is hard to locate among the rubble.
	* Among the bones and trash: a set of copper candelabra and bowls (1,975 cp); a circular electrum mirror 3’ round (1,000 gp, very heavy); a potion of clairvoyance, a potion of polymorph (self), and a Shield of Dubious Faith.
* The Pod
	* 8 ghouls: SZ M; AL CE; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 15, 14, 13, 13, 12, 11, 11, 10; #AT 3; Dmg 1-3/1-3/1-6. Special attacks: paralysis. Special defenses: immune to sleep and charm.

### AV-12: Eastgate (w/ access to 3-52A)

* The upper two-thirds of both towers lie in ruins under heaps of broken stone. 
* South Tower: persistent digging reveals one random object from the table below (d6):
	* 1) corpse of an Imperial administrator, with a parchment description of "the accursed rebels on their fire-breathing mounts" (dragon-riders), 6 ancient octagonal platinum coins, and a 75 gp silver pectoral (a knot surrounding a stylized drop of liquid, sign of the Sortians)
	* 2) 1-3 vials of flame-red liquid (Potions of Fire Breath)
	* 3) A wax tablet written (Mithric) “That suck-up, Lucius Cornelius, took Lord Marius’s relics to his own abode. He said he needed them to prepare his biography. We’ll never see those things again! Nor Cornelius, the rat. I think he’s holed up in a hidden lair somewhere along the chasm wall, south of the Imperial Bridge.”  (a reference to Lucius Cornelius Scriptor’s tomb (6-130 to 6-135). The Bridge referred to is the now-Sundered Span (5-35))
	* 4) Bottle with imprisoned wraith. The wraith will attack (25%) or issue threats before departing to the Tower of Scrutiny (AV-8) (75%). Wraith: SZ M; AL LE; AC 4; MV 120', 240' flying (Class B); HD 5+3; HP 36; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6. Special attacks: energy drain. Special defenses: silver or magic weapons to hit; immune to sleep, charm, hold, cold, poison, and paralysis

	* 6) 3d4 giant centipedes: SZ S; AL N; AC 9; MV 150’; HD 1 or 2 HP; HP 2(x6), 1(x6); #AT 1; Dmg n.a. Special attacks: poison (+4 to save)
* North Tower: 
	* Trackers may notice tracks leading into the rubble-strewn interior; a group of seven humanoids relatively recently.  They lead to a pile of stone blocks concealing a 3’-diameter hole into the rubble.
	* Within is a cleared space about 14’ in diameter but only 3.5’ tall with a firepit and firewood stockpile.  There is a trapdoor leading down into the cellar.
	* The cellar is dry, and holds seven bedrolls and a new, locked, wooden chest.  A 5' tall by 2' wide crack splits one wall.
		* Chest: 3x 50’ coils of rope, climbing pitons, 2x hammers, 15x torches, a broom, and 6x flasks of oil. 3x 2"-diameter bronze medallions showing an Archontean cestus on one side and the initials ‘SF’ in Archontean.
		* The crack leads to a larger natural tunnel descending 350’ to 3-52a.
		* 20% chance that a trip of the Sodality of the Fist is present.
			* They will attempt negotiation for discretion and being left alone. If pressed, they clam up, even enduring torture and interrogation rather than betray their vows. If treated harshly and released, Durdeon and his friends will be implacable enemies.
	* The tower was discovered by Durdeon Vislok, an adventurous young Archontean aristocrat.
		* He ventured down the tunnel to the Arena (6-68), via areas 3-52a (wisely leaving the noise inside the sarcophagi alone, and sneaking through the area on subsequent trips), 5-64, 5-55, 6-3, and 6-58.
		* Inspired by the arena fights he witnessed, he enlisted his louche friends in Narsileon into a secretive organization that he named the Sodality of the Fist.
			* Members must participate in monthly, illicit, cestus fights in or near Narsileon.  Potential recruits are vetted for toughness and ability to keep a secret.
			* Those who prove themselves by winning at least five bouts and earning the trust and confidence of Durdeon and two other members are invited to accompany six members on a trip to the Arena within Arden Vul.  They travel secretly to the ruined city, rest in the cellar, and descend to the Arena.
			* Durdeon dreams of fielding a team of cestus fighters to compete in the Arena.
	* Sodality of the Fist
		* Durdeon Vislok, male Archontean aristocrat and 4th-level fighter/3rd-level thief (20% chance): SZ M; AL LN; AC 7; MV 90’; HD 7; HP 45; #AT 1; Dmg 1-3 (cestus) or 2-7 (short sword +1). Thief skills: PP 40%, OL 38%, F/RT 30%, MS 27%, HS 20%, HN 15%, CW 87%. Possessions: leather armor +1; cestus; short sword +1; purse with 39 pp, 15 gp, a gold signet ring (75 gp), and a bronze medallion of the Sodality of the Fist (10 sp).
		* 6 male Archontean members of the Sodality of the Fist, as 3rd-level fighters (20% chance): SZ M; AL LN; AC 8; MV 90’; HD 3; HP 27, 25, 24, 22, 21, 19; #AT 1; Dmg 1-3 (cestus) or 1-6 (short sword). Possessions: leather armor; short sword; cestus; purse with 2-20 pp, 2-20 gp, and a bronze medallion of the Sodality of the Fist (10 sp).

### AV-13: Eastern Plaza

* A once-pleasant plaza littered with masonry rubble a 15’-diameter dry fountain basin at its 
center.
	* The marble right arm and hand from the colossal statue of Arden (see AV-30) lies in the basin.
	* Trap: the area around the fountain is unstable and will collapse if more than 300 lbs is placed within 5’ of the basin.
		* If it collapses, those standing by the fountain will take 2-12 damage, and will need to be dug out of 10' deep rubble by their friends, taking 1-6 hours. If night falls, the ghouls (AV-11) will certainly investigate. 

### AV-14: Well of Light (w/ access to 2-1, 2-64, and SL-1)

* An obscure path off the Boulevard leading to Eastgate leads to a small courtyard.
	* Standing there is an 5' diameter uncovered well, with a 3’-tall frame.
		* Convex mirrors and shards of glass embedded in the sides of the well reflect light up and down the shaft making the interior very bright.
		* It extends 225’ down to 2-1.
			* 110’ down the shaft is an extremely well hidden secret door (Spot w/ d8 instead of d6 vs 9) leading to the Tombs of Light (SL1-1 includes more info on the secret door).
			* The well does not contain ladder rungs or any other device for negotiating it.
				* Climbing down is optically challenging due to the brightness of the interior.
	* Just east of the well is the 2' stump of a ceramic chimney; it is a 3’x2’ rectangle, and leads down to the refectory at 2-64.

### AV-15: Pyramid of Thoth

* This enormous pyramid, some 90’ square and 45’ high, occupies its own square just north of the Forum.
	* Marble steps rise on each side of the pyramid to a 30' square central platform sheathed in white marble.
	* Above the platform is a stone canopy of dark grey granite, supported by marble and porphyry pillars. Beneath the canopy is the cult statue of Thoth, a 20’-tall ibis-headed person in classic Egyptian pose.

[Pyramid of Thoth](obsidian://open?vault=Arden-Vul%20Keys&file=Arden-Vul%20Ruins%20(AV)%2FPyramid%20of%20Thoth%20(UP)%2FAreas)


## AV 16 - 30

### AV-16: Hidden Stairs to SL4-37

* A rubble-filled cellar just off the Grand Forum (AV-7).
	* The cellar is filled with 5’ of rubble. Clearing the debris reveals a 10’-wide stair leading to a 40’-square sub-basement.
		* Within is an archway to a staircase which twists and turns over numerous landings down 725' to SL4-37.
		* The left arm of the colossal statue of Arden (see AV-30) has been tossed here.

### AV-17: Plaza of the Priests of Thoth (w/ access to 1-1)

* West of the pyramid of Thoth was a complex of buildings used by a small army of priests of Thoth and their servitors.
	* A narrow chimney (1’x1’) pokes out the rubble; leading down to 1-19.
	* The bottom story of a dormitory building (20’ x 30’ x 10’) has escaped flattening.
		* As a secret door, spot the stair leading down 60' to 1-1, hidden by sparse rubble, dust, and dirt.  +2 Spot if you know it's there.
	* Each Turn spent searching the rubble around the Plaza of Thoth (d20):
		* 1-5) Nothing
		* 6-7) 3-12 giant rats: SZ S; AL N(E); AC 7; MV 120’; HD 1-4 HP; HP 4(x3), 3(x3), 2(x3), 1(x3); #At 1; Dmg 1-3. Special attacks: 5% chance of disease
		* 8-9) A nest of wasps

		* A secret door in the cellar wall which opens by sliding a panel to the right, into the wall. Within is a spiral staircase leading down about 225’ to 2-23.

### AV-19: Ruined Palace (w/ access to 3-50A)

* A large, tall mound of rubble.
	* Recent tracks can be spotted (boots, tufts of wool and linen caught on broken masonry, unrusted iron buckles).
	* The rubble conceals a trap door leading to the cellars of this once-grand palace.
* The Cellar
	* 150’ x 60’ with 15’ ceilings, divided into three sub-sections.
	* Entry Room (30’x60’)
		* The trap door enters at the south end.  A score of empty wooden boxes are scattered about (quite recent, with stamps of current victuallers in Narsileon).
		* Eight zombies slouch among the rubble.
			* 8 zombies: SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 14(x3), 12(x4), 11(x3), 10(x3), 9(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special: always strike last.
		* The north wall has an archway concealed behind a stack of boxes.
	* Middle Room (100’x60’)
		* A huge chamber with a score of heavy stone pillars. On the west wall, a ruined staircase once led up into the palace proper.  Ancient debris and trash is scattered everywhere (bits of leather, rotted sacks,  desiccated foodstuffs, wine turned to vinegar, broken tools, etc).
			* Among the trash, is a coil of elven rope.
		* An archway in the south wall leads to the Entry Room.
		* A plaster coat of arms is affixed at the foot of the stairs, a set of fasces and an officer’s baculus tied together with a complex knot.
			* Specific knowledge of the Priscians or a deep historical knowledge can recognize the knot as the one used by the Sortians in antiquity and the Priscians in the present.
			* The coat of arms may be identified by anyone with knowledge of the Archontean nobility as belonging to the Briennios clan, still one of the important mid-rank clans in Archontos.
		* Eight more zombies patrol this hall.
			* 8 zombies: SZ M; AL N; AC 8; MV 60’; HD 2; HP 14(x3), 12(x4), 11(x3), 10(x3), 9(x3); #AT 1; Dmg 1-8. Special: always strike last.
		* Secret Door (north wall): opens by thrusting a 1”-diameter object into a hole in the ceiling (15’ above the floor).
	* Secret Room (20x’20’)
		* A narrow, 5’-wide entrance to a staircase descending 350’ through several landings to 3-50A.
* These ruins were once the palace of the Briennios clan in Arden Vul.
	* The Briennios were and still are an important imperial service clan, one that provides many bureaucrats and officers. At the time of the War of the Sortians and Theosophs, the Briennios were highly placed advisors to the archon of Arden Vul.
	* Lucius Briennios was also an old schoolmate of Macrinus Furiosus, and became a secret supporter of the Sortians. He allowed the Sortians to construct their secret entrance in the cellar of his urban palace.
	* This entrance remained undiscovered for more than a thousand years until Nerub Null (9-64) discovered area 3-50, and the stairs at 3-50a. Nerub Null eventually built the secret entrance in the ruins to allow his allies and badly-needed supplies to enter the dungeons. 
	* They only use the entrance in the dead of night so as to minimize the chance of discovery. The Priscians animated the zombies to guard their secret entrance.

### AV-20: Isadora's Estate (w/ access to SL11-18)

* The ruins of a once-elegant villa in the classic style, just outside the walls of Arden Vul.
	* Owned by the famous Lady Isadora, a known aesthete, artist, philosopher, and hostess of one of the great intellectual and political salons of her age.
	* Built on a grand scale: two atria and a large peristyle along with the usual suites of chambers for Isadora, her guests, her servants, and her extensive collection of art.
	* Half the walls still stand and the roof is gone.  Long ago looted to the rafters.
	* In a chamber off the peristyle are stairs leading to the wine cellar.
		* A rank animal stench permeates the cellar, the lair of a giant wolverine.
			* 1 exceptionally large giant wolverine: SZ M; AL N; AC 4; MV 150’; HD 5+5; HD 42; #AT 3; Dmg 2-5/2-5/2-8. Special attacks: musk; +4 to hit.
		* Sixteen large casks line the walls, wine long evaporated, leaving only a thick precipitate coating the casks.
			* One cask is an illusion.
		* Several skeletons of human adventurers are scattered about the floor of the cellar.
			* 2x suits of slightly damaged chain mail, a long sword, 16x darts, 2x flasks of oil, a scroll of protection from evil, a scroll of locate place, a potion of fire resistance, a potion of hostile levitation, and a purse with a large lump of amber (175 gp) and 113 sp.
	* Illusory Cask
		* Covers a stone wall with 14 glowing gold Archontean letters in a circle: ORCUSAIDSPAIRS (clockwise from the top)
		* An anagram: touched in order to spell “ISADORAPRISCUS” or “PRISCUSISADORA”.
			* Any incorrect combination summons an invisible stalker, bound a millennium ago by Isadora’s Sortian friends.  It attempts to kill all present, but won't pursue out of the cellar. It waits for a month, ready to attack the same party if they return.  Other stalkers will be summoned if the first is slain.
				* 1 invisible stalker: SZ L; AL N; AC 3; MV 120’; HD 8; HP 55; #AT 1; Dmg 4-16; MR 30%. Special attacks: surprise on 1-5. Special defenses: invisibility.
			* The correct code reveals a door to a small chamber with a circular staircase.  The stairs are roughly carved of granite, and boast a rise to run ratio too large for human feet. They descends 150’ to to Isadora’s secret tomb (SL11-18).
	* GM Note: investigating Archontean civil property records for the estate (possible in Narsileon, at the House of Coins) reveals that the estate was owned for 700 years by a succession of women whose names always began with the letter ‘I’: Ianthe, Isabella, Iola, Irene, Isolde, and finally, Isadora. All these women were the same person, namely the gold dragon, Yasidoranicil (see SL11-19) who changed her name to preserve her human identity across the centuries.

### AV-21: Northgate

* Two 30’ towers with new doors, locked with shiny new padlocks.
	* Kronos Kettle-Belly (AV-22) and his team cleared the area around the gate of rubble.
	* Kronos has placed teams of 2 men in the top of each tower to observe activity in the ruins.
		* They have orders to shout at any newcomers to the ruins and invite them to the Broken Head (see below, AV-22).
			* If the PCs seem to be eager to cross the bridge to the donjon (AV-26), they will shout to warn, saying that it leads to certain doom.

		* 4 2nd-level Thorcin fighters: SZ M; AL LN; AC 6; MV 90’; HD 2; HP 18, 17, 16, 15; #AT 1; Dmg 1-6 (bow) or 1-6 (short sword). Possessions: studded leather armor and shield; short swords; short bows; 2-12 sp each. One has a potion of healing.

### AV-22: The Sign of the Broken Head

* A fortified refuge and trading center just beyond the River Gate (AV-23). 
	* Built on the solid foundation of an old outbuilding from scavenged stone blocks and wood beams.
		* Kronos and his men salvaged the colossal head of Arden the Defender from the ruins of the forum (AV-30) and mounted it on a beam above the front door of the Inn.
			* The head is six feet in diameter, with oval, staring eyes (empty of their insets), and is depicted clad in a Corinthian helmet.
			* The head detects as magic (Estelle knows), but seems inert.  If addressed as “Lord Arden” it will animate and whisper “Restore me! Restore me! Courage shall be yours when I am whole and the incantation sung!”
	* A central structure (30’ x 40’ x 25’) with an attached stable (20’ x 20’ x 12’) projecting southeast.
		* Fort-like, with no windows on the stone ground story, and only a few narrow windows set into the wooden second floor.
		* No interior connection to the stable.
	* Several less-fortified outbuildings nearby: a smokehouse, outhouse, kitchen, and two storehouses.

[Sign of the Broken Head](obsidian://open?vault=Arden-Vul%20Keys&file=Arden-Vul%20Ruins%20(AV)%2FSign%20of%20the%20Broken%20Head%20(AV-22)%2FSign%20of%20the%20Broken%20Head)

### AV-23: River Gate

* Two massive (40’-square) towers guard the northern river entry to Arden Vul. They suffered badly when the city was ravaged. 
* West Tower

		* 2x 1’-long silver ankh-keys (one chased with black glass and the other with a white glass).  A copper tablet inscribed (Mithric): “To open the Chamber of the Beacon, all three ankhs must be pressed into the proper locations on the proper monument at midday.”
		* The corpse wears cursed Boots of Attraction.
	* East Tower:
		* East and south sides of this tower are still mostly intact (30’ tall).
			* A steep slope of rubble leads from the ground near the river up to those walls.
			* This rubble pile is pretty secure, so it is relatively easy to climb to the top of the pile and get a nice view of the city.
		* The former south entrance door leads to a 10’x18’ ‘chamber’ under the rubble with a cook-fire, a battered bucket, and a small stack of firewood.
			* Adventurers and hermits occasionally camp here.  25% chance of 3-6 adventurers camping here.

### AV-24: Swift River

* The Swift River rushes through the ruins at a fast clip.
	* The current is too fast to swim in the western / main arm of the river.
	* In the eastern channel, leading to the docks, the current is potentially swim-able.

### AV-25: Shattered Northern Bridge

* A shattered stone bridge with a 15’ gap between its surviving segments. The bridge is extremely fragile.

### AV-26: Bridge to Ruined Donjon

* A slender masonry bridge (8' wide, w/ 1' parapet), still intact after all the centuries.
	* Standing on the bridge lets one see the Outer Bailey (AV-27) clearly, with its bones and stone lumps.
	* Kronos’s men in the towers (AV-21) may shout to warn against the bridge, saying that it leads to certain doom.
* Next to the bridge on the east bank is a small, intact guard-room (10’ square) missing its roof.

### AV-27: Ruined Donjon (w/ access to 6-152 and SL15-4)

* Originally had a curtain wall on the northern and western sides, with three 25’-diameter towers, and a large oblong fortress inside those walls. 
	* The citadel of Arden Vul was mostly destroyed during the assault on the city
	* The curtain wall has been reduced to a 10’-tall line of rubble.
	* Two towers on the walls remain partly intact; the others are shapeless piles of rubble.
* It may be possible to swim the river to the southeast bank (avoiding the outer bailey and imperial stone guardians), and climb the rubble pile to access the donjon from the 2nd floor.
##### Outer Bailey

* Open area north of the curtain wall, relatively clear of masonry debris, near the bridge (AV-26).
* Visible from either bank are 4 large (8’-tall) misshapen lumps of guano-stained stone and a large number bones gleaming in the sun.
	* These are imperial stone guardians, still vigilantly defending the citadel.  If interlopers cross the bridge into the outer bailey, the stone guardians lumber to the attack.

4 imperial stone guardians (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 60, 60, 60, 60; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%. Special defenses: +2 or better weapons to hit; immune to missiles (including magic missile), fire, cold, mind-affecting spells (e.g. charm), and most immobilizing spells (immune to entangle, hold monster, web).

##### Carrion Tower (West Tower)

* Named for the several dozen large black vultures that make it their home.
	* They nest in the top-most surviving level of the tower, entering through a catapult hole on the western side of the tower, by the river.  Their lair is so foul that on a bad day the reek drifts across the river to the western bank.
* Access to the tower was originally achieved from a door to the inner baily, but the collapse of the walls has buried the entrance.
	* The only access is by scaling its outside walls and entering the chamber of the vultures through the catapult hole.
* A stone stair leads connects the floors.
	* 4th Floor: collapsed.
	* 3rd Floor: vulture lair.
		* Save vs. Doom or be weakened (-2 to all rolls) for an hour due to retching. The vultures squawk at intruders, but do not attack.
	* 2nd Floor: empty, save for some skeletons.
	* Ground Floor: an imperial stone guardian.
	* Basement:
		* Four two-handed swords of fine quality and archaic style.
		* A small, dust-covered altar to the gods concerned with war and defense (Sekhmet, Horus, and Ra).  Inserting one of the swords into a hole in the rear base opens the secret door.
		* Secret door leads to a circular staircase descending 1,200’ to 6-152.

1 imperial stone guardian (see new monsters): SZ L; AL N; AC -2; MV 90’; HD 8+3; HP 60; #AT 2; Dmg 3-18/3-18; MR 50%.

##### Ghost Tower (Northwest Tower)

* Known to modern explorers as the Ghost Tower due to the wordless cries and moans of the haunts Poulos and Mekos.
* A four-story tower in almost-pristine condition, complete with conical, slate-covered roof.
	* The inner bailey door to the ground floor is blocked by the partial collapse of the curtain wall; it would take 6 hours of serious digging to clear the rubble.
	* Can be access via the five 10’-wide windows that in the top story.
* * A stone stair leads connects the floors.
	* Fourth Floor: charred ruins of ballistae, half a barrel of still-usable flammable oil (15x flasks).
	* Third Floor: a barracks, destroyed cots, chests, and equipment; six ancient skeletons.
	* Second Floor: half-collapsed.  The other half contains three desks.
		* Among the drawers are some blank archonal rescripts, with the ‘signature’ of Uriel Basileon (see AV-29). The rescripts could be used to impersonate imperial authority, provided the forger can imitate imperial court hand.
	* First Floor: the door to the inner bailey to the ground floor is blocked by rubble.
	* Basement: armory with 40 spears, 20 gladii, 20 medium iron shields, 5 grappling hooks, 20 crossbows, and 360 crossbow bolts. A 10' x 10' trap door leads to the sub-basement (SL15-4).
* The Ghosts
	* Two late Archontean-era dekarchs, Poulos Tissel and Mekos Gadril, haunt the entire tower as vengeful spirits.
		* One spirit is always found in the Ghost Tower proper, while the other is found in the sub-basement (SL15-4).
		* The pair seek vengeance for their murder; finding their bones in the sub-basement and giving them proper burial puts the spirits to rest.

Poulos Tissel and Mekos Gadril, vengeful spirits: SZ M; AL LE; AC 1; MV 120’; HD 6; HP 41, 36; #AT 1; Dmg 1-12; MR 25%. Special attacks: STR drain. Special defenses: +1 or better weapons to hit; immune to fire; turned as vampires; reform in 1-6 hours if their bones remain unburied.
##### Inner Bailey

* Open space between the curtain walls and the donjon, featuring nothing but cracked and buckled pavement and a variety of scorched and ruined pieces of armor.

##### Donjon

* This impressive fortification once loomed 40’ over the river that surrounds it.
	* The thick walls were mostly solid, with only an occasional arrow slit for light (and defense).
	* It used to contain a ground floor (storage, forage, stables), a first floor (great hall and a few solars), a second floor (barracks, armory, kitchen, jakes), a third floor (command rooms, private chambers, wizard’s lab, etc.), a machicolated roof, and extensive cellars.
* At present the donjon is in a bad state of disrepair.
	* The front doors (to the inner bailey) have been blasted off (signs of charring, but the doors are absent) and the roof has collapsed, burying most of the third floor.
	* The northeast wall (badly damaged in the assault), has collapsed, leaving a large ramp of masonry from ground (great hall) to the second floor.
* One corner of the cellar contains a [Thothian teleportation ring](obsidian://open?vault=Arden-Vul%20Keys&file=_Notes_%2FThothian%20Teleportation%20Rings) (address: GR-RE-YE-BL-BK-WH), with no activation squares present.

### AV-28: Obelisk of the Moon

* A walled (8') verdant-gone-wild, secluded garden in the northeast corner of the archon's palace.
	* Inside is the 10' tall stump of the Obelisk of the Moon.  What remains matches the Obelisk of the Sun (AV-5) except with lunar images.
		* Unless elevated, it's hard to spot the truncated obelisk from afar.
	* Double doors at the south end lead to the Solarium in the palace (AV-29).

### AV-29: Palace Ruins

* The northern end of the island was the site of the palace of the imperial archon (governor) of the city.
	* It spanned an area of roughly 75’ x 130’ and was four stories tall, with three domes rising above the roof (two 25’-diameter domes flanked a central 35’-diameter dome).
	* Much of the complex, and in particular the western and central portions of it (holding sumptuous apartments, meeting rooms, libraries, dining facilities, etc.), lie in ruins.
		* This rubble can be searched for the usual PCG chance of discovery.
	* The eastern wing seems in better shape, and that the eastern dome is still intact.
	* The 15’-tall ebony double-doors of the main entrance are also still intact (wizard locked, 12th-level).
		* If the doors are touched, a magic mouth sternly declaims (Mithric), “Stand back, citizen. This is not your home!”.
		* Beyond is a carpeted antechamber with two wooden settees and three doors leading to the separate wings of the palace.
			* Two desiccated bodies of servants who starved to death.
			* The north and west doors lead to collapsed areas.  The eastern door (wizard-locked, 12th-level) leads to the eastern wing.
* Eastern Wing
	* The door from the antechamber leads east past several storerooms, a stairwell filled with rubble from the upper floors, and a sitting room.  At the end, the domed imperial solarium.

			* The area is damp and humid; the floor is slick with spray from the fountain.
			* Pair of double-doors are on the west (palace) and north (to AV-28) walls.
		* Balconies dot the vertical faces of the solarium; these feature planters of various size and shape, which still hold an exotic mixture of flora.
			* The royal balcony stands 2/3 of the way up the western side of the chamber.
			* Short bridges link balconies, describing arcs along the sides of the chamber, but not across the middle.
		* A 15’-diameter basin and fountain stands at the center of the ground floor.
			* Magical jets of water periodically spray out to water the balconies.
		* Plant life has flourished over the millennia.
			* Vines, orchids, small shrubs, an old but stunted elm tree grow on or hang from the various balconies.
			* Amid the plant life is a shambling mound.
		* Royal Balcony
			* On a settee, hidden amid the riot of plant life is the body of the last imperial governor, Uriel Basileon, where she committed ritual suicide as the city fell.

* Note: The governor’s palace is a destination for the one-way teleport pillar at 4-167.
	* Since the destination floor has collapsed, those teleported here find themselves falling through the air for 10’ before landing on the rubble (1d6 damage).
	* Surprised travelers might, however, glimpse the stump of the Obelisk of the Moon (AV-28) as they fall.

* This lagoon was the main docking facility for Arden Vu and the start of a tow-way along the east side of the river by which boats could be towed upstream until they could sail on their own steam.
	* The cement docks extend into the lagoon, pitted, bowed.  At least one near collapse from erosion. 
	* Resting on the river bottom amid the docks is the marble torso of the colossal statue of Arden (see AV-30).

	* It is pitted with age, but still sound.

### AV-34: Hidden Doors to the Chamber of the Beacon (SL14-1)

* In the pavement of a plaza, buried beneath several layers of rubble are steel doors.
	* The doors will open downward in a shower of rubble if the three Obelisks are activated.

### AV-35: The Tranquil Lake

* The Archonteans dammed the Swift River to form the "Tranquil Lake", 50' deep in places.
	* With the spillway unmonitored, the lake has grown substantially, creating a swamp (AV-38) on the west and south sides (~10' deep or less).
	* The waters are cloudy with silt and dotted with lily pads and reeds.
	* A number of large crocodiles make their home in the lake.
		* 15 crocodiles: SZ L; AL N; AC 5; MV 60’, 120’ swimming; HD 3; HP 24, 22, 22, 20, 19(x3), 18(x3), 17(x3), 16, 15; #AT 2; Dmg 2-8/1-12. Special attacks: surprise on 1-3.
##### AV-35a: Dam and Spillway

* The dam is made of stone blocks fused together by magic.  It possesses an adamantine spillway control system.
	* There is a locked (and stuck) door on the east side of the dam, leading to a 10’x10’ room containing 2 great adamantine wheels.
		* The left wheel no longer works and spins easily on its shaft.
		* The right wheel is stuck (open doors to unstick) but still operative, and can be used to raise or lower the water-flow mechanism on top of the dam.
			* Counter-clockwise raises the water-flow mechanism; clockwise lowers it.
			* There are 10 ‘stops’, from stop 1 (fully raised) to stop 10 (fully lowered).
			* Anyone turning the wheel feels when the wheel ‘clicks’ into a new stop, and they will hear some grinding of gears and, potentially, more or less sound from the waterfall.
			* (Current Position) the wheel is set at stop 4 (three stops available for raising the water-flow mechanism, but six available stops for lowering it. 
	* Each change of stop changes the lake level by 4", takes effect over 1d3 days, and causes the extent of the swamp to increase or retreat by 25'.
		* Fully raising the mechanism will still allow some water to escape through the spillway, but the volume of the waterfall will visibly diminish.  This will also bring the swamp directly to the entrance to Craastonistorex’s tower, which the dragon will not appreciate.
		* Fully lowering the mechanism, will greatly increase the volume and violence of the waterfall, will improve the visibility of the lake-water (allowing a glimpse of the sunken pleasure barge, AV-35), and will mostly drain the swamp (permitting access to AV-39, among other things). Draining the swamp will also incur the dragon’s wrath.
##### AV-35b: Sunken Pleasure Barge

* A sunken pleasure barge (marked B on the map) lies 30' below the surface.
		* Home to an enormous snapping turtle.
			* 1 giant snapping turtle: SZ L; AL N; AC 5 (0); MV 30’, 20’ swimming; HD 10; HP 71; #AT 1; Dmg 6-24. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4.
		* Inside are two rotted treasure chests:
			* Chest of coins: 4,000 ancient silver pennies and 1,250 ancient gold solidi.
			* Chest of goods: 5 golden medallions (45 gp each, more to a collector); 3x silver ankh-keys; a gold key to the Obsidian Gates (5-6d); 1d4 more keys (GM’s choice); Trollsbane (a magical broadsword); and a Wand of Paralyzation (47 charges).

X / 71

### AV-36: Corroded Southern Bridges

* Two corroded and obviously unsafe iron bridges that span the river south of the dam.

### AV-37: Partly Intact Structures (Generic)

* Several different of the best-preserved remaining structures.
	* 2-in-10 chance per hour for something special (Exploration PCG) when exploring one of these ruins (max 2 finds from each location).

### AV-38: Swamp

* The southwest quadrant of the city became a swamp when the spillway system fell into desuetude.
	* The area echoes with a range of sounds, from the shrill piping of the peepers to the deep and intimidating roar of the giant frogs.
	* Flooded with 2’ of sludgy dirty water, slowing movement.
		* Every Turn of movement, there is a 1-in-6 chance for a lead PC to slip into a hole in the pavement and become drenched.
	* Every hour, 1-in-6 chance of attracting the attention of 4-6 fearless and always-hungry giant frogs. 
		* 24 giant frogs, appearing in groups of 4-6: SZ M; AL N; AC 7; MV 30’, 90’ swimming, 100’ jumping; HD 2; HP 16, 15, 13, 12, 11, 9; #AT 1; Dmg 2-8. Special attacks: surprise on 1-4; tongue strikes at +4 to hit; swallow on natural 20.
* The area is slightly less dilapidated than the rest of the city.
	* For those who stop to explore the occasional shell of a building or push a foot or pole into a ruined foundation, the chance of an interesting encounter rises by 1.
* Affecting or Draining the Swamp
	* Manipulating the spillway mechanism (AV-35a) can reduce the radius of the swamp by 100 feet, and the standing water to no more than a few inches in low-lying areas.
	* Opening the door at AV-39 will drain the southern portion of the swamp and affect portions of Level 4 (see AV-39).

### AV-39: Soggy Stairs (w/ access to 4-122a)

* The ruins of a large imperial administrative building, swallowed by the swamp.
	* A water-filled cellar (4’ deep) hides a stairwell leading down 20’ to locked iron door.
		* If the swamp is drained via the spillway at AV-35a, the stairwell becomes visible, though still filled with water.
		* If picked and opened, it leads to a sub-basement, with further stairs descending 650’ to 4-122a.
* Effects of Opening the Door
	* If opened without draining the swamp, 110,000 cubic feet of murky swamp water rushes towards Level 4. Anyone in the stairwell is swept away, taking 20d6 damage and must save vs Doom at -2 or drown.
	* The effects of this sudden drainage:
		* The Swamp: the southern half of the swamp (approximately 22 squares) will drain almost completely (although pockets of water in basements remain).
		* 4-121 (the chasm of Set): half of the released swamp water (55,000 cubic feet) will rush into this chasm, raising the water level in the chasm by 55’ such that the bridge (4-120A) is only 30’ above the new level.
		* Path of the Water to the South on Level 4: the other half of the swamp water will rush south, passing through 4-122, 4-170, 4-172, 4-178, 4-189 and 4-190 before pouring messily out of the cliff onto the valley below. Anyone standing in the route of the water will be swept away to their demise.
			* 4-170: the portable statues of Set are swept away and destroyed. They will be replaced in 1-4 months.
			* 4-172: all the sand on the floor of the cavern is swept away, and the colossal heads will be shifted to partially block the passage towards 4-178. The passage will be blocked for 4-7 days until the Set cult can lever the heads out of the way.
			* 4-178: the dungeoneering equipment on top of the boulder is swept away.
			* 4-189: the impaled, animated skeletons are swept away and destroyed. These will not be replaced.
			* 4-90: the Set cult’s pulley and basket apparatus will be swept away and lost. It will take the cult 3-7 weeks to re-establish.

### AV-40: Tower of the Wyrm

* A tower slightly larger than normal (40’ in diameter) and in good shape.
	* The scent of predator musk and heady poison gas exudes from the tower.

Goals
* Has the beginnings of a fair hoard, pillaging what he can find and stealing what he can take.
* Canny and inquisitive, he uses his fear aura to interogate sentient creatures in the area.
* He'll learn of the PCs arrival within 2 days, and will watch the characters for another couple of days before introducing himself, choosing an advantageous time and place (e.g., when a wounded party is exiting the halls)for a dramatic appearance.
	* Speaking politely but firmly, and likely pursues one of the following strategies: 1) if the PCs are powerful, simply warn them not to interfere in his hunting; 2)  magnanimously allow them to carry away whatever spoils they can find in the dungeons with a 50% tithe; 3) bully the PCs into serving him, perhaps eliminating a rival or by locating a particular object.
* He will make occasional reappearances so as to keep the PCs on their toes.

Relations with others:
* Tufwillig: aware of a ‘force of nature’ in the area, but not Tuftwillig specifically. If aware, he will plot Tuftwillig’s demise.
* Kronos Kettle-Belly and Estelle (AV-22): They entrepreneurs act with respect towards him,  providing a weekly offering of game to the dragon.  Unknown to Kronos, Estelle has also been providing curative and information services in lieu of a monetary tribute.
	* Each month there is a 10% cumulative chance, however, that Craastonistorex begins to demand the more traditional tribute.
* Galeth, Master of the Long House (AV-43): a bit intimidated by Galeth’s evil and age, and avoids him. In the right circumstances, the wyrm might trade information about Galeth in return for valuables.
* The Cult of Set: Stephania the high priestess (4-51) pays a tribute of 100 sp per month to ensure that her minions remain unmolested.  As Craastonistorex grows older, he will wish to change the terms of this bargain in his favor.
	* He knows who the cultists at AV-44 are, having tortured and eaten several.
* Deino and the Beastmen: he has only heard of Deino.  She recently refused to pay tribute, and he now hunts the beastmen when he can find them.
* Lizardmen: rarely venture to the top of the cliff, and always offer small, but symbolic, gifts to the wyrm.  Craastonistorex mostly ignores them.
* Trollkin (EX-5): they are terrified of the wyrm but, as they have little treasure, Craastonistorex mostly ignores them. If pressed he will confess that they taste ‘a little off.’
* Knights of the Azure Shield: perceived to be his greatest threat.  He might try to persuade PCs of the knights’ ‘untrustworthiness’ and of the danger they pose ‘to equilibrium in the valley’. He might ally to oppose the knights (leaving the hard work to the PCs). Those publicly allied with the knights, find him to be a permanent and implacable foe.
