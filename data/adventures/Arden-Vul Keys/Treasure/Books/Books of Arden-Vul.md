##### The Adrieniad

* A unique epic poem composed by the short-lived archon of Arden Vul. The verse is quite good, even if the content shows insufferable vanity, for the hero is Adrienic himself; the story involves his rise through the imperial court and his winning of the commission to re-take Arden Vul; it dwells at length on the ease with which the expedition seized the pyramid of Thoth, built a new guard tower at the foot of the falls (EX-4), cleared the Boulevard of Knowledge and Grand Forum (AV-6 and AV-7), and established a HQ near the sundered span (5-35). The poem is not complete, and ends with the confident decision to re-subjugate the Arden Vul ‘trolls’ to the Emperor’s authority.

##### Allies for Ever!: A glossy, 120-minute production detailing the 
history of the rudishva and kaliyani peoples and their momentous 
meeting among the stars, a meeting which led to the formation 
of the “Glorious Star-Borne Hegemony.” The backdrops are all 
futuristic and alien, with strange colors, devices, and many talking-
head shots of rudishva and kaliyani scholars. (A unknown; L

##### Anatomy of the Enemy: A rudishva training manual that ex-
plains the biological abilities of the heqeti (with ample images of 
dissection), as well as their offensive and defensive capabilities. 
Provides a viewer with full understanding of the basic combat 
abilities of all types of heqeti and a +1 to hit and damage against 
them. (A unknown; L Rudishva; T data crystal; D 2” long x 3/4”

##### The Ancient Ones: Composed by one of the chief lieutenants 
of the archon, Irene Bellatrix (c. AEP 1070), this text describes 
the mysterious ancient beings known to the Archonteans as the 
‘Survivors of the Old War’, but self-described as ‘Rudishva’ and as 
‘the Beacon’s children’. The overview describes the Ancient Ones 
as immortal, tall and skinny, with slightly demonic visage, long 
slender fingers, and a marvelous ability to create and use magical 
items. Despite this obvious affinity for magic items, they do not 
appear to cast spells, at least any known to the Order of Thoth. 
They eat, but sparingly, and prefer vegetarian fare. Some have 
taken up residence with the Archonteans, and have offered their 
skills. They claim not to be able to manipulate the Obsidian Gates. 
Laelius describes each of these survivors in turn:
 Crallicarus: Always grinning, always attempting jokes. Ap-
pears to be an entertainer, but a highly disciplined and highly 
organized one. GM Note: Laelius refers to Crellik-Var, now the 
Lord of the Arena in 6-85.
 Salorikus: A gifted surgeon, learned in anatomy and capable 
of the most impressive medical procedures. Highly valued by the 
archon for his excellent service. GM Note: The author is referring 
to Psalor-Ki, now in 5-74.
 Ravatorus: A sage of sorts, with deep knowledge of subter-
ranean and piscine life forms. Has offered assistance in identifying 
rare creatures and helping determine their abilities. GM Note: 
Laelius refers to Reiv-Tor, now found in SL7-23.
 Melacorius: A great general of the rudishva. Rarely seen by the 
Archonteans, only visiting on occasion from an unknown redoubt 
hidden by sorcery. Polite, educated, fluent in Archontean, with 
immense charisma. GM Note: Laelius is referring to Melok-Ri, or 
Master Malachite area SL10-32.
 Isocrates: The companion of Melacorius; silent, brooding, un-
pleasant. Apparently a soldier, for he always comes with a large 
sword. GM Note: Laelius refers to Isok-Crix, now found in area 
6-20.
 Nacalorus: Humble, self-abasing, with few skills save language. 
Has aided the temples in teaching a spoken form of Rudishva. Ap-
parently a servant to the greater lords. GM Note: The author refers 
to Naik-Lir, now an intelligent giant rudishva skeleton at SL7-13.

##### Animating the Inanimate: The most significant ancient Archon-
tean work on the principles and practice of creating constructs. 
Vaslotus provides 75% of the necessary information for creating 
imperial stone guardians (see new monsters), as well as full 
guidelines on how to animate stone statues. One of two copies of 
this work was stolen from the Imperial Academy by Kerbog Khan.

##### Archons of Arden Vul: A text that lists most of the archons, from 
the first, Fretevus of Haldor (r. AEP 893-902), to one of the last, 
Ismil the Coward (AEP 1783-1790). It provides a brief summary 
of the reign of each. (A anonymous; L Mithric; T 4 scrolls; D

Location: 8-125, 9-107, SL6-17A.

##### Arden Speaks: A beautiful volume that collects alleged sayings 
by the great Arden. Each folio gets a different saying, which is 
accompanied by a moralizing gloss by the author. The tenor of 
Arden’s epigrams is positive, serving to emphasize imperial virtues 
of hard work, loyalty, obedience, and respect for proper authority.

##### The Art of Becoming: This valuable work details the process of 
construction of imperial stone guardians (see new monsters). 
The process is widely considered lost, so this manuscript would 
be nearly priceless to imperial officials. Depending on how it was 
deployed, it might even alter power structures throughout the 
empire. This copy is highly annotated with speculative questions 
about various rudishva constructs (see new monsters); while the 
annotations are learned, they provide no special insight into how 
to create or destroy such constructs.
 Varix’s tome reveals that the process for creating an imperial 
stone guardian is complex, costly, and lengthy. A magic user of at 
least 14th level must expend 1,000 gp per HP (minimum 50,000 
gp) and spend two months creating the guardian. The wizard 
must also employ special concrete, into which has been mixed 
a dram of blood from an Archontean citizen and the ground-up 
bones of an Archontean soldier who fell defending the empire 
from attacking foes. The magic user must also cast limited wish, 
polymorph any object, geas, and protection from normal missiles.

##### Be the Best Scout You Can Be!: A 22-minute training video used 
to help new varuda recruits learn their role in the rudishva mil-
itary structure. The video emphasizes stealth and observation, 
emphasizing how the unique gliding skills of the varuda can be 
enhanced by technological advances. The narrator is a shorts-and-
tunic wearing varuda named Heert. The GM might decide that a 
thief could gain +5% to his/her Move Silently skills by watching 
this video. (A Heert; L Varuda; T data crystal; D 2” long x 3/4” in

##### Best Aerial Vacations in Hegemony Space: A breathtaking, two-
hour tour of nine of the most popular vacation destinations for 
varuda tourists. These destinations all involve gliding via thermals 
through spectacular, if alien, landscapes. For those with vertigo, 
the experience can be nausea-inducing. The production is narrated 
by a breathless varuda whose excitement becomes palpable (with 
chirps and squeaks) as the action becomes aerial. (A anonymous; L

P. Value: 2,000 Location: 5-111.

##### The Betrayal: A short, hastily scribed, and slightly bitter account 
of the treason of a certain Lisstak, chief of the kaliyani, against the 
rudishva. The account claims that, after ‘our victory,’ Lisstak grew 
bored with peace. Lisstak began to use honeyed words to twist the 
minds of the kaliyani, causing them to envy the varumani and the 
varuda. Lisstak’s counsel grew contentious, and it angered Leil-Jor, 
who commanded obedience. Lisstak refused and departed, with 
the majority of the kaliyani. Lisstak sought out the remnant of 
the ‘old enemy’, and traded secrets of the masters for protection. 
Finally, the scroll alleges that it was through Lisstak that the 
‘sickness’ arrived. (A anonymous; L Rudishva; T scroll; D 1x10x1;

##### Beyond the Veil: Interviews with the Elementals: An obscure 
text by the bizarre Khumus elementalist, Kagni-na-Phen, which 
purports to record a series of interviews with named elementals 
from each of the elemental planes. The names of these elementals 
are, of course, extremely valuable. The rest of the text is opaque, 
and drifts between Khumus, elemental languages, and an 
apparently invented tongue created by the author. What is clear is 
that the text provides practical advice on the dangers and proper 
techniques for summoning elementals, with descriptions of their 
powers. (A Kagni-na-Phen; L Khumus; T codex; D 5x7x3; W 12

##### Biological Systems: An Owner’s Manual: A lengthy (6 hour) 
description of the anatomy and basic biology of each of the four 
star-faring races found on the Beacon: the rudishva, the varumani, 
the varuda, and the kaliyani. A viewer with 18 INT might be able to 
glean a slight advantage in combat (+1 to hit) against varumani or 
kaliyani by reading it. (A anonymous; L Rudishva; T data crystal; 
D 2” long x 3/4” in diameter; W negligible; M plastic; R very rare; 
FoS humanoids and giantkind; SKC biology) Experience Point

##### Blood is the Key to All: This unique and blasphemous work was 
considered the basic text for the principles of blood magic, that is, 
the way to use blood as a focus for spell casting. The sole known 
copy was held in the Imperial Academy before it was stolen by 
Cerbactos Kalthetos (aka Kerbog Khan, see SL12-25). The identity 
of the author is a minor mystery among the score or so mages who 
even know of the existence of this volume; all that they agree upon 
is that he lived prior to the war of the Sortians and Theosophs. In 
fact, the author was Psalor-Ki (5-74), who retains the autograph 
manuscript in his sanctum. (A the Sanguinator; L Mithric; T

##### Book of Night Maneuvers: This rare volume was widely condemn-
ed in its day. It describes procedures for all manner of burglary, 
house-breaking, and second-story work. It also includes an ap-
pendix that describes eight famous heists conducted during the 
Golden Age of the Archontean Empire, with speculation on where 
the stolen objects ended up. In essence, it provides eight treasure 
maps. (A Tetrus Beloved-of-Jael; L Mithric; T codex; D 4x6x5; W

##### Book of Priors: This volume was begun in 937 AEP by Gaius 
Probus, prior of the temple of Thoth, and provides an annalistic 
record of the city of Arden Vul from the founding in 864 AEP The 
first 20 years of Gaius’s account are fairly general, mostly listing 
various series of clerical and secular functionaries; starting in 866, 
however, the volume provides an invaluable, first-hand record of 
the great years of Archontean expansion, with detailed descriptions 
of the chasm, the main levels of the Halls, the heqeti, and the wars 
begun by archons against the hoppers. A reader of this section will 
gain full knowledge of the basic location of all worked, inter-level 
transitions (e.g., 3-55, 5-63).
 Five more recensions have been added to the volume by 
later, unnamed priors. The second recension covers the years 
1145-1190 AEP, namely the first inter-dynastic period and the 
restoration by Marcion IV. The third covers the years 1203-1210, 
and focuses mostly on art. The fourth treats the period from 1397 
to 1499, with a focus on the glorious shift in imperial dynasty to 
Basil II Piso; this section has three folios describing the breaking 
of the ‘ancient compact’ (the Compact of Ennius - see World of 
Archontos appendix). The fifth covers the years 1633-1698, which 
describes the hardening of positions between the old temples and 
the Sortians, and the start of the great civil war. The final recension 
describes the terrible events of 1770 to 1782 AEP, with doom 
looming for Arden Vul (indeed, the city was sacked in 1783). 
These later sections provide extremely valuable history lessons 
to the reader. (A Gaius Probus and others; L Mithric; T codex; D

##### The Book of Thoth: This enormous codex cannot be removed 
from the Shrine of Thoth. In it may be found an incredible trove 
of information, recorded by postulants over many centuries. The 
rules for consulting the volume are rigid, however; for them, see 
SL2-1C. (A anonymous; L Mithric; T codex; D 36x60x24; W 23

A Canticle of Arcane Knowledge: An important text by one of the 
great Sortians, Priscus Pulcher, that outlines his theories of magic. 
Chief among these is the concept that talent for magic is a spark 
equally distributed throughout the population. The text was widely 
condemned and burned in its day. As a result, few copies remain. 
While the principles Priscus espoused are now normative, the 
revelation that Priscus Pulcher, usually seen as a villain, espoused 
these ideas would cause a minor shock throughout the empire. (A

Location: 4-55, 8-125.

##### Canticle of Revelation: One of the main liturgies of the ancient 
cult of Thoth, it enjoins the recitation of a complex set of Thothian 
precepts followed by poems and chants celebrating Thoth’s role in 
revealing language, magic, and knowledge to humans. (A Berenice 
the Chanter; L Mithric; T codex; D 8x12x4; W 5 lb; M white and

Location: 2-70, 3-57.

##### The Case for Action. A 60-minute recording without special effects 
and narrated in the Kaliyani tongue by a grim-looking kaliyani. 
The recording serves as a justification for the kaliyani revolt by 
outlining the grievances of the kaliyani crew in the years after the 
crash of the Beacon. Examples include: a general sense of being 
treated as second-class members of the hegemony; the promotion 
of rudishva ahead of better-qualified kaliyani; the unfair fecundity 
of the varumani and varuda, which caused their numbers and 
influence to surpass that of the kaliyani; unequal access to essential 
items of technology, including power supplies; and a sense that the 
rudishva took credit for kaliyani discoveries and achievements, 
including the discovery of the many uses of arcanum (see new 
magic items). (A Jevereel; L Kaliyani; T data crystal; D 2” long x

##### Codex Legionariorum: This volume provides a complete manual 
of arms for Archontean legionary drills and tactics - at least as 
practiced 1,600 years ago. It also contains an extended epilogue 
on the use of spears. Should a fighter (or paladin or ranger) spend 
a month studying this volume, he/she would gain proficiency in 
spears and enough experience to rise to the next level (or 40,000 
XP, whichever is less). (A Hintorex the dekarch; L Mithric; T codex;

40,000 Location: SL15-7.

##### Codex Priscii: A rare text written by one of the Sortian leaders 
shortly after the end of the War of Sortians and Theosophs, this 
volume provides a laudatory biography of Priscus Pulcher. In 
glowing terms, it describes Priscus’s egalitarian outlook and his 
efforts to find and train as magic users those members of the lower 
orders of Archontean society in whom he glimpsed the arcane 
spark. The last folios contain a copy of Priscus’s spell, friend of the 
Hekate (see new spells). (A Naelor Geisteon; L Mithric; T codex;

##### Codex Sequentis: This 90-folio, unique volume acts as an instruc-
tion manual of sorts for operation of the thaumaturgic circle found 
in area SL14-15. Touching the silver plaques inset on the pillars of 
SL14-4 activates the thaumaturgic circle, and this codex provides 
some of the possible ‘addresses’ for the circle. The first folio lists 
the title and author of the codex. Forty of the ninety folios that 
follow have on the recto a line of squares, neatly painted in silver 
leaf; on top of each square is a Mithric numeral in black ink. On 
the verso of each folio are notes which describe the effect produced 
by touching the pillars in the pattern described on the recto. The 
descriptions for the first six folios concern manipulation of some 
features of the thaumaturgic circle (SL4-15). Beginning with folio 
7, and running through folio 40, the verso leaves describe not 
a magical process but an unusual creature or a distant location; 
these notes frequently offer phenotypical pointers and, sometimes, 
a carefully spelled name. The following table lists the contents of 
folios 1-13.

##### A Complete Decoding of the Old Ones’ Glyphs: This codex of 
200 folios assembles pictures of every known rudishva glyph 
and provides a short sentence or two of Mithric translation and 
explanation. Herodian, called ‘tiro’ because of his youth, was a 
star pupil of the famed Laelius the Praetor; sadly, Herodian was 
assassinated by a jealous husband before he could produce any 
other works of scholarship. (A Herodian Tiro; L Mithric and

##### Creating D-3He Reactions from Native Minerals: This 25 minute 
recording is science-dense, describing a process by which a 
reaction yielding high levels of energy (deuterium-helium3) can 
be achieved from the proper manipulation of a number of rare 
minerals obtained from the strange mud-flats of Sub-Level 9. 
Most readers will find this to be undecipherable gibberish, even if 
they understand the rudishva language. Only those with a proper 
understanding of advanced science will be able to understand that 
this is a genius breakthrough. The deuterium was needed for the 
new propulsion formula devised by hegemony chemical engineers 
to power the remaining shuttle of the Beacon (see areas SL13-37B 
and 9-94). Those able to comprehend advanced science could use 
the process described here to create deuterium, provided they 
had access to a hi-tech laboratory. (A Spiv-Kol; L Rudishva; T

##### Crew Roster: A five-hour production that lists and describes every 
initial crew member of the Beacon. Originally the crew consisted 
of 200 rudishva, 75 kaliyani, 100 varuda, and 75 varumani. Each 
individual is depicted in 3D images, with voice-over describing 
their rank and station, psychological attributes, and posting

##### Deeds of the Azure Knights: An account of the appearance of the 
first known Azure Knight, Reccared Grey-Eyes, in the Archontean 
Empire. The author provides a largely mythological account of 
Reccared’s early years before turning to a more reliable account of 
the valuable assistance he rendered to the Empire, first negotiating 
peace terms with the varumani troll-thegn during the Archontean 
retreat, and then in helping to maintain public order during the 
War of the Sortians and Theosophs. (A Juliana the Prior; L Mithric;

military archon, Marius Tricotor. It describes Marius Tricotor’s 
arrival in Arden Vul as archon and his careful strategic planning; 
it lauds his common touch, including his decision to live among 
and in the style of the ordinary legionaries; it praises his rejection 
of every form of ‘gift’ offered by the great temples; it records the 
laments of his servants at his unwillingness to wear formal court 
attire; it notes his possession of the four artifacts of the archons; 
and, at length, it describes his campaigns through the lower halls 
against the ‘amphibians’.
 Anyone who carefully reads the text gains general information 
about the functions of the surviving buildings in the ruined city, 
and some relational directions about Level 3 (areas 3-1 to 3-162), 
Level 4 (areas 4-1 to 4-122), and Level 6 (areas 6-1 to 6-18, and 
areas 6-53 to 6-92). Lucius Cornelius’s work appeared in several 
forms, as a codex and also as a set of scrolls. (A Lucius Cornelius

##### Deeds of Phagtro the Westron: Phagtro was an ancient Thorcin 
warrior famed for his heroic martial exploits. Like Larel One-Eye, 
many stories are told of Phagtro, and the boundaries between 
‘reality’ and legend are fairly blurry. Typically one encounters a 
single quire recounting one of Phagtro’s many supposed deeds. In 
rare cases, a codex might be encountered in which many of the 
deeds are gathered together. The GM can make up his own ‘tale of 
Phagtro’, or roll on the following chart for sample quires: 

D8 Title Description

Floating Castle Assault on a sorcerous floating castle
2 Phagtro and the

Tales of Phagtro were extremely popular among the Archonteans, 
despite (or because of?) his ‘barbaric’ and unsophisticated ways. 
Phagtro was a real figure, however, and his burial mound can 
be found within the Thicket in Burdock’s Valley (see World of 
Archontos appendix for both). (A anonymous; L Mithric; T quire;

##### Deeds of Ptarmis: An obsequious biography, this manuscript was 
never widely disseminated and today exists only in fragments. It 
describes the efforts of the priest of Thoth, Ptarmis, to study and 
preserve the vast mushroom groves located underneath Arden Vul 
(3-163 and 3-172). The unnamed author paints Ptarmis as a saintly, 
almost druidic figure. The extant fragment of this text does include 
the following tidbit, which might aid those seeking to discover 
the resting place of Ptarmis (3-174): the ‘great fungal explorer, 
Lord Ptarmis, chose to abandon his kith and kin and establish his 
home – and ultimate resting place – on a high promontory amid the 
mushrooms that he loved.’ (A anonymous; L Mithric; T a single quire

Description of the Inn of the Lost: This bifolium records an anon-
ymous visitor’s perceptions of the location known as the Inn of 
the Lost (see areas 6-7 to 6-20). It reads as follows: “The House of 
Iscorax is most pleasant. The proprietor, a certain Thegan White-
Mane, is attentive and accommodating. He has hidden facets, as 
we discovered one night when, uncharacteristically, he joined us in 
the common room for several mugs of ale. He displayed a surprising 
interest in ancient military history and tactics, and was well versed 
in the kinds of things that make our comrade Gister’s eyes glaze 
over. Thegan seemed embarrassed on the morrow, and upgraded 
us to a better class of room; we were all surprised, as who doesn’t 
occasionally require a few tankards to let the steam loose? The next 
morning Gister was gone, and the sacristan fellow recalled seeing him 
departing hurriedly through the peace door on his way to the Troll 
Lift. We are disappointed, but Gister was an odd one. He certainly 
….” [breaks off]. The fragment also describes a route to the Inn 
from 3-1: 3-1 to 3-7, to 5-44A, to 5-48, to 5-35, to 5-55, to 6-3. 
GM Note: this diary entry provides information about areas 6-7 to

a member of the 3rd Cohort) and his current nefarious activities.

##### Diary of Pliv-Mol, Chief of Security. An episodic recording of 
journal entries. They commence with confidence and optimism 
about the ‘harmonious work ethic’ of the ‘star-born hegemony’ 
during the post-crash period of hardship. It notes with satisfaction 
their relatively easy conquest of the indigenous amphibian-oid 
populations, the relative safety offered by their subterranean 
location, and their optimism at the engineers’ promises to fix the 
Beacon. Later entries describe the strategic breeding programs for 
varuda and varumani and further efforts to engineer replacement 
parts for the Beacon, especially using the ‘orange rock that so 
fascinates our fellow-hegemons, the kaliyani’.
 Gradually, over many entries occupying more than four 
hours of time, the entries become shorter, more pessimistic, and 
despairing. The final entry contains clear evidence that Pliv-
Mol suspected Lisstak, the kaliyani leader, of plotting imminent 
treason. Pliv-Mol closes by musing that it may be necessary to 
quarantine the kaliyani, and that he has secretly placed rudishva 
structural mines (see new technological items) throughout their 
dwellings east of the Midnight Road (see Level 5). These mines are 
on 24 hour timers, and are designed to detonate unless Pliv-Mol 
enters the appropriate code on a daily basis (the code is given as 
“Dipra-Jol” [his partner’s name]).
 These details amount to a full account of the decline of the 
rudishva, as well revealing that the upper leadership expected a 
revolt by the kaliyani (even if they did not prepare for the specific 
nature of it). (A Pliv-Mol; L Rudishva; T data crystal; D 2” long x

##### Diary of Trocadero of Newmarket: Although the initial folio

hand has printed “Ptarmis of Thoth” in blockish Archontean. The 
initial pages of the diary have been torn out, leaving only a handful 
of leaves. These folios describe the finding of the amulet of Ptarmis 
some 20 years ago, and the author’s increasing fascination with the 
Great Cavern and its flora over the next decade. The last entries 
are over five years old, and are almost indecipherable, containing

Divine Power is a Manifestation of Collective Will: This radical 
theological text was deemed heretical and suppressed on four 
separate occasions over a span of 600 years. In it, the unknown 
theologian argues that there are no gods; divine power is nothing 
more than a projection of the collective willpower of like-minded 
ordinary people. According to this theory, spells are concrete 
manifestations of that collective willpower. For obvious reasons, 
the temples opposed this teaching, and the text is now obscure. (A

##### Expedition Notes of Kaitor: This diary was penned some 234 years 
ago by Kaitor, cleric of Heschius Ban, as a record of the expedition 
of Adrienic to recolonize Arden Vul. It is valuable in recording 
candid assessments of the leadership of the various officers who 
led the expedition, including Adrienic, the new archon (a good 
administrator, but arrogant and stubborn); Basil Junienos, his 
second in command (craven and weak; a functionary); Tulliaros, 
polemarch of the 2nd Legion (Sheepshead rangers) (an excellent 
tactician, a sober voice of reason); Maurikios Ligareon, taxiarch 
of the imperial tagmata (standoff-ish and superior, but a good 
disciplinarian); Kallison, cleric of Debellaton and chief clerical 
advisor to Adrienic (a political appointee, and a social bore; but 
powerful and well-loved by his God); Kyrenaios the chartoularios, 
chief administrator (the brains behind Adrienic); the Sacred Band 
(intimidating in their devotion to each other and the mission).
 Some other details are pertinent to the puzzle of Lankios (1-6 
and 5-11): Kaitor relates both his great friendship with Lankios the 
paladin, and his unrequited love for Guivrel. In fact, Kaitor spends 
a fair amount of time mooning over Guivrel; his tone becomes 
more exasperated, and he wonders about the changes he claims to 
be witnessing in her (‘She is becoming mean. Why? Is it me?)
 The diary serves as a convenient summary of the background 
information about Adrienic’s expedition (as found in areas 5-11 
to 5-30). (A Kaitor; L Archontean; T codex; D 5x9x3; W 3 lb; M

##### The First History of the Order of Thoth in Arden Vul: This 
unique volume records the experiences of the priesthood of Thoth 
at Arden Vul. Unlike The Founder and His Deeds (q.v.), this codex 
de-emphasizes the role of Ptoh-Ristus and instead focuses on 
an array of junior administrators, and their exciting discoveries 
beneath the cliff of Arden Vul, discoveries attributable, of course, 
to Thoth, the Light of Comprehension. Much of this reads as a 
travelogue, recounting the exploration of areas that would provide 
the core of the Thothian halls on levels 1-3: the text describes 
discovery, but also the early building projects of the priesthood. 
careful reader would be able to intuit the general location of the 
following areas: 3-9, 3-10, 3-11, 3-22, 3-38, 3-40, 3-66, 3-67, 3-71, 
3-123, 3-163, 3-172, 3-175, ‘the back door’ (3-189), 5-2, 5-6, and 
5-34.
 The text also describes the Thothians first encounters with 
those they call ‘the survivors’, strange beings stranded on Magae 
after the crash of their boat, the Beacon. Particular mention is made 
of Salorikus and Isocrates (see above, Ancient Ones). Reading these 
sections of the codex imparts the following useful information: 
1) the Beacon was a vessel or boat of some sort; 2) the Ancient 
Ones are really old, and the last remnant of their race; 3) a terrible 
cataclysm wiped out the Ancient Ones’ culture, which still holds 
secrets locked behind the Obsidian Gates; 4) a basic knowledge of 
some Rudishva words and glyphs, amounting to a 20% chance to 
recognize a glyph and a 15% chance to recognize a word. (A the

Forging with Arcanum: A unique text scribed by one of the last 
apprentices of the great Sortian arcane smith, Jace Far-Seer. The 
pages describe the process of using arcanum-infused mineral 
waters to create magical works of great power. Serving as the 
foundation for the creation of Sortian magic items, it is particularly 
notable for providing a formula for super-light, arcanum-infused 
Sortian chain mail usable by magic users. Other recipes describe 
the creation of Priscian rings, Priscian gladii, Sortian faces and 
Sortian baculi (see new magic items for all). The current Priscian 
smiths have come to suspect that the recension of the text that they 
possess is incomplete, as they have been unable to permanently 
enchant Sortian chain mail, and have been unable to create Priscian 
rings and Priscian gladii. The smiths are correct, as a crucial quire is 
missing. (A Jace Far-Seer; L Mithric; T codex; D 12x19x6; W 11 lb;

The Formation of the Harmonious Brotherhood: This crystal is 
introduced by a rudishva named Isok-Crix, who proudly reveals 
that he and his ‘brother’, Melok-Ri, have grown alarmed by the 
complacency of the Hegemony and by the failures of the Captain to 
attain any of the promised goals. Consequently, the pair has sworn 
a pact to form a new community based on vigilance, strength, and 
fidelity, one that will not repeat the errors of the past but will point 
towards a new order for the rudishva and their servitors. They call 
their group the “Harmonious Brotherhood.” Images follow of the 
pair in sophisticated, black, rudishva-style armor with high-tech 
weaponry. Later scenes show the addition of five more brothers 
who swear to uphold the pact. The brothers agree to build a cache 
of ‘necessary items’ and then ‘strike out for the surface’, where they 
will dominate the primitive locals and create a new order. Half-
way through the crystal, a new narrator emerges (Melok-Ri). He 
states: “Plans are on hold after we encountered the shape-shifter 
that bit me. I find the bright skies increasingly distressful. The new 
order may be best achieved from a base underground. Some of 
the brothers are having second thoughts. They must be persuaded.” 
 The remainder of the crystal features this group of seven 
rudishva locating and creating the Citadel and Sanctum of the 
Knights (SL10A and SL10B), but also reveals increasing disaffection 
among the group concerning philosophy, goals and agenda. 
Eventually Melok-Ri records, with sadness, that the brotherhood 
was fragmented by the insufficient willpower and fidelity of some 
of its members.
 The fourth crystal describes how Melok-Ri set out to forge 
a new, better brotherhood from ashes of the first. It reveals how 
he ‘recruited’ teenaged humans, how he tested them, and how 
they were initiated into a new Order through a series of rituals 
culminating in scarification (see SL10A-28). He reports bitterly 
that some could not handle the ‘full transformation’, and that he 
has had to eliminate them. Sometime later he reports that yet more 
new recruits, although not brought into full harmony with his own 
nature, have been more acceptable. (A Isok-Crix and Melok-Ri; L

##### The Founder and His Deeds: A lengthy, detailed account of the 
life and adventures of Gnaeus Ricturnus, an Archontean cleric 
of Thoth who took the name Ptoh-Ristus after he was ordered by 
the emperor to found a new temple of Thoth at Arden Vul. The 
text describes his humble origins, his service to Lord Thoth, his 
struggles against evil and the undead, and his eventual founding 
of the new temple at Arden Vul. Of potential interest to readers 
are the long chapters describing Ptoh-Ristus’s travels with the 
legendary heroes, Arden and Vul. The author not surprisingly 
plays up the role of Ptoh-Ristus as a participant in the Ninth Labor 
of Arden (see World of Archontos appendix); Ptoh-Ristus is given 
a heroic role as the one who repulsed the hordes of undead while 
Arden located a musical instrument with which she silenced the 
aulos player. (A Sabaf the Neophyte; L secret tongue of the priests

##### The Fragment: This text is one of the most prized secret texts of 
the modern Priscian cult because it reveals hidden details about 
Priscus Pulcher and the Sortians. Alas, the modern Priscians have 
only a single folio of this work (although two more folios may 
be found in 7-23). The single folio reveals that Priscus Pulcher 
acquired ‘the item’ with ‘the words of power’ that allowed him to 
summon ‘the ancient allies’. The ‘item’ was, of course, the Compact 
of Ennius (see World of Archontos appendix), and the ‘ancient 
allies’ were dragons. Although the single folio does not contain 
those words of power, it makes clear that the ancient allies were 
dragons, and that Priscus had a close friendship with one whose 
name begins with the letters ‘YAS’ (the rest of the name is lost) 
[GM Note: this is Yasidoranicil, aka Isadora - see Sub-Level-11]. 
The additional folios of the Fragment held in 7-23 reveal the full 
name of Yasidoranicil and make clear that she was a gold dragon 
who could take human form; they also reveal much detail about 
the partnership between Priscus and Isadora during the War of 
Sortians and Theosophs.
 Only the uppermost Circles of the Priscian Order are aware of 
the existence of the Fragment; leaders such as Nerub Null (9-64) 
would be most eager to acquire unknown folios from it. Any folios 
(new or old) from the Fragment would be extremely valuable to the 
Archontean authorities. The version held by Kerbog Khan is a copy 
of the one known to the Priscians (e.g., 9-64). (A Anonymous; L

##### Fraternal Triumph, or Taticus and Thekla against the Troll: A 
10,000-line poem in hexameter that describes in glorious detail the 
virtues of the youthful twins, born to a minor chartoularios and 
her husband in the backwards frontier town of Newfort. The twins’ 
excellence in learning, rhetoric, and martial discipline brought 
them to the famous school of Gnaeus the Wisp, fencing master 
in Archontos. There they became celebrated for their stylish but 
effective dueling skills. Eventually, challenged by another pair of 
young aristocrats, the twins journeyed to Kaedigoland on the north 
shore of Borealios, where they challenged and defeated a notorious 
troll that had been terrorizing the local Wiskin population. They 
returned to the Empire, and established their own dueling academy 
in Magger, near to where they grew up. They were buried with full 
imperial honors in Arden Vul.
 While the verse of this poem is excellent, it is perhaps more 
valuable for its description of the marvelous powers of the twins’ 
unusual enchanted rapiers, the Gemini blades (see new magic 
items). (A Verdonius the Blessed; L Mithric; T scroll; D 2x10x2; W

virtuous by getting others to do one’s dirty work. In antiquity 
the work was banned by several of the more pious emperors. (A

unbound quires numbered 1 to 12, these notebooks offer a record 
of hundreds of chess games played by Hithra the Paleologos against 
a series of rivals in the priesthoods and archonal administration 
of Arden Vul. The detailed notes and moves described in the 
volumes are quite valuable, and would serve as a fine tutorial to 
anyone looking to gain advanced skills in chess. Volume 12 is 
devoted to games against “Kel Bormol the Overseer, that cheating, 
untrustworthy snake!” Hithra’s last ten games versus Kel Bormol 
were all losses, and the final entry includes a few frustrated notes: 
“He anticipates my every move! He must be cheating! We shall see 
how he likes a dose of my Useful Palm! I will offer to play him in his 
chambers above the Great Hall, and will even let him play orange for 
once. Let him attempt to cheat the Paleologos once more! He shall 
regret it….” This note provides some context for Hithra’s betrayal 
of his sometime friend, Kel Bormol, a story recounted in more 
detail in area SL3-2A. (A Hithra the Paleologos; L Mithric; T 12

##### The Genealogy of the Deities of Archontos: This dense work 
of theology suggests that the gods of the modern Archontean 
pantheon (the Ten and their companions) are lineal descendants 
of the original pantheon (the Twelve). His argument is complex 
and difficult, and relies on a unique theory of avatar-hood and 
reincarnation as well as on unusual interpretations of mythological 
stories. While the priesthoods reject him completely, systematic 
theologians often find value in Velok’s work. (A Velok the Scholar;

bindings, with numerous gilt illuminations; R uncommon; FoS

##### Gesta Isadorae (i.e., the Deeds of Isadora): Only three copies of 
this text written by a Sortian friend of Priscus Pulcher and Isadora 
are known to exist, and all three are held by high-ranking circularii 
in the Priscian Order. The Priscians value it as a unique window 
into the woman they consider the life-partner of the great mage 
from whom they derive their identity. As such it is one of the three 
core texts of the Priscian Order. That said, the Gesta is remarkably 
circumspect when it comes to secrets (particularly the identity 
of other Sortian figures), preferring to talk about Isadora’s role 
in shaping the decision-making of Priscus in the key events of 
the War of the Sortians and Theosophs. The final chapter, which 
describes how Isadora walked bravely through the jeering crowds 
to remove Priscus’s body from the gallows is of special importance 
to the Priscians, as the episode is not widely known in more general 
histories and it provides the tantalizing suggestion that finding 
Isadora might also mean finding Priscus’s remains. The Priscians 
have been unable to identify the author; Alden is a Thorcin name, 
but their researches have not located a suitable Alden from the 
period. Those Priscians unfamiliar with the Fragment (q.v.) will be 
unaware that Isadora was a dragon (see Sub-Level 11). (A Alden, 
“friend of Isadora”; L Mithric; T codex; D 7x11x5; W 3 lb; M purple 
leather bindings embossed with “P” in gold; vellum folios; R very

##### Great Feats: A long (63 minutes) and somewhat tedious series of 
interviews with grinning varumani who describe in bloody detail 
particularly impressive feats of personal combat against several 
types of heqeti. Anyone viewing this program learns 2-4 specific 
powers or vulnerabilities of heqeti. (A Anonymous; L Rudishva, 
Varumani; T data crystal; D 2” long x 3/4” in diameter; W .5 lb; 
M plastic; R very rare; FoS fauna; SKC amphibians and/or heqeti)

##### Great Vampire Lords and their Demise: Usuon describes the 
rise and fall of seven great vampires from the glory days of the 
Archontean Empire. Intended to be a shocking, coffee-table style 
book, it actually offers much useful information to potential 
vampire-hunters. Any thorough reader will become fully apprised 
of a vampire’s main magical powers, and gains a +1 bonus to resist 
a vampire’s charm attack. (A Usuon of Agoreon; L; Mithric T 
codex; D 14x18x5; W 8 lb; M calf-hide bindings; parchment folios; 
R rare; FoS humankind, supernatural and unusual; SKC history,

##### Great Villains of Archontos, part I: Secunda the Witch: The 
first entry in the conservative and stuffy Yeng’s popular series of 
‘histories’ designed for a general audience. Secunda was the grand-
daughter of that Ennius whose compact with the Ancient Allies 
is understood as the foundation of Archontean greatness; she 
became one of the first female arch-mages in Archontean history. 
 In Yeng’s telling (375 years ago), Secunda merits the status 
of villain for having used magic to bewitch Marcus Basileus 
(founder of the Basileon clan) into hiding the compact of Ennius 
and concealing its terms from the general population. Yeng’s 
argument is thus that Secunda’s actions are the reason that modern 
Archonteans are left in the dark about the nature of the compact 
and the Ancient Allies. (A Yeng of Narsileon; L Archontean; T 
codex; D 10x15x4; W 5 lb; M troll-hide bindings, parchment
